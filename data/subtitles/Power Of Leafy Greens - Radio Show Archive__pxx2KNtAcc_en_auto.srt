46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,840
leafy greens you're not getting enough

47
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,799
celery juice you're not getting any

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,640
celery juice how about that I mean do

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,360
does everybody have years of celery

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,439
juice behind them in their in their

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,520
whole being of their whole nature of who

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,360
they are and their existence their

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,039
physical nature all these years no they

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,080
don't they don't have that some people

55
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,560
think juicing is just it's just not a

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,599
good thing that you don't have to juice

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,480
that back a long time ago no one had

58
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,680
juicers so why should we use them now

59
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,280
back in the caveman time nobody was

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,080
juicing so why do we need them now

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,080
because we're in a different world right

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,040
now toxins pollutants liver

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,040
troublemakers poisons that saturate the

64
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,120
liver all kinds of different viruses

65
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,959
bacteria everything we're up against now

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,000
we need every Edge we can get and guess

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,000
what everybody's digestive tract is

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,599
basically annihilated by these things

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,120
okay B bad bacteria by the millions and

70
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,120
billions inside their intestinal tract

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,760
and sometimes really bad versions of

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,120
bacteria bad strep aactas causing sibo

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,840
ecoli different groups of ecoli

74
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,480
different varieties of SEI all kinds of

75
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,599
Staff all kinds of fungus sitting inside

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,040
our intestinal tract

77
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,360
thriving and taking up space making it

78
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,000
harder to absorb what we need to absorb

79
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,319
our nutrients juicing is one of those

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,400
lifesaving elements life-saving elements

81
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,440
I juice every morning and I take my

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,799

84
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,239
juicer there is out there there's no

85
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,760
question about it I know all the juicers

86
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,400

is incredible it's the one I use I run

90
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,120
my celery through there every single

91
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,840
morning I make sure there's leafy greens

92
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,040
in my diet you know people say well what

93
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,840
do you eat Anthony what do you eat

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,000
what's your whole thing I'll tell you

95
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,879
what I do eat I'll tell you something

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,319
that's in my diet and it's no secret

97
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:50,879
okay it's leafy greens it's drinking

98
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,079
celery juice absolutely but here's the

99
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,360
key no matter what you do in your diet

100
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,920
whatever you believe in I'm going to

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,000
tell you right now also I want to back

102
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,159
up a little bit we also need the potency

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,079
and the quantity of the juice that's

104
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,920
critical we can't get that just from

105
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,159
eating so we do need to eat our leafy

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,760
greens because we get we get lots of

107
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,840
minerals lots of nutrients from that too

108
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,000
but we also still have to juice we have

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,479
to juice our celery we have to juice

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,600
other things too not just celery and so

111
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,639
we do have to keep this in mind you know

112
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,240
I like the juice just straight celery

113
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,240
and then I like to eat my leafy greens

114
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,639
and I'm going to talk about it all too

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,320
and we're up against so much so many

116
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,520
pollutant so many toxins so much stress

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,520
so much adrenaline when you get stressed

118
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:45,800
out okay your adrenals Purge and flood

119
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,680
they Purge and flood that's what happens

120
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,120
that adrenaline is toxic abrasive it's

121
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,600
poisonous it's like a battery acid it's

122
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,520
corrosive it gets in the intestinal

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,320
lining that that adrenaline gets into

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,400
the intestinal lining and it burns the

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,280
lining scor pures it making it a

126
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,919
campground for bad bacteria it kills

127
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,199
good bacteria our own adrenaline from

128
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:13,759
when we're under stress destroys our

129
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:16,840
good bacteria in our guts our good

130
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,919
microorganisms in our guts and as all

131
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,720
our good microorganisms and our good

132
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,600
bacteria start to disappear over time

133
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,280
from all that adrenaline scorching it

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,080
and all the pollutants and poisons we

135
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,960
end up eating all these foods that feed

136
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,880
bad bacteria so we're still eating some

137
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,520
eggs cuz we think eggs are healthy we

138
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,840
think eggs are in a healthy diet now we

139
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,199
we think that they're healthy right

140
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,919
meanwhile they're not they feed viruses

141
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,520
bacteria pathogens microorganisms and

142
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,479
when they when all your good bacteria is

143
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,240
disappearing from stress okay and

144
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,800
adrenaline scorching the Linings of the

145
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,800
intestinal tract and colon and all the

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,120
way up to dadum and everywhere when that

147
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,600
happens we start eating we're eating bad

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,280
food too we think we're getting a

149
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,560
moderation diet good moderation diet

150
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,479
we're eating a good healthy raw cheese

151
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
maybe we're eating some eggs we think

152
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,400
we're doing good for ourselves a little

153
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,120
grass-fed butter these things feed

154
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,680
bacteria they feed viruses but this may

155
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,440
not hit us all at once it takes a few

156
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,400
years for this to kind of happen and

157
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,400
roll in and kind of Roll Along and then

158
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,720
we start getting our first symptoms we

159
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,639
start getting our first issues we start

160
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,360
getting the bloating you know gas

161
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,720
gastritis we start getting different

162
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,880
things happening cramps and all kinds of

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,199
stuff and bad breath and all these

164
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,720
different things and our proteins rot in

165
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,440
our gut and the fats that we're eating

166
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,880
because we're all on high fat diets turn

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,160
ran it and Cake the Linings we got the

168
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,160
bad bacteria proliferating and thriving

169
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,680
off of all this the good bacteria is

170
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,000
diminishing and diminishing and

171
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,639
probiotics doesn't cut it a probiotic

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,960
won't do it won't take care of it and

173
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,440
that's why if we're not doing that

174
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,800
celery juice we're not doing that herb

175
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,199
and if we're not doing that powerful

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,840
herb the celery juice and we're not

177
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,800
getting our leafy greens in when we need

178
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
to like a spinach soup which I'm going

179
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,800
to talk about in a little while and

180
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,160
other things we're not replenishing

181
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,560
we're not killing off the bad bacteria

182
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,840
as well see everybody thinks probiotic

183
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,919
Prebiotic probiotic they're thinking all

184
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,120
that kind of thing right but probiotic

185
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,680
doesn't kill bad bacteria if you're

186
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,919
loaded with bad bacteria that's already

187
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,840
been thriving you could take all the

188
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,680
probiotics you want that doesn't stop

189
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,560
bad bacteria a probiotic isn't a killer

190
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,280
of streptococus it's not a killer of

191
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:36,080
coli is the very things that create sibo

192
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,639
um sinusitis the very all mucus and

193
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,759
discharge loose you know loose bowels

194
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,840
when you're not supposed to have loose

195
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,800
bowels mucus in the stool gas cramps

196
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,800
bloating ulcers I'm just naming a few

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,319
diverticulosis diverticulitis I'm just

198
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,599
naming a few things

199
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,520
appendicitis you know eoli and strep and

200
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,000
strep in our system creates all this

201
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,159
rosacea it's another one too all that

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,599
can just from all this down in there and

203
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,400
you think a probiotic is the fixer of

204
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,319
that you know when I see a commercial on

205
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,240
television or something when I'm I was

206
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,360
at a friend's office and I was waiting

207
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,000
because I was I was going to go out to

208
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,199
lunch with them and you know I'm waiting

209
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,680
and and I'm in their office and there's

210
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,960
a TV on in the office and it's sitting

211
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,400
there and I see a commercial of a

212
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,960
probiotic like it's this big answer and

213
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,759
then it's funny I saw a commercial after

214
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,520
of fish oil fish oil the very thing that

215
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,919
actually feeds feeds all viruses is fish

216
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,800
oil cuz the Mercury to trace the trace

217
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,320
essence of mercury left in every single

218
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,399
fish oil capsule there ever was and it

219
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,440
feed feeds all that bacteria and all

220
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,519
that that viral stuff it's amazing the

221
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,000
world we live in where the information

222
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,560
is so still backwards not helpful I I

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,279
almost think sometimes it's just meant

224
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,800
to be that way just to keep people down

225
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,519
and keep women down keep women kind down

226
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,399
you know I just really believe so I

227
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,760
believe that the systems actually set up

228
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,079
to hurt people but the professionals

229
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,320
don't really know that I mean they

230
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,399
they're they're just they're all they're

231
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,440
trying to help people I get that but the

232
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,519
bottom line is is that probiotic you're

233
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,399
taking cannot kill off the bad bacteria

234
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,760
that's already been growing over time

235
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,680
for a long time and you need to do

236
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,600
something bigger and better than that

237
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,920
and leafy greens come into play if

238
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,680
they're not enough leafy greens in your

239
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,760
diet I promise you we're going to have

240
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,680
problems later I I look I'd rather be

241
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,360
straight out I've always been straight

242
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,519
out with you guys always have I love

243
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,519
hearing sometimes out there and YouTube

244
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,040
land and other places and all that and

245
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,279
lectures and stuff when people say that

246
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,480
they're straight out with them and then

247
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,959
you're listening to the information

248
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,480
you're like okay sure sure meanwhile

249
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,959
it's just nothing but propaganda to the

250
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,399
usual stuff to the usual songs everybody

251
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,760
singing listen I'm being straight out

252
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,920
that's why I've always delivered the

253
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,279
information to the core the reality of

254
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,519
it if I wasn't I'd be all about

255
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,760
probiotics 247 and trying to sell you

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,320
going on so let's go let's go into leafy

267
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,959
greens have a living microorganisms on

268
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,440
them think about that how can that be

269
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,320
possible you go to your go to your

270
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,720
Farmers Market Market in the summertime

271
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,560
in the fall in the spring you get any

272
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,760
leafy greens whatsoever or any leafy

273
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:42,240
green herbs cilantro parsley you get any

274
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,079
of these herbs there's microorganisms

275
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,560
riddled on there you don't want to wash

276
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,320
them thoroughly you just want to rinse

277
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,120
them off and get any dirt off or

278
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,240
anything and that's fine kale out of the

279
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,040
garden there's microorganisms on there

280
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,160
they're called elevated biotics

281
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,360
undiscovered still by research and

282
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,480
science I brought elevated bi biotics I

283
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,480
brought that to the world through spirit

284
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,800
and spirit's information I put it in

285
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,160
book one medical medium book one okay

286
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,200
that's the one with the chest x-ray on

287
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,320
the cover so if you go to Amazon or you

288
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,160
go and look for it you'll see the

289
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,279
medical medium book one and and that has

290
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,120
a chest x-ray on it's like a blue cover

291
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,440
you'll see that right there secrets

292
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,839
behind chronic illness and how to

293
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:28,160
finally heal so here's the deal is

294
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:30,399
elevated biotics is only on these fresh

295
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,240
fruits and leav leafy greens you can get

296
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,959
from farmers markets pick off a tree

297
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,279
pick out of your garden or growing

298
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,480
Sprouts if you grow Sprouts in your

299
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,079
kitchen you grow some different Sprouts

300
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,800
in your kitchen you can brow grow

301
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,760
broccoli Sprouts fenig Greek Sprouts you

302
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,200
can grow different kind of um Sprouts

303
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,360
that are really helpful red clover

304
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,760
sprouts and when you're doing that the

305
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,160
microorganisms they will just appear on

306
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,720
these leaves naturally in the wild even

307
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,800
on your kitchen counter on a sprout they

308
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,200
will they will prosper on there these

309
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,720
are the very microorganisms that create

310
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,079
the B12 inside your body so when you're

311
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:12,240
doing leafy greens you're getting your

312
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:14,680
own B12 restored by your own body using

313
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,880
microorganisms that come from these

314
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,560
leafy greens called elevated biotics

315
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,240
that end up in your Elum of your

316
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,440
intestinal tract creating abundance of

317
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,040
B12 so you can heal and lose methylation

318
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,880
issues and actually heal and Rise Above

319
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,639
methylation problems which are liver

320
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,120
issues um vitamins can being converted

321
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,480
issues all these different issues that

322
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,600
happen in fact the MTHFR gene mutation

323
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,480
you won't even get that to ring up at a

324
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,160
doctor's office through their testing

325
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,040
that's basically just an elevation of

326
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,079
inflammation test anyway but it won't

327
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,120
even ring up if you're getting enough of

328
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,639
these elevated biotics through leafy

329
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,760
greens into your body that end up in

330
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,839
your elium producing B12 and gets you

331
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,600
out of trouble this is a lot of

332
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,720
information it's a lot of information

333
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,240
but it's here for you so that you can

334
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,120
heal and move forward so here's the deal

335
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,880
we're growing all this bad bacteria in

336
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,360
our guts bad microorganisms in our guts

337
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,199
we're growing it all it's prospering we

338
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,079
got the strep we got the eoli we got all

339
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:18,519
the different varieties of bad bacteria

340
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,839
so many so it's not even cataloged or

341
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,600
calculated by any science or or research

342
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,440
or any kind of any kind of institution

343
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,320
none of them have their fingers on all

344
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,440
the different bad bacteria that's inside

345
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:34,240
of us but it grows it prospers and it

346
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,120
and it develops and as it develops we

347
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,959
need something to knock it out something

348
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,040
to sweep it out something to eliminate

349
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:45,079
it out leafy greens not only have like

350
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,839
your own that you grow in your garden or

351
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,959
you grow at the or you get at the Farm's

352
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,519
Market not only do they have these

353
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,680
microorganisms called elevated biotics

354
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,920
to it to actually repopulate your

355
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,519
intestinal tract unlike any probiotic

356
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,240
can ever or any kind of soil born

357
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,639
microorganism can ever not only are

358
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,800
these elevated bi biotics that powerful

359
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,240
and can

360
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,600
repopulate but the leafy

361
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,920
green can sweep it sweeps the walls of

362
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,959
the intestinal tract lining gently

363
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,880
caressing the walls a lot of people

364
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,920
think greens are hard and difficult to

365
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,560
digest but they're easy to digest

366
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,440
they're super easy they're very leafy

367
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,600
greens are actually predigested

368
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,720
practically they're easy to digest

369
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,079
that's not the problem it's just that

370
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,040
the fiber content touches gently

371
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,519
massages and touches the intestinal

372
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,720
track so it touches the dadum and small

373
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,880
intestinal tract and colon and people

374
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,639
who are inflamed automatically from

375
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,639
colonies of eoli and colonies of strepto

376
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,079
coctus because they have all these

377
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,120
colonies of bad bacteria they're

378
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,880
elevated with inflammation they also

379
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,240
have the shingles virus they also have

380
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,639
the epscene bar clinging to the walls of

381
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
their int inal tracts and Linings and

382
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,160
when you have all that and bad fungus

383
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,320
not candida that's a good fungus bad

384
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,160
fungus when they have bad fungus all

385
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,880
clinging to the walls of the intestinal

386
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,639
tract the nerves on the intestinal tract

387
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,720
Linings get hyp sensitive so that if

388
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,800
you're not eating something really soft

389
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,720
like a piece of gooey bread that sits in

390
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,360
the middle of your digestive tract or

391
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,160
you're not eating some eggs that turns

392
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,079
into straight goo in the middle of your

393
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,480
digestive tract or having something like

394
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,519
a piece of ham that just sits there in

395
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,560
the middle of your intestinal tract if

396
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,839
you're not eating like simple things

397
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,000
like that or something soft and smooth

398
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,480
you know soft and smooth something that

399
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,759
feels like it's not abrasive and it

400
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,040
becomes gooey inside of you or something

401
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,040
like chicken just plain chicken which

402
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,480
doesn't rub on the sides of the

403
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,040
intestinal tract Linings and colon it

404
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,040
collects there over time the chicken fat

405
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,120
gets rancid and it collects on there and

406
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,319
I'm not saying that because I'm

407
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,839
anti-animal products or Pro Pro vegan or

408
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:04,160
Pro an animal or Pro whatever that's not

409
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,440
what it is I'm just saying it like it is

410
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,839
what would when these things like eggs

411
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,720
and all this gets gooey you don't feel

412
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,040
it you don't feel it move through you

413
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,639
don't feel it move through and because

414
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,959
you don't feel it move through what

415
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,680
happens is you think you're digesting it

416
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,560
and you think you're digesting it fine

417
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,279
you see how it works you eat some

418
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,399
lettuce and you're just like I can't

419
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,279
digest lettuce it's cuz you're feeling

420
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,079
it you're already inflamed now this

421
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,440
isn't everybody but there's a lot of

422
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,959
people that have this elevated

423
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,399
inflammation in their intestinal tracts

424
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,440
and Linings and all that but see the

425
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,800
leafy greens go in and they clean up

426
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,720
those rancid fats and proteins that are

427
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,000
rotting and also feeding bacteria in the

428
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,839
intestinal walls and I'm going to go

429
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,120
into that a little deeper in a minute so

430
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,720
what I'm trying to tell you is the

431
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,519
sensitive nerves in your intestinal

432
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,440
tract and colon those sensitive nerves

433
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,199
are because we're inflamed by viruses

434
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,440
like the shingles sitting in there

435
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:58,800
causing mild colitis and the Celiac

436
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,519
which is caused by bacteria and viruses

437
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,240
and all these different conditions of

438
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,160
the intestinal tract the bowels getting

439
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,240
inflamed pockets in the bowels pockets

440
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,240
in the colon that expand so expansions

441
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,319
in the small intestinal tract where it's

442
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,760
going normal and then boo it Puffs out

443
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,799
like it's herniated you know we have all

444
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,600
that in all of our guts and then

445
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,919
shrinking in intestinal tract where

446
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,600
there's narrowing people have narrowing

447
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,400
so when something's kind of squeezing

448
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,160
through if it's not gooey and soft and

449
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,080
squeezing through like eggs being gooey

450
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,160
after you chew it and turns into just a

451
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,360
mucus ball as you swallow it and you

452
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,320
know goes down you know if that's going

453
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,080
through those little narrowings then you

454
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,400
don't really feel it so bad even though

455
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,760
it's still feeding the problem and

456
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,280
feeding the very bacteria that creates

457
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,559
intestinal tract wall narrowings so all

458
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,840
of that but when you start eating a

459
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,360
little leafy green and you're one of

460
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,000
these sensitive Critters and you start

461
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,559
eating some leafy green say oh I don't

462
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,280
not digesting good because your nerves

463
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,039
are feeling it you know you're feeling

464
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,200
it because you feel something it's

465
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,240
touching the walls of everything what

466
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,120
it's doing it's sweeping it's cleaning

467
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,400
it's doing the cleanup it's touching

468
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,039
rancid fats rotting proteins that have

469
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,559
been there for years that are feeding

470
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,159
all the bad bacteria it's touching all

471
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:17,080
this stuff see so it's cleaning up the

472
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,799
system that's a whole another thing the

473
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,039
leafy greens do but what else do they do

474
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:25,840
they leave trace minerals behind that

475
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:29,760
feed good bacteria they're prebiotics

476
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,280
celery juice in herb is a pre biotic it

477
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,320
feeds all of the good bacteria that's

478
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,360
what it does the good thing about celery

479
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,960
juice I talk about my celery juice book

480
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,240
medical medium celery juice you got to

481
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,679
pick up that book you won't be

482
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,400
disappointed I promise what what's in

483
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,480
there and I can't explain it all here

484
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,200
it's impossible it's too big of a book

485
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,039
but what's in there is that celery

486
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,400
juices sodium cluster salts they hit the

487
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,799
bad bacteria they hit it the sodium

488
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,520
cluster salt hits the bad bacteria sucks

489
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:04,799
the life out of it pulls it apart cleans

490
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,880
out that bad bacteria the poison inside

491
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:11,000
of it the carcass of the bacteria ends

492
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:15,039
up being now fuel for good bacteria your

493
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,159
good bacteria devours the bad bacteria

494
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,720
because the sodium cluster salted celery

495
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:22,880
juice allowed that to happen it actually

496
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,679
allowed that to happen is what it did so

497
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,360
then when that good bacteria is feeding

498
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,240
off of the Dead bad bacteria it's

499
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,760
getting refueled

500
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,720
and then that's how we're we're

501
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,000
prospering even more and more there's so

502
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,039
many good things about why you want to

503
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,679
do the celery juices the herb the leafy

504
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:41,280
greens all of it celery juice is not a

505
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,600
leafy green it's got leafy greens on

506
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,320
celery okay so the stocks you buy the

507
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,000
whole bit there's leafy greens on there

508
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,120
so it is partly a leafy green okay but

509
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,039
it is an herb but I like the leafy green

510
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,720
herbs the cilantro The Parsley the

511
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,840
celery I like these in your life These

512
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,640
Are Powerful in the leaf leafy green

513
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,400
herb family that I want you to be on and

514
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,360
celery juice and leafy greens go hand

515
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,400
inand together to recover illness to

516
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,120
stay healthy so we have to remember that

517
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,280
you can't just if you want to just do

518
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,520
leafy greens it's great bringing leafy

519
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,120
greens in your diet now want to talk

520
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,559
about quantities and all that as we go

521
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,360
along so I hope you guys all hang in

522
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,880
there for this because we got so much to

523
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,440
talk about but you have to have the

524
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,760
celery juice too these are some of the

525
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:32,720
tickets I can't tell you how many people

526
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:37,159
that are plant-based fail in their

527
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,280
plant-based diet fail in their

528
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:41,760
recoveries because they don't have any

529
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,559
celery juice in there or not enough or

530
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,679
they only tried it once or no no leafy

531
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:51,120
greens in there too it happens all the

532
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:54,400
time all the people that leave the

533
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,159
plant-based movement all of them that's

534
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,760
that ended up going to a doctor a

535
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,159
functional medicine doctor that believed

536
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,760
in Pro protein protein protein and

537
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,320
they're not getting enough protein and

538
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,640
it was the it was the vegan diet that

539
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,760
hurt them you know they hear that and

540
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,080
they just they wa back and forth or they

541
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,039
just they start heading to animal

542
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,159
protein Kingdom again and they start

543
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:14,520
heading there they're always they're

544
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,880
always at that point where they they

545
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,120
lose out because they never did enough

546
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,760
leafy greens they never knew about the

547
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,679
28 day cleanse in book one medical

548
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,039
medium book one they never knew about uh

549
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,480
the 369 in Liver Rescue and that's the

550
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,919
thing and I'm even talking about the

551
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,320
plant-based movement where it was all

552
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,279
high carb and low fat that plant-based

553
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,400
movement there's a plant-based movement

554
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:39,440
where it was lowfat um high carb they

555
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,039
never did enough leafy greens they did a

556
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,080
handful of romae lettuce that was the

557
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,880
big thing it's some Ro Roma lettuce once

558
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,640
in a while they they eat a lot of fruit

559
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,600
a lot of starches but they didn't do

560
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,640
celery juice and they didn't do leafy

561
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,000
greens and that's how it works and I

562
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,559
can't tell you how many people in the

563
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,240
Paleo movement the non- plant-based

564
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,799
movement where it's paleo or keto animal

565
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,400
protein or high animal protein or some

566
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,559
kind of Mediterranean or animal protein

567
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,919
whatever it is where they get sick they

568
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,960
get sick but it's never blamed on their

569
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,960
diet it's never blamed on their diet

570
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,000
ever I mean it's always blamed on the

571
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,440
plant-based person all you do is have to

572
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,320
cough once and that's it it's your diet

573
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,080
that's what happens that's what

574
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,520
everybody says you can't escape that you

575
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,200
have to walk on water as a plant-based

576
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,200
person you can't H you can't even have

577
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,679
flatulence as a plant-based person you

578
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,360
can't have bad breath as a plant-based

579
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,799
person cuz it's your diet causing it you

580
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,400
can't have anything wrong but when your

581
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:38,039
animal protein is some kind no matter

582
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,080
what it is it's never blamed on diet no

583
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,360
way it's just hey look that you're

584
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,039
getting enough protein that's all that

585
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,080
matters okay let's go look at some there

586
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,600
something else that is it's probably

587
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,200
your genetics or your body's attacking

588
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,640
itself or something El or it's your

589
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,480
metabolism or something that's what be

590
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,240
thrown at that person or you're not

591
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,320
exercising enough or you're not maybe

592
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,240
you're eating too much maybe you had too

593
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,799
much fruit one day five years ago here's

594
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,200
the point

595
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:07,080
okay I never said ever just to eat fruit

596
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,200
I never ever ever told anyone in my life

597
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,440
to just meaning

598
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,120
someone someone that didn't have a

599
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,679
particular problem not like I remember a

600
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,760
long long time ago there was this child

601
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:21,120
that could not eat anything and the mom

602
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,039
took this child everywhere didn't matter

603
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,480
what this child would do or couldn't eat

604
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,159
anything there wouldn't be best doctors

605
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:32,760
in the world she flew her she flew her

606
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,559
son around the world to the best clinics

607
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,279
best conventional clinics there were on

608
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:41,559
the planet all around the globe us

609
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,480
abroad everywhere and the child couldn't

610
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,840
e

611
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,000
anything and then okay spirit said

612
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,000
bananas is going to be the key and the

613
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,640
child ate bananas and ate bananas only

614
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,520
and recovered and it saved the child's

615
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,240
life now the child's actually just

616
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,559
filled with muscle strong and adult now

617
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,919
and living life has children has a

618
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,480
family and it's because of those bananas

619
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,200
and I've seen that too with Papaya but

620
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,480
see these are different circumstances

621
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,480
these are very trying difficult times of

622
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,720
food poisoning very very very trying

623
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,840
different difficult times and even then

624
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,600
the leafy greens had to come in later

625
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,080
they still had to come in in order to

626
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,960
sustain that so there's like people who

627
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,840
have gone through heck and back with

628
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,320
food poisoning critical food po

629
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,760
poisoning issues you know I've seen more

630
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,679
than one case of a child that could only

631
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,640
eat banana too it's just there's been

632
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,480
more than one cases over the last three

633
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,120
years I talked to doctors where a doctor

634
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,279
said you know what it's unbelievable

635
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,159
it's it had a child that was it could

636
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,399
not eat anything would didn't matter

637
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,200
what it was it' be debilitating cramping

638
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:54,080
except for except for banana and I even

639
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,520
I even saw that when I was talking to a

640
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,360
doctor we had a big conversation about

641
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,320
it one time and so I've seen a doctor go

642
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,600
through that too where it saved a

643
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,200
child's life but the leafy greens have

644
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,360
to come later same thing with you know

645
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,159
people when they get severe food

646
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,760
poisoning papaya is the only thing you

647
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,120
can give them when I had food poisoning

648
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,440
as a child when I had severe food

649
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,360
poisoning as a

650
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,919
child um the only thing that worked for

651
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:23,320
me spirit said was pears was pears okay

652
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,679
so I got these right pears off my my

653
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,480
great-grandfather's tree and I had an

654
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,640
abundance of them for like two or three

655
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,720
straight weeks and I lived off of these

656
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,840
pears until I can bring in some leafy

657
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,320
greens and bring in some celery juice

658
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,159
the point is is that that's the only

659
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:45,080
times I've ever ever ever recommended or

660
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,000
seen wear fruit on its own for a certain

661
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,000
purpose and there are these certain rare

662
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,159
situations but other than that everybody

663
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,679
have ever talked to recommended a diet

664
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,520
or or some kind of food regime or some

665
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,200
kind of food you know food s uh system

666
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,720
some kind of recovery system leafy

667
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,799
greens were in there celery juice was in

668
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,919
there other things were in there besides

669
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:10,880
fruit and so but fruit is really it's an

670
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:13,720
important key to our health and we can't

671
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,440
lose that but the bottom line is when

672
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,039
you're plant-based whether you're

673
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,919
plant-based in in in the mindset of say

674
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,480
low carb lowfat plant-based you have to

675
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,399
have those leafy greens or the celery

676
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,799
juice and you have to have them long

677
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:28,799
enough long enough it can't be for one

678
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,760
month in your life out of 5 years of

679
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,399
being plant-based it's just it's just

680
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,399
that you're going to miss out same thing

681
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:37,200
with paleo same same with keto same with

682
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:38,480
any kind of other diet animal protein if

683
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,279
you're not doing the leafy greens in the

684
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,720
celery juice you're going to end up

685
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:45,640
having problems you're going to have

686
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,520
problems because it's the missing link

687
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:52,760
and I've been saying this since day one

688
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:54,760
day one going back decades now decades

689
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,600
it's the missing link it's that critical

690
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,600
and you have to take it that

691
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,679
seriously it's not just the mineral

692
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,159
salts that you have to have which are

693
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,200
critical for our life the trace mineral

694
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:06,279
salts it's a phytochemical compounds

695
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,840
it's the

696
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,440
alkaloids it's all of it that's in these

697
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,399
leafy greens it's the

698
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,880
antioxidants it's the trace mineral

699
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:17,320
nutrients it's all of that it's a

700
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,600
micronutrients it's even more than that

701
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,120
it's an energy in the leafy green

702
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,440
there's an energy within the leafy green

703
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,240
for the human body there's a symbiotic

704
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,559
relationship that they need each other

705
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,120
it's so critical if we want to go in

706
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,279
that direction I know I don't go in that

707
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,760
direction all the time or I talk about

708
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,799
that but it's that important and there's

709
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,240
vegan diets and plant-based diets that

710
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,000
actually are they're not about the

711
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,640
lowfat ones they're all about the keto

712
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,360
vegan keto plant-based it's all about

713
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,519
heavy fats all the time the nut Butters

714
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,240
the nuts and everything else and the

715
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,080
oils and the coconut oil and everything

716
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,720
like that where's the leafy greens

717
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,640
where's all the leafy greens and that's

718
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,399
why that crowd tends to go away from

719
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,159
vegan eventually once they start getting

720
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,279
sick or they're losing some weight and

721
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,519
they're getting a little bit better in

722
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,919
different ways because they cut out glut

723
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,679
and they cut out dairy products they cut

724
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,440
out animal proteins and they end up

725
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,159
getting sick too because we all have

726
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,000
things in us and troublemakers and heavy

727
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:14,840
metals and it's not coming out and leafy

728
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,640
greens helps get those out get the bad

729
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,799
bacteria out get the viruses out a

730
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,600
little bit get the toxic heavy metals

731
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,640
out get the poisons out of the liver so

732
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,200
you don't get sick so no matter where

733
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,080
you go on what diet front you want to be

734
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,720
on without the leafy greens and the

735
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,799
celery juice you're lost it's amazing

736
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,760
and you know it's not like this

737
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,480
information's out there spirit's the

738
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,840
only one putting this information out

739
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,080
there that's it it's coming from Spirit

740
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,440
it's coming from up there and and that's

741
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,760
where I get the information if you

742
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,039
haven't if you don't know anything about

743
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,279
the medical medium but the point is is

744
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:49,799
that that's where it has to come from

745
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:52,240
because no one else has ever talked

746
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:54,440
about it it's it's unbelievable we're

747
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,679
still stuck in that whole protein World

748
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,360
high fat world and and we're all still

749
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,120
stuck in that not eating enough leafy

750
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,200
greens and and all of that so it's

751
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:06,039
important leafy greens hold precious and

752
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,039
vital mineral salts partially composed

753
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:10,080
of a group of co-actors associated with

754
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,440
sodium and in the case of celery juice

755
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,519
it's a sodium cluster salt which is

756
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,440
entirely different than what's in a

757
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:17,080
leafy green but in the spinach there's

758
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,960
this partially comp there's this group

759
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:23,039
of co-actors associated with sodium that

760
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:26,799
group of co-actors is powerful too such

761
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,399
as Trace bioavailable iodine chromium

762
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:33,000
sulfur magnesium calcium potassium

763
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:34,440
silica manganese and malinam you know

764
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,399
all of that critical for

765
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,120
neurotransmitter and neuros support

766
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,919
neuron support the foundation the

767
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,399
building blocks the electrolytes all of

768
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,159
that see the electrolytes they come from

769
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,559
the celery juice especially the celery

770
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,840
juice nothing beats that but the but the

771
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,480
leafy greens also hold these different

772
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,320
constituents these different things of

773
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,960
electrolytes these different Power

774
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,840
sources electrolytes the different

775
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,519
groups of electrolytes too so we can get

776
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,880
some of those from there these leafy

777
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,559
greens are high in enzymes enzymatic

778
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,559
power celery juice has like in the

779
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,919
celery juice book the medical medium

780
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,480
celery juice book you'll read about the

781
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,240
enzymes and celery juice which is

782
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,360
unmatched but still the leafy greens you

783
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,880
need those enzymes too vitamin A vitamin

784
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,559
B folic acid alkaloids healing alkaloids

785
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,039
plant compounds that fight disease are

786
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:28,159
in Leafy grains and if you're only

787
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,799
eating a handful once a while in a mixed

788
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,039
green salad at a restaurant it's not

789
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:36,360
going to be enough micronutrients for

790
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:38,640
restoring the endocrine system the power

791
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,320
these leafy greens have providing

792
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,960
micronutrients to restore the endocrine

793
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:48,200
system these unique groups of nutrients

794
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,559
working together to feed all organ

795
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,360
systems all the organ systems that's the

796
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:55,360
power I'm talking about from leafy

797
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,120
greens so guess what let's just throw

798
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,480
all that away who cares

799
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,799
let's just make sure you get plenty of

800
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,080
eggs let's just make sure you get you

801
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:05,720
know some turkey let's just make sure

802
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,440
you get plenty of nuts and N Butters if

803
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,200
you're vegan let's just make sure you

804
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,840
get plenty of avocado and some oils and

805
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,639
maybe get some fish oil too take some

806
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,120
fish oil capsules take some whe protein

807
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:17,480
powder you know I'm kidding right I

808
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,519
don't want you on any of that really and

809
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,720
make sure make sure you're getting you

810
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,000
know let's just say let's make sure

811
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,200
let's let's focus on oatmeal I mean

812
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,639
there's nothing wrong with oatmeal but

813
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,240
the point is is that's what I'm saying

814
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:34,200
is without these leafy greens everything

815
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:37,279
else will fall flat it will fall flat it

816
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,159
won't be enough not in this world not

817
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,799
with what's going on in this world not

818
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:42,799
the viruses and bacteria and everything

819
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,159
else we're up against in this world not

820
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,480
with all the chronic illness and the

821
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,919
suffering and the anxiety and the

822
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,600
depression and the memory loss and the

823
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,200
brain fog that we're dealing in this

824
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,600
world and the headaches and the

825
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
migraines and the Tinkles and numbness

826
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,480
and vertigo and aches and pains and

827
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,919
ringing in the ears and body aches body

828
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,519
burning all that different stuff body

829
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,919
burning that's the body feeling like

830
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,519
it's on fire the skin rashes lupus

831
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,440
related rashes ecus ricis all related

832
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,399
rashes all the different problems

833
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,840
everybody has it's not going to be

834
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,320
enough it's going to fall flat without

835
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,240
the leafy greens and celery juice that's

836
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,120
it I look you know I mean I'm just kind

837
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,559
I just got to tell

838
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,240
you you know I got to keep on going I

839
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,760
got to keep on going that's what I have

840
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,679
to do wake up in the morning and say

841
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,440
let's what can I do for everybody bu

842
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,120
what can I do how can I help you greens

843
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,639
are the most bioavailability for for the

844
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,159
protein aspect too and I don't even care

845
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:40,039
about that I don't care about protein

846
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,960
protein protein because there's protein

847
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:46,760
in everything protein's not the problem

848
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,240
if we if we were like if we weren't sick

849
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,639
in this world and the whole world wasn't

850
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,559
getting sick I mean then you then look I

851
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:56,159
mean if protein was the answer the whole

852
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,840
world's getting sick what does it make

853
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,320
any sense think about it so there's

854
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,159
plenty of protein in Greens there's

855
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,639
plenty of protein in all foods it's not

856
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,440
even the problem but if you're worried

857
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:08,360
about if you're one of those protein

858
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,799
people then don't have any fear there's

859
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,320
protein and greens that's the thing and

860
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,919
the thing is with the greens the protein

861
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,440
and greens no other protein touches it

862
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,080
it's the best protein there is even

863
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,679
though it's actually the mineral salts

864
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,720
not the protein in the leafy greens the

865
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,200
body needs to build muscle with the

866
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:29,720
proteins are still good in in leafy

867
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:33,320
greens building muscle all hinges upon a

868
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:36,720
carbohydrate and mineral salts building

869
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:39,480
muscle all hinges upon a

870
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,679
carbohydrate and mineral

871
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,799
salts that's how it works I want to talk

872
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,320
about bulking for a minute bulking with

873
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,639
people who are weightlifting bulking

874
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,679
with people who are actually pushing

875
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,960
weights they're trying to get big

876
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:51,600
they're trying to get muscles all that

877
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,480
stuff I want to talk about that a little

878
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,720
bit what people find when they don't

879
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,960
have enough carbohydrates in their diet

880
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,880
what they find is a they can't bulk up

881
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,480
those M muscles as big as they want to

882
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,600
get them they can't get the muscles to

883
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,919
where they need to be they can't build

884
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,079
them like they want to so they end up

885
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,879
adding carbohydrates to their proteins

886
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:13,720
which is fat so they put fat and

887
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,520
carbohydrates together and they end up

888
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,639
building more muscle because they

889
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,119
brought carbohydrates in but they kept

890
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,839
the fats and because they kept the fats

891
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,720
they kept fat on their body so they bulk

892
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:28,359
up they end up with a layer of fat plus

893
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,919
more muscle and then they're in the

894
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:33,119
realm of how do we cut back how do we

895
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:35,200
cut back to somehow get the fat off of

896
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,679
us and try to keep the muscle it's a

897
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,280
game that doesn't work out that good

898
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,119
because now you're trying to cut back

899
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,280
now you're going it's a yo-yo you're

900
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,760
going back and forth on a yo-yo and

901
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,000
you're like trying to cut back on food

902
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,440
and cut back on carbs again but you

903
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,480
don't get rid of the protein and the fat

904
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,760
so you end up you end up getting stuck

905
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,159
where you get stuck with this little

906
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,480
excess weight on you and you're trying

907
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,880
to get rid of it but then you start

908
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,280
losing your muscle once you get rid of

909
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,599
carbohydrates again because

910
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,119
carbohydrates is the one thing that

911
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,640
builds muscle it's that and mineral

912
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:06,800
salts it's

913
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,359
carbohydrates and that's the whole point

914
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,920
but if these people just did carbs and

915
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,079
greens leafy greens lots of carbs

916
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,960
healthy carbs I'm talking about healthy

917
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,240
carbs like fruits and leafy greens and

918
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,599
celery juice if they did these things

919
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,599
all together you'd be able to build

920
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:28,240
bigger muscle and not get the fat layer

921
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,880
that's the whole thing and not get the

922
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,880
fat layer why do you think someone has

923
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,079
to use a carbohydrate to bulk up in

924
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,960
order to get more muscle why do you

925
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,800
think they need to bring that in because

926
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,560
when they're on just their lean meats

927
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,520
and their vegetables they can't get the

928
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,079
muscle they just can't get the muscle

929
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,960
they want so they have to bring in all

930
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,800
these carbs and it's called bulking and

931
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,640
you end up with a layer of fat on the

932
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,240
body and that layer of fat shows hey

933
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,960
what that layer of fat is it's from all

934
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,280
the protein and all the and all the

935
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,640
dense fat plus the carbohydrate combined

936
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:02,000
you can't put put those together leafy

937
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,599
greens contain Omega-3s naturally so

938
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,240
they're already in there if someone's

939
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,800
worried about Omega-3s and all the

940
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,240
omega-3 fatty acids they contain them

941
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,680
leafy greens have them butter leaf

942
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,280
lettuce red leaf lettuce they all have

943
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,319
it greens hold some of that that's

944
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,680
something right there that's

945
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:18,880
automatically in there so it's something

946
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,200
you know about barley grass juice powder

947
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,680
is a critical leafy green critical one I

948
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,200
like the vimergy barley grass juice

949
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,280

powder hands down I've ever come across

953
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,480
yet it's a mama poop company I love

954
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,640
those guys because they care about

955
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,000
people and when I use it I know it's

956
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,480
good and I know it's good and so that's

957
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,400
the kind of leafy green I really like a

how alizing it is it's all

992
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,800
incredible and then you know it's so

993
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:07,599
what matters is if you're into like even

994
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,920
if you're into exercising and you're not

995
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,720
just trying to recover from a chronic

996
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,560
illness and build some muscle you're

997
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,839
just you feel fine and you want to build

998
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,000
muscle you don't have to combine all

999
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:20,040
that fat with all those bad carbs to try

1000
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,680
to bulk up because that's what people do

1001
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,599
now you want the healthy

1002
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,119
carbohydrates you want the fruits you

1003
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,920
want the mangoes you want the papayas

1004
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,560
you want all that in there you want the

1005
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,800
oranges you want the apples you want the

1006
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,440
pears you want all that healthy fruit

1007
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,200
you want the the blueberries the wild

1008
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,480
blueberries and then you want to combine

1009
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,680
that with leafy greens and celery juice

1010
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,640
make sure that's in your program whether

1011
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,079
you're plant-based or your paleo or your

1012
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,720
animal protein and you're adding in the

1013
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,960
animal protein into your diet or if

1014
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,000
you're plant-based and you're adding in

1015
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,680
something else into your diet would it

1016
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,560
could be beans I see plant-based people

1017
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,280
on beans whatever it is that's what you

1018
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,680
want to do and that with your workout is

1019
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,839
how you start building some mustard

1020
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,079
muscles you know and unless you you know

1021
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,640
unless you've been through chronic

1022
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,319
illness been through Hellen Mac you got

1023
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,720
fatigue you got nerve pain and you're

1024
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,160
trying to get rid of the viruses through

1025
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,680
the medical medium information to clean

1026
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,200
those viruses out and you're trying to

1027
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,560
start to work out again for the first

1028
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,599
time in a long time then you take it

1029
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,760
easy and I'm going to do a whole show on

1030
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,280
that again about how all that works you

1031
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,880
can recover your muscles recover your

1032
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,920
bodies as you're healing from chronic

1033
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,800
illness so I'll do a whole show on that

1034
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,160
too and I'm also going to do a show on

1035
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,680
just in general muscle building

1036
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,079
bodybuilding in the future because it's

1037
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,079
never been my focus my focus is about

1038
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:32,400
saving lives offering life-saving

1039
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,160
information that's ahead of Science of

1040
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,040
research and chronic illness getting

1041
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,720
people recovered from the deaths of

1042
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,839
Despair that's always been my focus it's

1043
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,200
not about building a few muscles it's

1044
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:46,000
always been about recovering people so

1045
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,040
they can get to a point where they can

1046
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,800
work out and and because they can't

1047
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,240
because they're suffering and they're

1048
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,920
sick they got the lupus and the Ms and

1049
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,480
they got the hives breaking out the

1050
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,200
fatigue the anxiety severe depression

1051
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,440
body aches and pains their face hurt

1052
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,079
nerves teeth hurt they can't talk they

1053
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,319
can barely walk so the people have

1054
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,359
helped out recovering my whole life for

1055
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,040
decades so I never I never worried about

1056
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:11,920
the bodybuilding aspect of it because

1057
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,200
it's about saving lives not about

1058
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,720
getting somebody to look better for the

1059
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,359
beach that's never been my issue it's

1060
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,720
never been my goal to worry about that

1061
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,599
but I do help professional athletes I do

1062
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,920
help them to get better on their game

1063
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,800
all of that over the years absolutely

1064
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,440
and to build more muscle and get more

1065
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,839
agile more flexibility and all of that

1066
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,079
of course but the goal has always been

1067
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:34,480
people suffering struggling getting out

1068
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,040
of the depths of despair of the chronic

1069
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,599
illness finally getting answers for the

1070
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,280
first time ahead of science and research

1071
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,319
so they could rise above it helping out

1072
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,839
their family members all of that and

1073
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,520
that's what the books are about and

1074
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,599
that's what these shows are about leafy

1075
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,160
greens are a part of that so let's move

1076
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:50,760
on to the next part of leafy greens this

1077
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,560
is so great the 28 day cleanse in

1078
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,240
medical medium book one the 28 day

1079
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,920
cleanse I love that one powerful I've

1080
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,640
seen it bring lives back long before

1081
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,000
that book was published and the spinach

1082
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,760
soup in the 28 day cleanse and this is

00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:25,680
people people hate garlic it's all that

1121
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,720

sometimes you get an orange it's really

1131
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,200
bitey it's got a little little bit of an

1132
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,599
acidy flavor and it's too spritely but

1133
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,119
there's a lot of oranges they're sweet

1134
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,400

00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:18,359
acid oxalates oxyc acid spinach stay

1146
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,599

1147
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:22,760
fresh spinach there's nothing of that

1148
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:25,200
concern going on there at all it it's

1149
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,440
far from it it's when you cook spinach

1150
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,160
it's the opposite it see somebody

1151
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,599
flipped that a while back with

1152
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,520
misinformation years ago I don't know

1153
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,400
who did it or how they did it or how

1154
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,000
they accomplished it I don't know if it

1155
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,240
was on purpose by accident by default

1156
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,720
whatever but they flipped it they said

1157
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,319
cooking Your Spinach you know to get rid

1158
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,680
of the oxyc acid that's the only way you

1159
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:47,000
should eat that's that's the opposite

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,000
You Hinder the spinach you hurt the

1161
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,559
spinach you make the oxyc acid actually

1162
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,319
you destabilize it you know when it's

1163
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,920
when it's that but when it's in raw

1164

spinach it's in a form that's completely

1165
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,680
harmless it's not a it's not an issue

00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,839
with oxyc acid at all when it's raw and

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,480
leafy greens are important they can

1260
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,280
balance blood sugar work with the

1261
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,160
hormones these are just some of the

1262
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:57,480
things the leafy greens can do it's that

1263
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:01,079
powerful so the bottom line is if you

1264
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:03,599
got a guru that you go to and you got a

1265
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:05,079
book you love out there and if you're

1266
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,680
not getting enough leafy greens in the

1267
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:10,359
diet and celery juice that book's

1268
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,160
falling short and the guru is falling

1269
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:16,480
short not because the guru is not a good

1270
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,280
person it's not that at all I'm sure you

1271
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,839
know that Guru is a great person I'm

1272
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,960
sure that coach is a great person I'm

1273
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,440
sure that trainer is a great person I'm

1274
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,040
sure that trainer seems like they got it

1275
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,280
all down in the gym and they got some

1276
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,319
muscles they know all kinds of stuff

1277
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,480
about protein and what shakes to use and

1278
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,040
they and they know about you know

1279
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,920
different things and all that and and

1280
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,800
all of it I'm sure they're really good

1281
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,079
too with what they do absolutely I'm

1282
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,000
sure your best functional medicine

1283
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,720
doctor is good what he does I'm sure

1284
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,920
that book or pamphlet you picked up or

1285
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,040
something you found online or that

1286
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,599
website on online but if it doesn't have

1287
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,280
the celery juice it doesn't have the

1288
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:49,520
celery juice in the right amount so make

1289
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,799
sure you get the medical medium celery

1290
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,000
juice book so you know the right amounts

1291
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:54,599
of celery juice to use if you don't have

1292
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,960
the right amount of celery juice and the

1293
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,760
right amount of leafy greens and the

1294
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,640
different varieties of leafy greens in

1295
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,280
your diet on a daily basis no matter

1296
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:05,559
what you're doing you're missing the

1297
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:07,599
most important aspect of your health and

1298
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:10,480
your life your well-being and your

1299
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:13,319
recovery think about that so whatever

1300
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,559
you subscribe to whatever that might be

1301
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:17,880
whatever that is it's not going to be

1302
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:20,880
true it's not going to be true to who

1303
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,319
you are your physical needs your body

1304
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,040
your organs what your soul needs if the

1305
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:27,559
leafy greens and the seler juice aren't

1306
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,559
there bottom line that's it and if

1307
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:31,400
you're into the whole like ancestry

1308
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:33,119
thing where it's the Paleo and the old

1309
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,920
old cavemen and all that if you're into

1310
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,799
that whole thing where where all that

1311
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,040
that that fake science gets developed

1312
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:39,960
just like fake science in all the

1313
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,760
movements and everything from veganism

1314
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,200
to pism to all that where everybody's

1315
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,599
just throwing science at each other and

1316
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,079
hoping something sticks on the wall

1317
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:47,839
because they're hoping and they're just

1318
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,520
all digging for things whatever you

1319
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:52,760
believe in that you fell

1320
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:55,200
into okay just know that the world has

1321
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,920
changed the world has changed 10 years

1322
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:01,480
ago you guys the world has changed 15

1323
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:04,480
years ago we're more polluted now we're

1324
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,640
more hindered Now by pathogens that it

1325
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,720
basically mutated Epstein bar was

1326
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,599
nothing like it was when I was do when I

1327
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,040
was doing this back 20 years ago helping

1328
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:14,319
people 20 25 years ago the varieties of

1329
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,319
Epstein bar that were out there now

1330
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,480
compared to the ones that are being

1331
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:20,559
passed around now that people are

1332
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,200
Contracting nothing like it was we're up

1333
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,040
against toxic heavy metals like never

1334
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,760
before in history we're inundated with

1335
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,319
toxic heavy metals we're desperate to

1336
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,400
get the heavy metal detox smoothie for

1337
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,880
medical medium we're we're desperate to

1338
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,720
get that out of the body those Metals

1339
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,359
out of the body we're desperate to get

1340
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,119
those leafy greens and the barley grass

1341
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:40,119
juice powder in us every day we're

1342
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,319
desperate to get the celery juice in us

1343
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,280
every day to pull the stuff out so if we

1344
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,000
think about hey back in the old days

1345
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,880
back thousands of years ago you know uh

1346
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,319
men just picked a few berries and they

1347
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,079
hunted down some game and they ate a few

1348
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:56,200
mushrooms and that's what they needed

1349
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:59,319
you that that that does not apply

1350
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,319
it doesn't it doesn't apply at all we

1351
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:03,400
have so many different disorders that

1352
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:06,760
have developed that never existed ever

1353
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,720
in history before ever so many different

1354
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,599
diagnoses somebody can get so many

1355
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,839
non-diagnosis they can get with so much

1356
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,280
confusion with so many different

1357
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,799
problems and symptoms mystery chronic

1358
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,520
illness has turned into something unlike

1359
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:21,359
ever before in our history today and

1360
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,359
that's why we need the juices that's why

1361
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,079
juicing is critical if you're one of

1362
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,160
those that believes you know you have to

1363
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,000
have the fiber yeah who's who's taking

1364
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,040
your fiber away I'm telling you to eat

1365
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,359
leafy greens I'm telling you eat fruits

1366
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,160
and vegetables and leafy greens who's

1367
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:36,119
taking your fiber away because that's

1368
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,200
the only place we get fiber so pretty

1369
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,960
much the only place we get real fiber

1370
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,079
but the celery juice and juicing is

1371
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,040
critical because our bodies aren't even

1372
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,200
able to handle food so good they're so

1373
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,440
worn down internally our guts are such a

1374
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,799
mess we need the revitalization of the

1375
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,119
juices to revitalize to strengthen this

1376
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:56,720
so we can actually even handle fiber

1377
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,960
that's the whole point so we can even

1378
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,839
handle fiber to the degree that we need

1379
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,720
to handle it that's how important it is

1380
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,599
you can juice your leafy greens too I

1381
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,960
like doing two juices I like big big

1382
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,480
celery juice in the morning is what I

1383
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,040
like to do the end of the day I like to

1384
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,520
do a whole another juice where I add

1385
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,000
celery and then I add a few more things

1386
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,640
of course it stops the celery juice from

1387
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,359
working the celery itself but I add the

1388
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,240
leafy greens cucumbers I like the

1389
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,680
cucumber and leafy green juice that's

1390
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,520
what I like at the end of the day maybe

1391
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,640
a couple of stocks of celery in there

1392
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,839
it's not going to do what the celeries

1393
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,880
just did in the morning cuz by itself it

1394
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,839
has to be by itself to do the power it

1395
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,119
really has but I like separating like

1396
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,720
doing two

1397
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:36,880
juices but the point is it's juicing is

1398
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,559
important so you need to know that

1399
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,000
that's why I used my mega juicer and I

1400
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,200
just put it all through there and that's

1401
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,520
it it's the best one that ever that's

1402
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,599
ever been made out there but the bottom

1403
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:50,119
line is you guys have to make sure

1404
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,119
you're getting your leafy greens look I

1405
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:54,240
know this show is probably tough on a

1406
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:55,960
lot of a lot of people because you're

1407
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,920
hearing me say

1408
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,280
look no matter what you're subscribing

1409
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,240
to out there if you don't get enough

1410
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,559
leafy greens and the juices and the

1411
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:06,960
celery juice applied into it it's not

1412
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:09,400
going to be its best and I get it if I

1413
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,079
heard that if I was living my life and

1414
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,760
listening to the best doctor out there

1415
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:14,440
or the best book I read or whatever it

1416
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,760
is that's out there on stuff and I'm

1417
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,160
doing it and and all of a sudden I'm

1418
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,119
hearing this right now I'd probably be

1419
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:23,240
irritated too but just kick back sit

1420
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:25,680
back and realize I'm working for you I'm

1421
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,280
working for you you can just throw away

1422
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,839
you can throw what I'm doing away you

1423
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,160
can throw what I me working for you away

1424
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:34,359
you can push it aside you can forget

1425
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,520
about it may maybe it's wasted energy on

1426
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:38,000
my side then cuz you maybe you don't

1427
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,119
like that and you're just like I don't

1428
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
care if he's working for me who cares

1429
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:44,839
but I'm working for you no matter what

1430
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I'm there whether you like it or not I'm
