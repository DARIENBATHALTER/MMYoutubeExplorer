[0.00 - 3.16] marijuana about it it's going to be a
[1.56 - 4.72] big deal we're talking about a lot of
[3.16 - 7.44] stuff people don't know about marijuana

[7.44 - 13.56] that's right I called that shot first a
[9.68 - 15.20] long time ago it's documented and then
[13.56 - 17.60] they're starting to look into it seems

[17.60 - 21.76] metals what that's right so we're going
[20.32 - 23.60] to talk about what's up with that how
[21.76 - 25.52] that works what's going on we're going

[149.40 - 153.48] all that oil and all that grease but we
[152.12 - 155.04] got a lot to talk about first I want to
[153.48 - 158.48] give you an introduction I want to
[155.04 - 161.84] introduce you to my friends my friends
[158.48 - 164.84] right here you got fresh baby arugula
[161.84 - 166.52] beautiful herb you got cucumbers you got
[164.84 - 168.20] lemons if you could see those you got
[166.52 - 170.12] some green onions there some scallions
[168.20 - 172.48] you got lettuce is a lot of this stuff
[170.12 - 175.44] from the garden you got heirloom
[172.48 - 178.32] tomatoes now that I can get high on
[175.44 - 180.96] right there I can totally trip out on
[178.32 - 182.36] these right here with without a doubt
[180.96 - 183.96] your loom Tomatoes you guys know what
[182.36 - 186.12] they're like it's an experience beyond
[183.96 - 188.68] all other and I don't need to be high on
[186.12 - 190.88] weed to know that those are that good
[188.68 - 192.48] and then I got some mangoes here I got
[190.88 - 193.68] some red bell peppers over there I got
[192.48 - 195.44] some all kinds of different stuff from
[193.68 - 200.16] me some spices and everything else and
[195.44 - 202.40] some other things too and yeah got the
[200.16 - 206.52] food processor ready we're going to make
[202.40 - 209.16] pasta because pasta is how you make mac
[206.52 - 211.04] and cheese that's a big part of it you
[209.16 - 212.80] have I I think so I think that's what
[211.04 - 215.76] you got to do you got to make pasta in
[212.80 - 217.40] order to make mac and cheese right yes
[215.76 - 219.36] yes all right let's talk about the
[217.40 - 222.16] marijuana stuff let's get into it we
[219.36 - 224.96] might even do little demo stuff with my
[222.16 - 227.28] dummy right about how when weed goes
[224.96 - 231.16] into you and goes into your system
[227.28 - 232.24] what's going on okay and let's get into
[231.16 - 234.36] it
[232.24 - 238.16] so
[234.36 - 240.56] marijuana is toxic for a lot of reasons
[238.16 - 242.44] one of the big reasons is it's it's high
[240.56 - 246.40] in toxic heavy
[242.44 - 250.08] metals high in toxic heavy metals toxic
[246.40 - 253.92] Metals overall just high in it why is
[250.08 - 258.04] that how does it work for one weed
[253.92 - 262.12] growers marijuana growers they cut
[258.04 - 266.24] Corners they cut Corners all bets are
[262.12 - 268.40] off no regulations know anything I'm
[266.24 - 270.36] talking about some of the most
[268.40 - 274.08] respectable weed
[270.36 - 277.76] Growers out there in the world they cut
[274.08 - 280.48] Corners so they need their weed to grow
[277.76 - 282.88] they need the buds to be
[280.48 - 285.48] big they need their weed to grow and
[282.88 - 287.24] they need their buds to be big that's
[285.48 - 290.76] what they need in order to make those
[287.24 - 292.88] big buds they need
[290.76 - 295.64] fertilizer without
[292.88 - 298.32] fertilizer you don't get the big
[295.64 - 301.56] buds you need fertilizer for the big
[298.32 - 306.24] buds but Growers are
[301.56 - 309.08] cheap cheapos in the worst way that's
[306.24 - 311.52] notoriously how they are they don't want
[309.08 - 314.60] to spend the money on the good
[311.52 - 319.04] fertilizer and fertilizer is real priced
[314.60 - 321.08] up so right now weed is going to be even
[319.04 - 323.36] higher in toxic heavy metals in the
[321.08 - 326.04] coming next couple of years like we're
[323.36 - 328.16] talking like you smoke weed you're
[326.04 - 330.08] filling your tank with toxic heavy
[328.16 - 332.00] metals so let's get into the fertilizer
[330.08 - 334.48] thing what goes on with that first of
[332.00 - 335.76] all they need the cheap way out they
[334.48 - 337.72] don't want to buy
[335.76 - 339.72] fertilizers and they don't want to buy
[337.72 - 342.80] the resources to make their own
[339.72 - 343.96] fertilizers the good stuff they don't
[342.80 - 347.36] want to buy
[343.96 - 350.56] seaweeds they don't want you know
[347.36 - 353.96] manures from reputable
[350.56 - 358.80] places they get manures in massive boat
[353.96 - 362.20] loads from guess where you know it the
[358.80 - 366.00] industrial cow center of the world
[362.20 - 369.28] industrialized Cow Patties that's what
[366.00 - 371.04] they use and begin with just so you know
[369.28 - 373.32] industrialized cows are filled with
[371.04 - 375.08] drugs they're filled with antibiotics
[373.32 - 377.48] they're filled with all kinds of
[375.08 - 380.28] different Pharmaceuticals they're shot
[377.48 - 383.48] up left and right with antibiotics and
[380.28 - 386.20] pharmaceuticals and antifungals
[383.48 - 388.40] antifungal just for the record are
[386.20 - 390.16] really high in toxic heavy metals and
[388.40 - 394.12] other toxins and poison
[390.16 - 398.40] okay so the Manu that marijuana growers
[394.12 - 400.88] use are loaded with antifungal
[398.40 - 403.00] medications keep this in mind right here
[400.88 - 404.88] how this works that manure is also
[403.00 - 406.56] loaded in
[404.88 - 409.08] antibiotic
[406.56 - 411.52] medications these are just two another
[409.08 - 413.44] thing too is conventional cows get
[411.52 - 416.84] inflammation to the point where they
[413.44 - 419.52] swell so if you go to an industrialized
[416.84 - 421.44] you know uh ranch right they're kind
[419.52 - 423.48] they're all caged up they're all locked
[421.44 - 426.76] up you're talking about industrial meat
[423.48 - 429.56] right the real thing okay the cows are
[426.76 - 433.28] swollen their legs are swelling their
[429.56 - 435.68] organs are swelling they don't last long
[433.28 - 438.48] before they get butchered they can't
[435.68 - 440.80] hang long they get too sick organs are
[438.48 - 443.16] swelling so they pump them with
[440.80 - 445.56] anti-inflammatories so all that
[443.16 - 446.88] anti-inflammatory goes into the cow pad
[445.56 - 450.36] you guys get what I'm saying into the
[446.88 - 453.84] cow manure that's the cow manure weed
[450.36 - 456.68] grow weed growers actually use it's a c
[453.84 - 458.56] manure from the industrial center of the
[456.68 - 460.92] world of
[458.56 - 462.44] cows and then that manure right there
[460.92 - 463.96] filled with antifungals
[462.44 - 466.40] anti-inflammatories
[463.96 - 467.44] antibiotics and other medications and
[466.40 - 470.84] other
[467.44 - 472.40] Pharmaceuticals is in that manure and
[470.84 - 474.52] high in that manure the other thing is
[472.40 - 478.04] the feed right all the feed that's being
[474.52 - 480.56] used highly sprayed sprayed feed just
[478.04 - 485.16] for the record here this is critical to
[480.56 - 488.84] know that weed growers don't use
[485.16 - 491.80] organic like organic everything like no
[488.84 - 495.44] high like high quality highly reputable
[491.80 - 497.96] organic manur and fertilizers they don't
[495.44 - 499.72] do that they use the lowest of the
[497.96 - 501.28] lowest of the lowest they even concoct
[499.72 - 503.60] and make their own and we're going into
[501.28 - 507.88] that next part in a minute because you
[503.60 - 509.88] can't miss out on this some good stuff
[507.88 - 514.20] let's get into it a little bit
[509.88 - 517.36] so maners are a big part of how weed the
[514.20 - 520.96] buds are loaded with toxic heavy
[517.36 - 522.40] metals because of the antifungals and
[520.96 - 525.72] the antibiotics and the
[522.40 - 527.68] anti-inflammatories but that's just one
[525.72 - 531.12] place and then it's the feed for the
[527.68 - 534.32] cows that are laced in the pesticides
[531.12 - 535.72] and the rodenticides and everything else
[534.32 - 538.20] the weed killer and everything else
[535.72 - 540.00] that's in the grain that's fed to those
[538.20 - 541.32] cows
[540.00 - 544.04] and then the
[541.32 - 546.92] manure is highly toxic highly loaded
[544.04 - 549.76] with metals and that manure is
[546.92 - 551.72] purchased for very little money like
[549.76 - 554.68] dirt cheap and a lot of times weed
[551.72 - 558.48] growers make deals where they're
[554.68 - 561.40] actually bartering with weed for cow
[558.48 - 563.80] manure and they get the lowest grade
[561.40 - 566.20] bulk crap cow manure there is on the
[563.80 - 567.84] planet and they barter with weed for Cal
[566.20 - 570.60] manure that's a practice that does
[567.84 - 574.44] happen out there you might be saying not
[570.60 - 577.16] my weed grower not mine in my state not
[574.44 - 578.68] my you know whatever my weed grower
[577.16 - 580.44] never does that they tell me they got
[578.68 - 584.32] the best care for it they do this they
[580.44 - 586.60] do that but I'm sorry but I highly
[584.32 - 589.12] doubted it's highly unlikely maybe some
[586.60 - 591.48] Homespun weed grower somewhere some
[589.12 - 593.20] little Homespun weed weed grower that's
[591.48 - 595.12] actually growing some weed for
[593.20 - 598.44] themselves or something or trying to
[595.12 - 599.64] start up a business legally or whatever
[598.44 - 601.08] right
[599.64 - 602.40] and they're starting out and they want
[601.08 - 603.60] the best for the best for their plants
[602.40 - 604.96] but once you get into it for a little
[603.60 - 607.68] bit and you look at the bottom line and
[604.96 - 609.68] you're watching your Dollar Bottom uh-uh
[607.68 - 612.20] it all changes fast and then you hear
[609.68 - 614.52] about practices that the weed growers
[612.20 - 616.28] are doing the big weed growers are doing
[614.52 - 618.92] and those practice is are the only way
[616.28 - 623.16] to survive it's a big part of how the
[618.92 - 628.12] weed industry works so you get a bud bud
[623.16 - 629.72] looks great but it's toxic very toxic
[628.12 - 633.28] just go into something a little bit
[629.72 - 635.80] deeper on this people who smoke weed are
[633.28 - 637.76] already high and toxic heavy metals
[635.80 - 640.24] there's very few people who are smoking
[637.76 - 641.76] weed they have a need for weed if they
[640.24 - 644.56] have a need for weed they're high in
[641.76 - 646.64] toxic heavy metals because toxic heavy
[644.56 - 648.56] metals Mercury aluminum copper all of
[646.64 - 650.60] that lead everything that's inside our
[648.56 - 652.36] brains when we have too much of it
[650.60 - 654.80] patched out in different areas too much
[652.36 - 656.56] of it in different places in the brain
[654.80 - 658.64] what happens we start getting depression
[656.56 - 660.88] we start getting the depersonalization
[658.64 - 662.88] we start getting the anxiety attacks and
[660.88 - 664.44] you yes you can have pathogens involved
[662.88 - 666.16] pathogens love metals and you can have a
[664.44 - 669.04] combination of both but what I'm trying
[666.16 - 672.60] to tell you is is the bipolar the
[669.04 - 675.64] schizophrenia the depression the sadness
[672.60 - 678.88] the all of the above and
[675.64 - 681.20] more okay emotional not feeling good
[678.88 - 684.44] feeling bad not feel feeling unwell
[681.20 - 686.24] feeling sick in any way plus people who
[684.44 - 688.48] are suffering too in different ways not
[686.24 - 691.04] just emotionally and mentally but in
[688.48 - 693.08] physically and they smoke weed to try to
[691.04 - 694.96] curve everything curve the emotional
[693.08 - 697.52] pain curve the mental pain and physical
[694.96 - 699.44] pain to some degree they're high in
[697.52 - 702.16] toxic heavy metals people who smoke weed
[699.44 - 705.52] are already really high in toxic heavy
[702.16 - 707.80] metals so then they're smoking or using
[705.52 - 709.88] weed or eating weed or however you know
[707.80 - 712.48] some new way of taking weed comes into
[709.88 - 714.04] town whatever it is they're adding on to
[712.48 - 715.28] their heavy metals so the metals that
[714.04 - 717.20] they're getting from their weed is
[715.28 - 719.16] actually going into the metals is mixing
[717.20 - 721.36] into the metals that are in their brain
[719.16 - 723.00] and it's adding to it so they're smoking
[721.36 - 725.20] weed and it's kind of dumbing down their
[723.00 - 726.76] pain and sorrow and then the weed wears
[725.20 - 728.52] off and then boom they're back to square
[726.76 - 730.64] one you got to smoke the weed again
[728.52 - 732.40] dumbs down the pain and sorrow back to
[730.64 - 735.00] square one when it wears off boom you
[732.40 - 737.60] got to do it again dumbs down the pain
[735.00 - 739.20] and sorrow wears off boom you're back to
[737.60 - 740.80] doing it again right the Vicious Cycle
[739.20 - 742.68] of weed the Vicious Cycle of marijuana
[740.80 - 744.28] use it's you just and I'm not judging
[742.68 - 745.28] anybody on this at all that's not what
[744.28 - 748.72] this
[745.28 - 750.64] is that's not what this is at all right
[748.72 - 752.56] but you you have this thing where
[750.64 - 757.08] everybody goes up and down it becomes a
[752.56 - 759.12] vicious cycle and that vicious cycle is
[757.08 - 760.68] hard to break out of because people feel
[759.12 - 762.60] like they need the weed to calm things
[760.68 - 765.84] down emotionally what's happening
[762.60 - 767.32] instead is what they do not know is
[765.84 - 768.92] they're dealing with toxic heavy metals
[767.32 - 771.52] inside themselves in their liver in
[768.92 - 774.00] their brain in their body in their
[771.52 - 776.44] organs mostly in their brain creating a
[774.00 - 778.36] problem which leads them to a place
[776.44 - 780.32] where they want weed to begin with it
[778.36 - 782.40] leads them to to a place where hey I
[780.32 - 784.32] need to smoke
[782.40 - 786.00] marijuana but the problem here with
[784.32 - 787.24] marijuana is it's really high in toxic
[786.00 - 788.84] heavy metals and it's really high
[787.24 - 791.04] intoxic heavy metals adding to their
[788.84 - 793.80] problem slowly over time but adding to
[791.04 - 795.36] their problem slowly over time so let's
[793.80 - 798.28] get into fertilizer a little bit
[795.36 - 798.28] fertilizer might be
[798.92 - 804.60] a boring ass topic but when it comes
[802.36 - 809.68] down to weed it's not
[804.60 - 811.28] boring so what most weed growers do
[809.68 - 813.92] the we grower near
[811.28 - 816.44] you is they use their own urine to
[813.92 - 818.44] fertilize now before you B at the old
[816.44 - 821.32] your own urine to fertilize thing I'm
[818.44 - 823.40] not ripping that up totally back to the
[821.32 - 825.84] Landers have used
[823.40 - 827.72] urine for their
[825.84 - 830.44] fertilizer
[827.72 - 833.56] for dozens and dozens and dozens of
[830.44 - 836.68] years however you want to say it urine
[833.56 - 838.20] has been a fertilizer a staple for
[836.68 - 840.56] people who are trying to survive grow
[838.20 - 843.56] their own food food and they use
[840.56 - 847.24] urine to feed their food their growing
[843.56 - 849.96] food the nitrogen from their own
[847.24 - 854.72] urine can actually help support your
[849.96 - 855.76] garden now that's your own urine right
[854.72 - 858.64] that's
[855.76 - 860.92] yours the weeds you're
[858.64 - 861.96] smoking is a whole bunch of other
[860.92 - 865.04] people's
[861.96 - 867.12] urine people that you probably wouldn't
[865.04 - 869.20] want to ever meet
[867.12 - 871.96] someday probably the people that you
[869.20 - 874.60] would probably not want to run across
[871.96 - 877.96] someday they're uring so what they do is
[874.60 - 880.04] they contain it so in weed operations
[877.96 - 881.92] everybody who has to take a leak is not
[880.04 - 883.44] allowed to go take a leak on the edge of
[881.92 - 885.96] the the marijuana field they're not
[883.44 - 887.88] allowed to take a leak on the edge of
[885.96 - 891.04] the woods they're not allowed to use the
[887.88 - 893.28] bathroom when it comes down to
[891.04 - 895.76] urination so they can't just go into a
[893.28 - 899.00] bathroom and urinate most weed growers
[895.76 - 901.52] have a rule the rule is it's got to go
[899.00 - 904.72] into a vet or a jug it's got to be
[901.52 - 907.20] stored and everybody's urine gets stored
[904.72 - 908.84] for the weed growth
[907.20 - 912.04] process
[908.84 - 914.96] now sure you got your own little farm
[912.04 - 916.76] Farmstead Homestead you got your little
[914.96 - 918.40] you're back to the land you're growing
[916.76 - 921.56] your garden and you want to use your
[918.40 - 923.20] urine for your own plants you want to
[921.56 - 924.76] know how to use it you mix it with water
[923.20 - 927.60] you thin it out a little bit you got
[924.76 - 931.40] your your fertilizer you got your
[927.60 - 933.52] nitrogen I'm not ranking on that idea or
[931.40 - 934.72] that concept I understand it well and I
[933.52 - 937.00] know it
[934.72 - 942.36] well problem is with the weed rowing
[937.00 - 945.92] situation the industry is it's urine fed
[942.36 - 948.52] that's what it is now what I don't like
[945.92 - 952.92] about that for the weed industry is ur
[948.52 - 955.64] in fed from people that are highly
[952.92 - 957.80] toxic people that aren't eating good
[955.64 - 959.20] people that actually are in high in
[957.80 - 961.52] toxic heavy metals people that are
[959.20 - 964.08] drinking energy drinks out of cans all
[961.52 - 965.28] day while they're harvesting weed while
[964.08 - 966.56] they're growing the weed while they're
[965.28 - 968.48] nurturing their weed and they're
[966.56 - 970.20] drinking out of they're just drinking
[968.48 - 972.68] energy drinks out of aluminum cans and
[970.20 - 976.04] all kinds of toxins and everything
[972.68 - 977.80] else and even with all that they're
[976.04 - 979.52] exposed to Metals in so many other ways
[977.80 - 981.08] we can't even imagine I've taught about
[979.52 - 983.32] this for years toxic heavy metal
[981.08 - 984.84] exposure and how that
[983.32 - 990.04] works
[984.84 - 993.00] so the urine fertilizer that basically
[990.04 - 995.68] runs the gamma of the weed
[993.00 - 998.32] industry is highly toxic and filled with
[995.68 - 1000.24] toxic heavy metals it's not just filled
[998.32 - 1001.80] with some syphilis here and there it's
[1000.24 - 1003.44] not just filled with some Epstein bar
[1001.80 - 1005.20] here and there it's not just filled with
[1003.44 - 1007.56] a little gonorrhea it's not just filled
[1005.20 - 1009.76] with a little chyia it's not just filled
[1007.56 - 1011.88] with some shingles and it's not just
[1009.76 - 1014.28] filled with some strep it's not just
[1011.88 - 1017.28] filled with some staff or some some
[1014.28 - 1019.36] serious antibiotic resistant Mera and
[1017.28 - 1021.00] strep and Seed if it's not just filled
[1019.36 - 1022.64] with that that goes into those Vats
[1021.00 - 1025.64] because that's what the urine all has in
[1022.64 - 1027.84] it and that all goes into the ground
[1025.64 - 1030.92] there to grow your weed it's not just
[1027.84 - 1033.08] that it's filled with toxic heavy
[1030.92 - 1034.32] metals and so many other different
[1033.08 - 1036.28] toxins and
[1034.32 - 1040.28] poisons and so that's how the weed
[1036.28 - 1042.12] industry Works each Farm has their own
[1040.28 - 1045.08] dog Day
[1042.12 - 1046.80] rules you work there you learn pretty
[1045.08 - 1048.84] quick doesn't matter how kind of
[1046.80 - 1051.08] hippie-ish or kind of homegrown the
[1048.84 - 1053.44] people are how nice the people are they
[1051.08 - 1054.88] got their rules and a lot of their rules
[1053.44 - 1056.20] are is this is what we're going to use
[1054.88 - 1057.72] for fertilizer we're going to use the
[1056.20 - 1059.84] urine we're going to use the cheapest
[1057.72 - 1061.40] comve you've ever seen on this planet it
[1059.84 - 1063.28] doesn't matter grow those buds no one
[1061.40 - 1066.76] gives a freak it doesn't matter who
[1063.28 - 1068.96] smokes it whatever as long as that boom
[1066.76 - 1071.72] that content is there as long as that
[1068.96 - 1074.48] bud is powerful as long as that Gene of
[1071.72 - 1076.04] that plant is strong it doesn't matter
[1074.48 - 1077.96] it's where it's at so let's go into
[1076.04 - 1079.92] another realm of why toxic heavy metals
[1077.96 - 1082.60] are in in weed and I've been talking
[1079.92 - 1086.32] about this years versus anything else
[1082.60 - 1086.32] they can't use weed
[1086.40 - 1091.16] killer to dumb down the
[1089.20 - 1092.60] weeds I don't know if you guys get my
[1091.16 - 1096.08] drift on this at
[1092.60 - 1099.56] all they can't just take a weed killer
[1096.08 - 1102.44] and spray the field because even
[1099.56 - 1104.68] marijuana resistant weed killers
[1102.44 - 1107.68] or so forth where they don't kill
[1104.68 - 1109.60] marijuana still damage marijuana so they
[1107.68 - 1113.92] can't really so they have to rely on
[1109.60 - 1116.64] other means of keeping the weeds down
[1113.92 - 1118.80] and that means row covers so people
[1116.64 - 1122.16] don't realize is a lot of Road a lot of
[1118.80 - 1125.08] row covers are loaded with toxins
[1122.16 - 1127.20] poisons they're loaded with Metals
[1125.08 - 1129.24] they're loaded with plastics that are
[1127.20 - 1131.60] unstable so I got to tell you something
[1129.24 - 1133.28] about row covers row covers have a
[1131.60 - 1135.60] different form of plastic they have one
[1133.28 - 1139.64] where it's actually really unstable
[1135.60 - 1142.16] breaks down really fast and and so
[1139.64 - 1143.96] marijuana growers can't really keep the
[1142.16 - 1146.60] weeds under control underneath their
[1143.96 - 1149.20] marijuana plants because you can't kill
[1146.60 - 1151.48] those weeds with those weed killers cuz
[1149.20 - 1153.80] you're going to end up killing your weed
[1151.48 - 1156.36] and so they have to go with other means
[1153.80 - 1160.04] of dealing with and controlling their
[1156.36 - 1163.52] weed growth with their crops I know it's
[1160.04 - 1165.84] confusing I'm talking about weeds versus
[1163.52 - 1167.08] marijuana so the row covers go down
[1165.84 - 1170.84] that's one thing another thing is they
[1167.08 - 1173.44] use aluminum container ERS so we Growers
[1170.84 - 1175.16] most of the time use aluminum containers
[1173.44 - 1177.28] to Harbor their plants the roots of the
[1175.16 - 1179.12] plants go up against aluminum containers
[1177.28 - 1181.76] they're really high in
[1179.12 - 1184.64] aluminum it's another thing that happens
[1181.76 - 1187.08] too all these things matter when it
[1184.64 - 1188.96] comes down to farming and it's all part
[1187.08 - 1191.28] of why the toxic heavy metals are so
[1188.96 - 1194.32] high in weed and
[1191.28 - 1197.24] marijuana medical mum information called
[1194.32 - 1199.04] the shot first talked about it for
[1197.24 - 1202.28] years
[1199.04 - 1203.84] years about how weed is loaded with
[1202.28 - 1205.40] toxic heavy metals but nobody knew it
[1203.84 - 1207.76] and it was never tested just recently
[1205.40 - 1209.88] they started testing some weed and they
[1207.76 - 1212.52] found it's high in toxic heavy metals
[1209.88 - 1214.40] and everybody's got like a question mark
[1212.52 - 1217.08] above their head and they're like what
[1214.40 - 1220.76] how what
[1217.08 - 1222.48] why I wasn't testing it I wasn't
[1220.76 - 1224.64] starting a scientific study it comes
[1222.48 - 1226.04] with Spirit of compassion and constantly
[1224.64 - 1227.48] Spirit of compassion is proven right
[1226.04 - 1229.80] proven right proven right so many times
[1227.48 - 1233.44] to make your head been we have hundreds
[1229.80 - 1235.52] now hundreds documented of s so's
[1233.44 - 1238.16] information first and then someone
[1235.52 - 1240.24] taking the idea from s so like whoa it
[1238.16 - 1242.28] does have toxines let's what does have
[1240.24 - 1244.92] the metals Let's test weed now and see
[1242.28 - 1244.92] what it has in
[1245.24 - 1250.20] it so let's dig a little deeper into
[1248.40 - 1252.40] weed for a second but let's just do a
[1250.20 - 1253.84] little check right here on what we have
[1252.40 - 1256.84] going
[1253.84 - 1256.84] on
[1257.12 - 1262.36] so another thing too is there there the
[1260.44 - 1264.88] whole thing it's not just about testing
[1262.36 - 1266.80] weed it's going to be
[1264.88 - 1268.72] testing it's not going to be about
[1266.80 - 1273.56] testing weed it's going to be about
[1268.72 - 1273.56] testing other things too like
[1274.52 - 1278.68] people so that's the next thing like why
[1277.00 - 1281.08] are people who smoke weed higher in
[1278.68 - 1282.44] toxic heavy metals why is that happening
[1281.08 - 1283.56] what's going on they're going to put two
[1282.44 - 1286.00] and two together and they're still not
[1283.56 - 1288.56] going to know why until they hear this
[1286.00 - 1291.00] live so when someone hears this
[1288.56 - 1293.36] live or here's a video that I put out
[1291.00 - 1294.80] with this information on it or however
[1293.36 - 1296.28] they're going to start testing people
[1294.80 - 1298.68] and start testing people and as they're
[1296.28 - 1298.68] testing
[1298.92 - 1304.28] people they're going to find they in
[1301.88 - 1307.32] their high in toxic heavy
[1304.28 - 1309.12] metals so yeah interesting all on its
[1307.32 - 1310.72] own all right so I just want to talk
[1309.12 - 1313.24] about what we're making real quick you
[1310.72 - 1314.96] guys just got on here we're making baked
[1313.24 - 1318.20] mac and cheese we're having a really
[1314.96 - 1319.60] good talk as well now there's no no
[1318.20 - 1322.08] judgment on anybody who smokes weed
[1319.60 - 1325.44] there's no judgment on anybody who
[1322.08 - 1328.24] actually um smokes
[1325.44 - 1329.68] marijuana but we're making some baked
[1328.24 - 1331.68] mac and cheese in a little bit we're
[1329.68 - 1334.20] making a salad as well I think I might
[1331.68 - 1335.76] start heading there as we speak or we're
[1334.20 - 1337.44] going to cover a little bit more
[1335.76 - 1339.52] information on
[1337.44 - 1341.44] this so if you want to grow your own
[1339.52 - 1344.44] chickens in the backyard and you want
[1341.44 - 1348.12] your chickens like really
[1344.44 - 1349.64] pure really clean really organic you got
[1348.12 - 1351.12] your chickens out there free-ranging it
[1349.64 - 1353.16] and they're picking out bugs and they're
[1351.12 - 1355.28] picking out things in the grass right
[1353.16 - 1356.60] they're picking at things in the pen you
[1355.28 - 1358.60] let them go if you got a little bit of
[1356.60 - 1360.44] land and you let you let those chickens
[1358.60 - 1363.28] roll those chickens will be picking off
[1360.44 - 1365.12] stuff left and right right they're
[1363.28 - 1367.56] getting this incredible diet of wild
[1365.12 - 1369.36] food so your chickens your free range
[1367.56 - 1370.48] chickens are actually getting all that
[1369.36 - 1374.00] wild
[1370.48 - 1375.92] food that's what's going on so when you
[1374.00 - 1377.72] go and you go eat your chicken you're
[1375.92 - 1379.20] like well I know the food I fed my
[1377.72 - 1382.64] chicken chicken the problem is like with
[1379.20 - 1384.40] weed it's not like organic farming and
[1382.64 - 1385.76] even that can get questionable sometimes
[1384.40 - 1388.16] but it's not like organic farming when
[1385.76 - 1390.36] you got organic lettuce or you got
[1388.16 - 1393.12] organic food that you just purchased
[1390.36 - 1395.76] there's regulations that are really
[1393.12 - 1397.56] strict with that even though there's
[1395.76 - 1398.92] still fine lines and nuances and
[1397.56 - 1400.92] everything else but there's still a lot
[1398.92 - 1403.00] of strictness to
[1400.92 - 1405.56] that so but when it comes down to the
[1403.00 - 1409.36] whole weed thing it really doesn't work
[1405.56 - 1411.80] like that so you can't take a group
[1409.36 - 1415.48] group of every group of people that
[1411.80 - 1418.48] work at a weed farm you can't Coral them
[1415.48 - 1420.36] up in a pen and make them eat organic
[1418.48 - 1422.44] food only make them eat this make them
[1420.36 - 1423.36] eat that make them do this you know
[1422.44 - 1424.68] they're not allowed to take any
[1423.36 - 1426.60] Pharmaceuticals they're not allowed to
[1424.68 - 1429.48] do this you can't Corral a whole ton of
[1426.60 - 1432.00] people you can't go around the country
[1429.48 - 1434.40] and around the world round up all the
[1432.00 - 1436.84] farmers that grow weed and all their
[1434.40 - 1438.40] workers and tell them that they're just
[1436.84 - 1440.00] going to be going out in that field and
[1438.40 - 1442.16] they're just going to be picking away at
[1440.00 - 1443.68] Wild foods and wild bugs and they're
[1442.16 - 1447.08] going to have this diet that's super
[1443.68 - 1449.36] clean and no Pharmaceuticals and no and
[1447.08 - 1451.64] no energy drinks or whatever else you
[1449.36 - 1454.16] can't do that to
[1451.64 - 1455.52] people so then all their urine that's
[1454.16 - 1459.24] going into the
[1455.52 - 1461.96] fertilizers are not like monitored that
[1459.24 - 1464.32] urine is not monitored so when you go
[1461.96 - 1466.88] and you consume that weed or eat it or
[1464.32 - 1469.00] smoke it or whatever there was really
[1466.88 - 1471.20] nothing there
[1469.00 - 1472.72] to create a boundary of protection
[1471.20 - 1474.04] instead you know when you got your own
[1472.72 - 1475.24] chickens you know what you're feeding
[1474.04 - 1477.04] your
[1475.24 - 1478.52] chickens you don't want to go to
[1477.04 - 1481.00] somebody else's house and they kill a
[1478.52 - 1482.56] chicken in their backyard and they tell
[1481.00 - 1485.12] you well here's what we feed our
[1482.56 - 1486.64] chickens guess what we feed our chickens
[1485.12 - 1488.28] we feed our chickens a whole bunch of
[1486.64 - 1489.60] crap like a whole bunch of toxic stuff
[1488.28 - 1491.32] and everything else here you are eating
[1489.60 - 1493.64] their chicken and you're just like uh I
[1491.32 - 1496.68] don't want to eat this
[1493.64 - 1498.44] chicken I want a chicken in a controlled
[1496.68 - 1502.28] enough environment where that chicken is
[1498.44 - 1505.36] actually eating wild bugs eating seeds
[1502.28 - 1508.60] eating anything else it can find in that
[1505.36 - 1510.60] dirt that keeps it healthy that keeps it
[1508.60 - 1512.12] pure at its purest form there's always
[1510.60 - 1513.84] going to be tox heavy metals everywhere
[1512.12 - 1515.52] they fall out of the sky but even beyond
[1513.84 - 1519.32] that I'm just saying the cleanest you
[1515.52 - 1522.96] can get with what this Earth
[1519.32 - 1527.20] offers with what's happening with this
[1522.96 - 1531.08] Earth so this isn't like an insult to
[1527.20 - 1533.32] people who use weed medicinally
[1531.08 - 1534.84] medically where they use it because they
[1533.32 - 1536.88] feel like they need it they use it for
[1534.84 - 1539.68] things they need it's not about that at
[1536.88 - 1543.04] all this is just
[1539.68 - 1544.92] about the mere understanding of how it
[1543.04 - 1546.80] goes what's going on and maybe this talk
[1544.92 - 1548.44] changes the system over time and maybe
[1546.80 - 1550.56] down the road people who are actually
[1548.44 - 1552.64] consuming weed will consume weed that's
[1550.56 - 1554.44] not high in toxic heavy metals and how
[1552.64 - 1557.12] about that wouldn't that be
[1554.44 - 1559.20] great and maybe we actually have care
[1557.12 - 1560.76] about it if people really believe in
[1559.20 - 1563.36] their weed and use their weed they
[1560.76 - 1566.96] actually the system can change a little
[1563.36 - 1568.72] bit as it goes along where that stuff is
[1566.96 - 1570.96] clean already there's people out there
[1568.72 - 1572.60] like it's the miracle it's the miracle
[1570.96 - 1574.04] medicine weed's the miracle medicine
[1572.60 - 1576.88] it's the greatest stuff there is there's
[1574.04 - 1578.56] nothing better than that it can fix
[1576.88 - 1579.76] anything it can cure anything we cure
[1578.56 - 1581.40] anything you know the people say that
[1579.76 - 1583.92] stuff they say that stuff all the time
[1581.40 - 1585.84] and they do that whole thing CBD CBD
[1583.92 - 1587.72] weed weed weed CBD weed whatever and
[1585.84 - 1589.44] everybody's just freaking out like no
[1587.72 - 1590.84] it's the miracle hemp hemp hemp it's the
[1589.44 - 1594.12] miracle
[1590.84 - 1596.96] medicines meanwhile it's loaded with
[1594.12 - 1598.52] toxic stuff highly toxic which adds to
[1596.96 - 1600.20] the problem to begin with of why
[1598.52 - 1603.08] somebody's even suffering to begin with
[1600.20 - 1605.76] so it's almost like what how does that
[1603.08 - 1607.56] work so maybe the system will change
[1605.76 - 1609.92] someday they're already taking an
[1607.56 - 1611.92] interest in looking into weed having
[1609.92 - 1614.36] toxic heavy metals because of mm info
[1611.92 - 1615.96] now they're going to be looking into how
[1614.36 - 1618.04] people are you know are they highend
[1615.96 - 1619.52] metals that actually smoke weed and and
[1618.04 - 1620.84] they're going to start and maybe down
[1619.52 - 1624.44] the road they're going to start looking
[1620.84 - 1626.16] at growing practices and find out really
[1624.44 - 1628.48] why everything's so cheap skated
[1626.16 - 1631.12] everything's so Cheapo and then to the
[1628.48 - 1633.88] point where people are just dumping
[1631.12 - 1635.48] their own urine into the crops because
[1633.88 - 1637.40] they're just trying to create a bud no
[1635.48 - 1639.64] matter what high water or hell and it
[1637.40 - 1641.00] gets done and that's it so let's start
[1639.64 - 1643.40] making some
[1641.00 - 1645.76] food and there's plenty more to talk
[1643.40 - 1648.16] about talk about weed than that plenty
[1645.76 - 1650.64] more about how it's not good for the
[1648.16 - 1652.80] brain actually it's actually bad for the
[1650.64 - 1655.44] brain something that's very important to
[1652.80 - 1658.80] know I'm going to drop some pasta in
[1655.44 - 1662.48] here if you guys don't
[1658.80 - 1665.20] mind so this is 3 lbs I'm probably going
[1662.48 - 1667.40] to just leave a half a pound out maybe
[1665.20 - 1669.80] I'll do
[1667.40 - 1672.88] that me I might be able to do all three
[1669.80 - 1672.88] pounds in here let's take a
[1674.08 - 1678.28] look there we
[1676.08 - 1681.28] go I'm going to add a little bit more
[1678.28 - 1683.12] for it there you don't want to overcook
[1681.28 - 1684.60] your pasta when you're doing this so
[1683.12 - 1687.44] keep that in mind you don't want to
[1684.60 - 1690.12] overcook your pasta that's one thing
[1687.44 - 1691.48] that's really really important because
[1690.12 - 1693.08] if you overcook your pasta then you're
[1691.48 - 1694.76] going to have just kind of like mush
[1693.08 - 1697.08] it's not going to be firm it's not going
[1694.76 - 1699.00] to hold itself up and that is going to
[1697.08 - 1702.40] be a problem all on its own so kind of
[1699.00 - 1702.40] just a reminder for people who
[1702.64 - 1708.08] actually I mean but unless you like your
[1704.96 - 1710.20] pasta mushy and and if that's the case
[1708.08 - 1714.00] that's awesome totally awesome if you
[1710.20 - 1717.24] want to do that why not a lot of
[1714.00 - 1719.40] people a lot of people um like their
[1717.24 - 1721.56] pasta overdone
[1719.40 - 1724.20] overcooked this is going to cook fast
[1721.56 - 1725.60] I'm going to remind myself every couple
[1724.20 - 1728.48] of minutes I'm just going to double
[1725.60 - 1730.92] check let's get that
[1728.48 - 1734.12] going
[1730.92 - 1734.12] okay all
[1734.28 - 1739.24] right now I know when you talk negative
[1736.64 - 1741.92] in any way any way with marijuana you
[1739.24 - 1743.48] just get like hit like it's like people
[1741.92 - 1745.68] just get so upset they're highly
[1743.48 - 1747.04] protected they're like pites they're
[1745.68 - 1750.36] like Watchdogs over it and they're
[1747.04 - 1753.04] highly protected protective over it but
[1750.36 - 1754.84] by no means is this an insult towards it
[1753.04 - 1756.56] it's just information that I think that
[1754.84 - 1759.08] everybody should know I mean I think
[1756.56 - 1761.72] it's everybody's right to
[1759.08 - 1762.88] know yeah a question right there what
[1761.72 - 1764.88] kind of pasta are you using check out
[1762.88 - 1766.68] medical me.com go to my
[1764.88 - 1769.32] directory and you'll see what kind of
[1766.68 - 1769.32] pasta I'm using
[1771.28 - 1774.16] I mean we're going to make some killer
[1772.48 - 1776.28] mac and
[1774.16 - 1778.16] cheese so what I'm going to do is make
[1776.28 - 1780.36] some cheese sauce if you guys are okay
[1778.16 - 1780.36] with
[1781.72 - 1787.04] that I'm just going to get a couple of
[1783.92 - 1787.04] potatoes out if you don't
[1789.76 - 1799.32] mind these potatoes are really really
[1793.52 - 1799.32] hot right here I'm going to move this
[1799.76 - 1805.44] okay I'm going to get the skins off of
[1802.12 - 1808.84] here too now these are already
[1805.44 - 1811.00] steamed they're already
[1808.84 - 1815.88] preheated these are
[1811.00 - 1818.68] warm the oven's preheated the 400 right
[1815.88 - 1821.84] now let's go find a nice spot here there
[1818.68 - 1823.48] we are look at that how much room we
[1821.84 - 1825.76] have today on The Cutting Board let's
[1823.48 - 1827.32] just go here now I take the skin off the
[1825.76 - 1829.60] potato because you don't want the skin
[1827.32 - 1832.00] on there because you're making your this
[1829.60 - 1835.16] is the base of your cheese sauce and you
[1832.00 - 1835.16] guys know I just made this pretty
[1835.40 - 1840.72] recently okay so that's one I just
[1838.04 - 1843.04] peeled out peeled back let's see another
[1840.72 - 1843.04] one
[1845.44 - 1850.48] here yep and I'm just taking the skin
[1849.08 - 1852.52] off of course you can leave the skin but
[1850.48 - 1854.08] you might have a different color cheese
[1852.52 - 1857.32] in the end you you want to have that
[1854.08 - 1858.72] authentic looking Cheese look let's
[1857.32 - 1860.96] check this pasta cuz I don't want this
[1858.72 - 1863.56] biting me in the
[1860.96 - 1867.32] butt cuz that pasta will
[1863.56 - 1868.80] cook no joke I already pre preheated the
[1867.32 - 1871.52] oven at
[1868.80 - 1873.64] 400 okay so let's take the skins off of
[1871.52 - 1873.64] this
[1873.68 - 1878.96] one there you go and I might put one
[1876.36 - 1880.72] more potato there Karen Spence says is
[1878.96 - 1883.72] there a reason to take the skin off
[1880.72 - 1886.00] after cooking and not
[1883.72 - 1888.44] before well I know when you're taking
[1886.00 - 1891.44] the skin off before you can do that you
[1888.44 - 1894.24] can totally do it but then you might get
[1891.44 - 1897.36] kind of a tougher outside the skin kind
[1894.24 - 1899.24] of becomes the the place where the skin
[1897.36 - 1903.20] becomes the protective sheath that get
[1899.24 - 1906.88] takes the heat becomes kind of
[1903.20 - 1908.88] like um beat up from it now I got this
[1906.88 - 1912.24] just is all going to be kind of creamed
[1908.88 - 1914.52] up easy in the food processor so that's
[1912.24 - 1916.24] kind of why I do it if you skin it first
[1914.52 - 1917.72] and you cook the potatoes the outside of
[1916.24 - 1920.40] the potatoes that you cook cook you get
[1917.72 - 1922.56] a little tougher and now this is all
[1920.40 - 1925.08] just right there to that that part I'm
[1922.56 - 1928.52] going to get one more
[1925.08 - 1931.60] potato just in case I got one with a
[1928.52 - 1931.60] little piece missing right
[1931.76 - 1936.88] here yep so I want to talk about
[1935.40 - 1939.72] marijuana a little bit more if you guys
[1936.88 - 1941.64] are open to it I want to go into an area
[1939.72 - 1945.68] where I actually was starting to go into
[1941.64 - 1948.52] and I kind of got derailed a little bit
[1945.68 - 1950.76] so Mar lot of plants get a lot of fungus
[1948.52 - 1953.36] they get a white they get a white fungus
[1950.76 - 1953.36] is what they
[1953.72 - 1960.80] get so they use a lot of
[1958.12 - 1963.52] fungicides on marijuana to try to get
[1960.80 - 1966.04] rid of this white fungus so the plants
[1963.52 - 1967.96] turn white and when they start turning
[1966.04 - 1970.36] white they get a white film going all
[1967.96 - 1972.16] the way up the trunk of the plant all
[1970.36 - 1973.76] the way on the stems it eventually can
[1972.16 - 1976.36] get to the buds
[1973.76 - 1979.64] too and this is a big problem for
[1976.36 - 1981.60] Growers out there and so what they use
[1979.64 - 1984.20] is they use a lot of
[1981.60 - 1985.72] fungicides on their plants now this is
[1984.20 - 1988.12] going to be a decent amount of cheese
[1985.72 - 1988.12] here for
[1989.08 - 1994.68] sure they get a lot of pests too and see
[1992.28 - 1998.60] what they do for pest control with
[1994.68 - 2001.92] marijuana is they use outdated they they
[1998.60 - 2005.68] there's auctions out there for outdated
[2001.92 - 2007.96] pesticide in aerosol cans so the kind
[2005.68 - 2010.28] one you go to the store whatever store
[2007.96 - 2012.64] you go to hardware store whatever Big
[2010.28 - 2015.32] Box store you go in there and what
[2012.64 - 2015.32] happens is
[2017.56 - 2024.28] that they sell aerosol cans that are Bug
[2020.72 - 2029.96] Killers it's like kill spiders kill kill
[2024.28 - 2032.88] ants ant killer right wasp killer right
[2029.96 - 2035.56] let's make sure this doesn't get
[2032.88 - 2038.96] overcooked no still got a couple more
[2035.56 - 2038.96] M nice
[2042.60 - 2045.76] wo all
[2045.80 - 2050.32] right I might make two batches of cheese
[2048.44 - 2053.68] real
[2050.32 - 2055.96] quick we'll see so I'm going to take
[2053.68 - 2059.00] some carrots that I steamed earlier I'm
[2055.96 - 2060.32] over here you guys see the carrots here
[2059.00 - 2062.40] they're going to go in here now I don't
[2060.32 - 2065.08] like putting so many carrots in here
[2062.40 - 2065.08] where you got so
[2065.88 - 2068.88] many
[2070.36 - 2074.20] I'll show you guys like this right I
[2072.64 - 2077.08] don't like putting so many carrots in
[2074.20 - 2079.48] here where it's tastes like carrot
[2077.08 - 2082.20] cheese if you keep the carrots down a
[2079.48 - 2084.44] little bit it won't taste like carrot
[2082.20 - 2085.72] cheese it'll taste like cheese it's
[2084.44 - 2087.32] crazy when you put all the spices and
[2085.72 - 2089.16] everything else in
[2087.32 - 2092.76] there all
[2089.16 - 2092.76] right I'm going with
[2095.88 - 2098.88] this
[2101.80 - 2105.20] let's see if I can get this in
[2108.84 - 2113.04] here all right you guys this is going to
[2110.80 - 2116.60] get a little crazy just bear with
[2113.04 - 2116.60] me kind of
[2118.48 - 2125.56] uh kind of run it around over
[2122.56 - 2128.92] here I want to get to the bug killer
[2125.56 - 2131.92] stuff that's what I want to do want to
[2128.92 - 2131.92] get to the bug killer
[2133.60 - 2136.76] things all
[2137.44 - 2143.72] right let's go you know how the medical
[2140.68 - 2143.72] medium cooking show
[2143.84 - 2147.60] rolls sometimes it goes real smooth and
[2146.48 - 2150.44] sometimes it could be like a little bit
[2147.60 - 2150.44] of a [ __ ] show
[2152.28 - 2155.52] right all
[2155.80 - 2159.88] right feeling good about that that's the
[2158.60 - 2161.52] pasta right there let's get this cheese
[2159.88 - 2167.20] cooking right now I don't want this
[2161.52 - 2167.20] pasta like drying up in there all
[2167.72 - 2173.16] right let's
[2170.72 - 2176.88] go all right guys that's my pasta I'm
[2173.16 - 2179.60] going to move move this over a little
[2176.88 - 2182.36] bit so what Growers like to do is they
[2179.60 - 2187.28] like to buy outdated auctioned
[2182.36 - 2190.80] 10-year-old aerosol cans of bug killer
[2187.28 - 2192.80] and then the workers at weed Farms take
[2190.80 - 2195.08] the can and they just spray it directly
[2192.80 - 2197.96] on the plant it's not M it's not like
[2195.08 - 2201.00] regulated it's not like you know diluted
[2197.96 - 2201.00] there's nothing like that going
[2203.84 - 2209.20] on
[2205.88 - 2211.40] and and so basically what's happening is
[2209.20 - 2213.92] people are smoking weed with the blood
[2211.40 - 2213.92] of that going
[2215.68 - 2218.68] on
[2226.28 - 2230.16] we're making the cheese right now but I
[2227.64 - 2230.16] got to add the
[2235.36 - 2241.60] spices I'm
[2238.16 - 2241.60] nervous why am I

[2404.96 - 2409.12] you don't overcook it if you overcook
[2409.72 - 2414.00] it it'll all start sticking together
[2412.12 - 2415.72] because you're not adding oil this is a
[2414.00 - 2417.16] fat-free dish you're not adding oil
[2415.72 - 2419.64] where's all the oil you're not going to
[2417.16 - 2422.92] have oil that's the whole point this is
[2419.64 - 2425.92] a mac and cheese that doesn't kill your
[2422.92 - 2427.44] pancreas I mean how how incredible is
[2425.92 - 2430.24] that
[2427.44 - 2432.60] I'm going to mix this cheese up with it
[2430.24 - 2432.60] take a
[2433.40 - 2438.12] look you guys looking at this let's hope
[2436.28 - 2439.84] we're not so overloaded that I'm in
[2438.12 - 2443.04] trouble in this bow
[2439.84 - 2445.88] size actually getting
[2443.04 - 2450.44] nervous
[2445.88 - 2450.44] yeah let's hope that that's
[2453.64 - 2458.28] okay now let's mix this up see what I'm
[2457.12 - 2461.04] doing you
[2458.28 - 2463.08] guys so this is going to go in the oven
[2461.04 - 2465.96] in a minute take a look does that look
[2463.08 - 2467.56] insane that looks
[2465.96 - 2471.32] insane
[2467.56 - 2474.20] aw I think you did
[2471.32 - 2476.56] it all
[2474.20 - 2480.16] right
[2476.56 - 2482.48] so I mean if if you got a bunch of pot
[2480.16 - 2484.48] heads at your home we don't have Poe
[2482.48 - 2486.12] heads here but I'm just saying if I know
[2484.48 - 2487.88] that people do a lot if you got a bunch
[2486.12 - 2490.36] of potheads at your home man and you
[2487.88 - 2492.64] make this do you think they'll actually
[2490.36 - 2492.64] eat
[2494.92 - 2500.88] it or you think they're just going to
[2497.40 - 2504.92] order some crazy pizza at some like
[2500.88 - 2504.92] really greasy Pizza
[2506.80 - 2512.04] chain or most likely somebody's
[2509.04 - 2512.04] urinating in the dough
[2513.00 - 2518.44] anyway I don't know about that
[2516.88 - 2520.76] all
[2518.44 - 2523.20] right just you hear stories you hear
[2520.76 - 2527.56] stories over the years okay so I'm just
[2523.20 - 2527.56] mixing this up take a look you guys like
[2529.16 - 2532.80] it I just want to get that cheese in
[2531.44 - 2534.44] there as good as possible I'm going to
[2532.80 - 2536.72] add a little bit more cheese I hope you
[2534.44 - 2540.08] guys are okay with this but but there's
[2536.72 - 2543.20] still some left and I'm kind of like
[2540.08 - 2545.16] partial to this tastes so good check
[2543.20 - 2548.16] this
[2545.16 - 2548.16] out
[2549.24 - 2551.64] there we
[2553.68 - 2558.16] go look at
[2555.92 - 2560.48] that I think that actually really does
[2558.16 - 2562.40] it now you'll see here it's not o like
[2560.48 - 2563.72] there's not I didn't use so many carrots
[2562.40 - 2565.92] don't get me wrong you like carrots you
[2563.72 - 2568.12] can do more carrots but I didn't use so
[2565.92 - 2570.84] many carrots that it's like a you know
[2568.12 - 2573.16] like a more of a darker orange cheese I
[2570.84 - 2574.96] like it like this you can't taste the
[2573.16 - 2578.16] carrots I love carrots but you can't
[2574.96 - 2578.16] taste them
[2579.88 - 2583.96] okay so the key is you want to mix it
[2582.08 - 2586.96] pretty good and I'm I'm saying this
[2583.96 - 2589.56] because you don't want an
[2586.96 - 2591.12] unhappy person who's eating in your
[2589.56 - 2593.44] house and you don't want somebody that's
[2591.12 - 2595.12] unhappy because they got a little
[2593.44 - 2598.12] section there that doesn't have a lot of
[2595.12 - 2599.80] cheese in it you don't want anybody
[2598.12 - 2602.40] like
[2599.80 - 2604.28] complaining you want everybody happy I
[2602.40 - 2608.44] think that's getting pretty good let's
[2604.28 - 2610.00] let's pan it man let's pan
[2608.44 - 2612.84] it
[2610.00 - 2616.00] yeah I think we can pan that
[2612.84 - 2619.76] baby boom let's take a
[2616.00 - 2621.40] look I have a pan here you know I'm just
[2619.76 - 2623.08] trying something different and's going
[2621.40 - 2625.68] to bite me in the ass but I put a little
[2623.08 - 2626.40] parchment paper on the bottom you don't

[2753.00 - 2760.52] goes let's do it oven's on oven's hot
[2758.24 - 2763.64] I'm not putting anything on the
[2760.52 - 2766.00] top let me put my aluminum foil on the
[2763.64 - 2767.92] top no I'm not no aluminum foil talking
[2766.00 - 2771.00] about toxic metals and and and
[2767.92 - 2773.40] everything and PC Rivera says the sauce
[2771.00 - 2775.64] looks so much like cheese only it's not
[2773.40 - 2777.64] and it's healthy not only that here's
[2775.64 - 2780.08] the real screwed up piece about it all
[2777.64 - 2783.64] like here's what's really crazy about it
[2780.08 - 2786.48] right it tastes like cheese it tastes
[2783.64 - 2788.84] like cheese I didn't put salt in this
[2786.48 - 2790.80] one you want to put a little bit of salt
[2788.84 - 2793.20] in yours put a little bit of salt in
[2790.80 - 2794.28] yours right and then you got that salty
[2793.20 - 2796.88] cheese
[2794.28 - 2798.60] flavor unlocking Infinity says what
[2796.88 - 2800.96] about marijuana's effect on the
[2798.60 - 2804.28] emotional body because I have seen huge
[2800.96 - 2807.04] benefits not with constant use but
[2804.28 - 2809.36] occasionally with subtle energy Fields
[2807.04 - 2812.64] doesn't seem cut and
[2809.36 - 2814.32] dry so you see what you're saying right
[2812.64 - 2816.16] um look everybody that smokes weed that
[2814.32 - 2817.28] loves to smoke weed they'll they'll
[2816.16 - 2818.60] they'll say the same thing they're not
[2817.28 - 2821.44] going to say it's bad like it's it's
[2818.60 - 2824.20] hurting them I mean there should if they
[2821.44 - 2826.40] try weed and they like weed and it feels
[2824.20 - 2828.04] good and they like to do that they're
[2826.40 - 2829.20] going to continue to do that ask them
[2828.04 - 2830.32] ask them how it's working for them
[2829.20 - 2832.24] they'll tell you how great it's working
[2830.32 - 2833.52] for them like I said I told this story
[2832.24 - 2835.12] over time and I hope my friend doesn't
[2833.52 - 2837.36] kill me
[2835.12 - 2841.32] but you know my friend is still sitting
[2837.36 - 2845.16] on his couch smoking weed
[2841.32 - 2847.72] and he's he's up there in age and uh his
[2845.16 - 2847.72] wife left
[2847.84 - 2851.96] left them years ago and she couldn't
[2850.20 - 2853.44] take it anymore right great guy
[2851.96 - 2856.00] incredible guy
[2853.44 - 2857.72] but you know she first got into the
[2856.00 - 2859.96] relationship and she was smoking weed
[2857.72 - 2861.16] with him and they were both weed smokers
[2859.96 - 2863.84] and they were happy and they were
[2861.16 - 2866.76] smoking and then eventually she was like
[2863.84 - 2868.64] I can't do this anymore no matter how it
[2866.76 - 2870.76] makes me feel or how I can't do this
[2868.64 - 2874.64] anymore and she felt like it was time
[2870.76 - 2877.52] for her to um leave the weed smoking
[2874.64 - 2879.76] world and so so when she did that he was
[2877.52 - 2881.52] really upset and he didn't want to
[2879.76 - 2883.12] change for her so he didn't want to
[2881.52 - 2885.04] change he was like no I'm not going to
[2883.12 - 2886.72] change for you we've been married all
[2885.04 - 2888.56] these years and I don't want to change
[2886.72 - 2890.36] for you and so that's what he told her
[2888.56 - 2893.20] over and over again for years she quit
[2890.36 - 2895.36] smoking weed and then and then she had
[2893.20 - 2897.20] to smell it every day in the house and
[2895.36 - 2899.88] she had to smell it in the living room
[2897.20 - 2902.32] and she really kind of got to a place
[2899.88 - 2903.80] where she was like just one morning he
[2902.32 - 2907.36] woke
[2903.80 - 2910.88] up and there was a in the kitchen and it
[2907.36 - 2912.64] said I have to leave I'm gone and he was
[2910.88 - 2914.44] like what and instead of him pulling his
[2912.64 - 2915.92] crap together and like and really
[2914.44 - 2918.08] working it out with her and be like all
[2915.92 - 2920.48] right I'll back down on my weed smoking
[2918.08 - 2921.88] I'll try to like I'll try to you know do
[2920.48 - 2925.24] I'll try to work with you on this
[2921.88 - 2928.72] instead of that it just he just didn't
[2925.24 - 2931.40] didn't pursue and it's really sad treia
[2928.72 - 2935.28] said that's what broke up my last
[2931.40 - 2937.84] relationship on YouTube right there um
[2935.28 - 2940.68] this is just it it happens it happens
[2937.84 - 2943.60] really difficult for a lot of people and
[2940.68 - 2946.16] my ex became addicted it was constant
[2943.60 - 2948.84] every day so much so he changed his
[2946.16 - 2950.72] attitude his priorities I could not
[2948.84 - 2953.04] stand it I could not stand it exactly
[2950.72 - 2954.92] and so I've seen this happen to a friend
[2953.04 - 2956.40] and you know friend's a good guy and
[2954.92 - 2958.36] everything but that's what he does it's
[2956.40 - 2961.12] just it happens Jor
[2958.36 - 2963.00] said weed gave me a panic attack never
[2961.12 - 2965.12] worked for my symptoms a lot of people
[2963.00 - 2966.40] say this so many people there's two
[2965.12 - 2967.60] kinds of people in the world there's
[2966.40 - 2970.68] people that smoke
[2967.60 - 2973.76] weed and there's people that tried weed
[2970.68 - 2973.76] and it gave them panic
[2974.44 - 2978.52] attacks that's a big one right there so
[2977.00 - 2980.80] many people that tried weed and it gave
[2978.52 - 2983.04] them panic attacks it made them not feel
[2980.80 - 2984.56] good in so many ways it's like either
[2983.04 - 2986.32] weed two kind of people in the world
[2984.56 - 2988.96] people that like weed people that
[2986.32 - 2991.04] don't right that's pretty much what it
[2988.96 - 2994.04] is in the end if you really kind of
[2991.04 - 2996.44] break it down as far as weed goes but by
[2994.04 - 2999.60] no means is this like
[2996.44 - 3001.64] you know bashing weed smokers or
[2999.60 - 3004.88] anything like that it would
[3001.64 - 3008.80] never ever do that
[3004.88 - 3011.24] because you know I know how life works
[3008.80 - 3013.60] it's called A Hard freaking world we
[3011.24 - 3016.12] live in and there's a reason why someone
[3013.60 - 3017.76] started smoking it it's a reason why it
[3016.12 - 3019.56] took on a habit it's a reason why it
[3017.76 - 3020.92] took on addiction it's a reason why
[3019.56 - 3022.00] they're trapped in it there's a reason
[3020.92 - 3024.12] why they're doing it and there's a
[3022.00 - 3026.16] reason why there are thousands and
[3024.12 - 3028.68] thousands and thousands of people
[3026.16 - 3031.24] homeless on
[3028.68 - 3033.68] drugs everywhere right now all over the
[3031.24 - 3035.20] streets or wherever and it's it's crazy
[3033.68 - 3036.84] like and I'm not saying we did that
[3035.20 - 3039.32] that's not at all what I'm saying I'm
[3036.84 - 3041.20] not ignorant like that or I'm not like
[3039.32 - 3045.20] naive or anything like that that's not
[3041.20 - 3047.40] how it works I'm just saying though that
[3045.20 - 3048.88] it it's gotten a lot of people and
[3047.40 - 3050.64] there's people that say I can control it
[3048.88 - 3052.88] I can control it I can control it like I
[3050.64 - 3054.72] got it under control I do just parties
[3052.88 - 3056.00] weekends and all that I respect that
[3054.72 - 3058.64] whatever
[3056.00 - 3060.44] and I'm not against anybody who's even
[3058.64 - 3062.04] doing it but here's what I always say
[3060.44 - 3063.40] whatever Vice you have or whatever
[3062.04 - 3065.76] you're using that you feel is helping
[3063.40 - 3069.40] you medically or however it is and I'm
[3065.76 - 3071.40] not not dissing the whole medical
[3069.40 - 3075.20] marijuana thing people you use it for
[3071.40 - 3077.40] pain relief no way am I dissing that at
[3075.20 - 3079.00] all like I said there's so many people
[3077.40 - 3081.08] that use it for so many reasons it's
[3079.00 - 3083.16] really hard it's hard and there
[3081.08 - 3085.48] situations are really difficult I'm just
[3083.16 - 3087.16] saying that you might be somebody that's
[3085.48 - 3089.24] like whoo I didn't know about this and
[3087.16 - 3090.76] maybe I can do this and maybe there is
[3089.24 - 3093.96] some maybe I can get the metals out of
[3090.76 - 3096.08] my brain instead so I don't need weed
[3093.96 - 3099.12] people say that they test weed for toxic
[3096.08 - 3102.64] heavy metals before it's sold people say
[3099.12 - 3106.00] that all the time uh
[3102.64 - 3107.64] sure sure sure sure and people saying
[3106.00 - 3110.16] there's organic weed and it's free of
[3107.64 - 3112.80] toxic heavy metals just like tat two ink
[3110.16 - 3116.88] is free of toxic heavy metals heard that
[3112.80 - 3121.44] over and over again and my tattoo to
[3116.88 - 3122.96] Salon we use ink that is metal free
[3121.44 - 3125.48] heard that over and over again over
[3122.96 - 3129.08] again but that's not true that's not
[3125.48 - 3131.32] reality that's not how it works okay
[3129.08 - 3133.52] keep that in mind right there it's very
[3131.32 - 3135.44] important to know tattoo ink is loaded
[3133.52 - 3136.88] with metals because that's how you get
[3135.44 - 3139.04] the pop remember how I always told you
[3136.88 - 3141.04] guys I tell you guys all the time that's
[3139.04 - 3142.64] mm info by the way out there once again
[3141.04 - 3144.68] now they're talking about it like wait a
[3142.64 - 3147.56] minute did you know vegan ink and has
[3144.68 - 3151.00] Metals in it you know it came from mm
[3147.56 - 3154.00] info but in medical medum books and
[3151.00 - 3156.88] everything but the point is is that yeah
[3154.00 - 3159.60] sure you know my organic weed you know
[3156.88 - 3163.84] grower you know whatever there's nothing
[3159.60 - 3168.36] toxic in here it's all clean uh-uh uh-uh
[3163.84 - 3171.12] no way no way in fact it's the opposite
[3168.36 - 3173.44] in fact they're testing weed now in fact
[3171.12 - 3176.00] they're actually finding its high in
[3173.44 - 3178.20] metals in fact it's going to probably
[3176.00 - 3181.20] change the way weed growing works out
[3178.20 - 3183.72] there because people are on to it now
[3181.20 - 3185.56] because of mm info but they're on to it
[3183.72 - 3189.12] and so it's going to change as time goes
[3185.56 - 3190.76] on and like I said before the people who
[3189.12 - 3192.44] actually are farming and using it are
[3190.76 - 3194.48] still not going to stop their practices
[3192.44 - 3195.40] their practices are like grow the
[3194.48 - 3199.00] biggest
[3195.40 - 3201.60] bud makeshift your fertilizer use your
[3199.00 - 3204.08] aerosol canned bug spray that's the
[3201.60 - 3206.00] rules that's how it works people always
[3204.08 - 3208.44] ask if they're
[3206.00 - 3210.72] urinating and cucumbers and other
[3208.44 - 3213.64] produce no they're not they're not using
[3210.72 - 3215.60] they're not using urine in the process
[3213.64 - 3217.68] of organic farming I'm talking about
[3215.60 - 3219.84] people use urine for their own backyard
[3217.68 - 3222.52] growing their own little farm that
[3219.84 - 3224.72] they're doing their own garden people
[3222.52 - 3227.56] use their own urine they store the urine
[3224.72 - 3229.36] they mix it with water they find a ratio
[3227.56 - 3231.00] some even test it a little bit test
[3229.36 - 3233.12] their own urine to try to find ratios
[3231.00 - 3234.72] for nitrogen that's really difficult
[3233.12 - 3236.20] really that's not really what they do
[3234.72 - 3237.36] but some people are trying to do that
[3236.20 - 3239.04] really what happens is they're just
[3237.36 - 3240.52] mixing urine with water and they're just
[3239.04 - 3242.84] trying to find the right batch and then
[3240.52 - 3245.20] they go and spread it on their
[3242.84 - 3246.72] Garden but with organic farming and the
[3245.20 - 3250.68] organic produce and everything like that
[3246.72 - 3254.04] you're not getting human urine as your
[3250.68 - 3255.08] fertilizer for that so it doesn't work
[3254.04 - 3258.00] like that I'm going to make a salad
[3255.08 - 3260.24] circuit and working on that um if the
[3258.00 - 3262.20] worker pees once in a while on produce
[3260.24 - 3263.96] field that's much different than what
[3262.20 - 3266.00] we're talking about here so if you got
[3263.96 - 3269.08] an organic farm and worker runs off to
[3266.00 - 3270.52] the edge of the field and pees somewhere
[3269.08 - 3273.04] that that's not what we're talking about
[3270.52 - 3276.16] here so if you're if you just got on
[3273.04 - 3276.16] here watch this whole thing for the
[3276.96 - 3279.96] beginning
[3281.64 - 3286.28] yep let's start making a salad we're
[3284.00 - 3287.52] still talking about weed and marijuana
[3286.28 - 3289.88] something else is going to come to mind
[3287.52 - 3292.32] too I did want to finish those thoughts
[3289.88 - 3293.52] though about like spraying down the
[3292.32 - 3296.36] plants they spray them down with the
[3293.52 - 3299.56] aerosol cans as I was saying before but
[3296.36 - 3301.08] you have to know that um there isn't
[3299.56 - 3302.76] it's not like there's all these rules
[3301.08 - 3305.00] big rules and regulations with weed
[3302.76 - 3307.12] growing even states that are completely
[3305.00 - 3308.80] open to it it's not like somebody's
[3307.12 - 3310.72] coming in inspectors are coming in every
[3308.80 - 3312.36] minute and they're like you can't use
[3310.72 - 3313.96] this you can't use that you can't do
[3312.36 - 3316.28] this you can't do that they they don't
[3313.96 - 3321.68] have that going on yet it's pretty wild
[3316.28 - 3325.08] west and another thing too is the fields
[3321.68 - 3328.16] the very few Growers that are at
[3325.08 - 3331.92] adhering to anything that doesn't
[3328.16 - 3335.52] constitute the rest of the 95 97% of all
[3331.92 - 3337.52] the other Growers including for sure all
[3335.52 - 3340.32] the other growers in different countries
[3337.52 - 3342.08] so that's a whole another level too of
[3340.32 - 3344.56] understanding there no regulations to
[3342.08 - 3347.32] anything the stuff is high in toxic
[3344.56 - 3351.04] stuff stuff is high in plastic stuff is
[3347.32 - 3352.16] high in metals it's high in it's high in
[3351.04 - 3355.32] actually
[3352.16 - 3356.84] everything um that you don't want
[3355.32 - 3358.48] dioxins is a whole another one all on
[3356.84 - 3360.44] its own let's let's start making a salad
[3358.48 - 3362.88] we'll cover some
[3360.44 - 3365.04] more why does weed give so many people
[3362.88 - 3368.12] panic attacks and anxiety it's toxic to
[3365.04 - 3369.72] the brain I talk about like a lot of the
[3368.12 - 3371.32] brain obviously in the brains saer books
[3369.72 - 3375.04] there's a Brain saer book right there
[3371.32 - 3375.04] here's the brain saver protocols right
[3378.44 - 3382.40] here I'm going to do a whole show on
[3380.76 - 3383.72] like weed what it does to the brain and
[3382.40 - 3386.52] everything else too so I'm going to go
[3383.72 - 3388.24] into that
[3386.52 - 3390.48] just having a coffee right now to try to
[3388.24 - 3393.04] keep myself awake so I'm doing this you

[3396.36 - 3400.36] drink
[3398.20 - 3403.00] coffee I don't like
[3400.36 - 3407.48] caffeine I know too much about
[3403.00 - 3409.48] it and this isn't apple cider vinegar
[3407.48 - 3410.92] this is apple cider so I'm drinking

[3638.96 - 3643.12] this I would say one of the biggest
[3641.20 - 3646.72] reasons
[3643.12 - 3649.96] why why weed is so toxic with Metals one
[3646.72 - 3652.80] of the biggest reasons is probably the
[3649.96 - 3652.80] canned bug
[3652.88 - 3657.04] spray used Direct ly on the
[3658.20 - 3662.12] plants I'm going to do another heirloom

[3689.20 - 3694.12] can do what you want Bo McGee this is
[3691.92 - 3697.08] hard to watch because I know it is true
[3694.12 - 3699.56] and my fiance thinks he can stop but
[3697.08 - 3702.32] won't try to give him celery juice and
[3699.56 - 3705.12] brain shots and offer compassion but
[3702.32 - 3707.44] it's but it's very hard yeah it's very
[3705.12 - 3709.40] hard it's very hard it is it is it's
[3707.44 - 3714.44] hard
[3709.40 - 3716.80] um yeah it's not an easy thing to do and
[3714.44 - 3718.24] I'm trying to make a happy show here I'm
[3716.80 - 3720.76] trying to make a happy
[3718.24 - 3723.68] show
[3720.76 - 3727.16] right I'm trying not to be a downer you
[3723.68 - 3730.32] know like right I'm not trying to be but
[3727.16 - 3734.12] seriously it's it's pretty bad stuff out
[3730.32 - 3734.12] there it's pretty bad
[3735.84 - 3740.08] stuff you guys this is really cool I got
[3738.52 - 3742.12] the salad right here you can see it
[3740.08 - 3745.40] partially and I'm going to even try to
[3742.12 - 3747.80] get this tomato in the right there can
[3745.40 - 3751.96] you see that yeah it's pretty
[3747.80 - 3753.56] cool no yeah no all right let's get a
[3751.96 - 3755.32] few more tomatoes on here you want
[3753.56 - 3757.92] tomatoes in your Sal so when you mix it
[3755.32 - 3759.08] up you want it to look nice and tomatoey
[3757.92 - 3760.60] I'm just going to get a couple of these
[3759.08 - 3763.12] pieces in here all right let's get it
[3760.60 - 3763.12] cucumber
[3765.40 - 3771.92] skinned all right and let's
[3769.36 - 3774.44] get some of this tomato juice off of
[3771.92 - 3776.36] here you want to you want to actually
[3774.44 - 3779.32] avoid cutting yourself so easily make
[3776.36 - 3781.68] sure your board is dry all that tomato
[3779.32 - 3785.04] juice makes things slippery and when
[3781.68 - 3786.40] things get slippery your whatever slides
[3785.04 - 3787.64] out from underneath you and then you're
[3786.40 - 3790.76] in
[3787.64 - 3792.04] trouble all right I take the skin off
[3790.76 - 3794.40] you see that skin right there you know
[3792.04 - 3796.12] what's on that skin I don't care if it's
[3794.40 - 3797.56] organic I don't care if it's the most
[3796.12 - 3799.04] organic unless it's in your backyard
[3797.56 - 3801.84] unless you raise it yourself unless you
[3799.04 - 3803.36] Gro yourself even if it's organic farm
[3801.84 - 3806.44] like organic farm cucumbers they're
[3803.36 - 3809.60] sprayed with wax and MSG and nicotine
[3806.44 - 3812.68] and caffeine all on the outside of the
[3809.60 - 3814.84] um of the Cucumbers but if you and I'm
[3812.68 - 3819.20] getting all that off that's why I take
[3814.84 - 3819.20] the green off of the Cucumber you
[3820.16 - 3824.68] guys would the world change if everybody
[3822.56 - 3826.20] who smoked weed just smoked cucumbers
[3824.68 - 3828.76] would that change
[3826.20 - 3830.00] anything dry dehydrated cucumbers and
[3828.76 - 3832.56] they just smoke
[3830.00 - 3834.08] that now it's not just cucumber they do
[3832.56 - 3837.04] that but cucumber's a big one they do
[3834.08 - 3839.36] that with it's but that's not just
[3837.04 - 3842.12] cucumber but cucumber's a big one right
[3839.36 - 3844.84] there so I got most of that off feeling
[3842.12 - 3844.84] pretty good about
[3846.00 - 3850.72] that all
[3848.48 - 3852.36] right but I'm just talking about organic
[3850.72 - 3855.72] produce in general you know how it's
[3852.36 - 3857.64] organic produce is sprayed with waxes
[3855.72 - 3860.96] and all that filming stuff conventional
[3857.64 - 3862.68] produce too but but we still we need our
[3860.96 - 3864.52] organic produce we need our produce
[3862.68 - 3866.76] whether it's conventional we need to eat
[3864.52 - 3867.96] are you know herbs and wild foods and
[3866.76 - 3869.60] fruits and vegetables and everything
[3867.96 - 3871.72] else and leafy greens we have to eat
[3869.60 - 3873.32] those so I'm just saying that one of the
[3871.72 - 3875.24] things you do is with cucumbers unless
[3873.32 - 3877.08] you grow them in your own backyard you
[3875.24 - 3878.48] just want to peel the skin off if you
[3877.08 - 3879.80] don't peel the skin off you eat it that
[3878.48 - 3881.84] way so be it it's not the end of the
[3879.80 - 3883.12] world I'm just saying that you do want
[3881.84 - 3885.72] to do that now I'm going to cut this in
[3883.12 - 3889.20] half and make like half cucumber
[3885.72 - 3890.92] slices from what the recipe kind of
[3889.20 - 3894.20] calls for
[3890.92 - 3895.60] here all right so I'm going to do is I'm
[3894.20 - 3897.64] going to knock some of these down like
[3895.60 - 3899.52] this you don't want them too thick oh
[3897.64 - 3901.56] wait you might want them thick you can
[3899.52 - 3904.16] put them on your salad any way you like
[3901.56 - 3905.80] I'm putting them a little bit thinner so
[3904.16 - 3907.24] that you're not like stuck eating a huge
[3905.80 - 3910.32] piece of cucumber while you're trying to
[3907.24 - 3910.32] enjoy your salad so
[3913.08 - 3916.96] the let's check that mac and
[3917.24 - 3922.44] cheese dang that mac and cheese is just
[3919.64 - 3926.08] about done that ain't no joke that stuff
[3922.44 - 3926.08] is just about done
[3927.28 - 3931.68] just about
[3929.60 - 3933.72] done another thing too you know when
[3931.68 - 3935.88] they use those aerosol bug spray cans
[3933.72 - 3937.92] for all the crops for all the marijuana
[3935.88 - 3939.24] crops you know as the workers are doing
[3937.92 - 3941.20] it the workers are breathing it in
[3939.24 - 3942.84] they're not hating suiting themselves
[3941.20 - 3944.04] and they don't they're not wearing masks
[3942.84 - 3945.04] they're just breathing it all in and
[3944.04 - 3947.88] then they
[3945.04 - 3949.40] urinate afterwards with all that bug
[3947.88 - 3951.08] spray in their bloodstream and they
[3949.40 - 3952.52] create urine that's even higher in toxic
[3951.08 - 3953.76] heavy metals and all kinds of different
[3952.52 - 3955.40] pesticides and they use that as
[3953.76 - 3957.36] fertilizer wizer it's just it's like a
[3955.40 - 3961.16] vicious cycle it just goes on and it
[3957.36 - 3961.16] goes on and goes on how crazy is
[3962.52 - 3967.40] that and in the end I know nobody really
