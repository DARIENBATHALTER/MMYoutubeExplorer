[173.36 - 181.48] in look at
[175.96 - 183.64] this I'm making a decent amount so
[181.48 - 185.40] you don't want to overcook it it's easy
[183.64 - 187.36] to do if you're not paying attention if
[185.40 - 190.56] you got something going on it's easy to
[187.36 - 193.36] overcook keep that in mind right there
[190.56 - 197.08] real easy to overcook like blink your
[193.36 - 200.32] eyes and your pasta is shot it's just
[197.08 - 203.12] gone right close your eyes for a minute
[200.32 - 206.40] and then your pasta just dissolves so
[203.12 - 210.08] keep that in mind always like be on

[1607.40 - 1612.96] but check this out right the toilets at
[1610.56 - 1616.72] the event let's get into the a little
[1612.96 - 1619.24] bit so the reason why they were first
[1616.72 - 1621.56] class like
[1619.24 - 1623.96] billionaire you know
[1621.56 - 1627.36] toilets the reason why there were
[1623.96 - 1629.00] toilets that you know like the top
[1627.36 - 1631.04] billionaires on the planet probably
[1629.00 - 1632.60] would use that an event and then again I
[1631.04 - 1634.32] have no idea what they would use like
[1632.60 - 1637.44] that if they would the reason why they
[1634.32 - 1639.32] were that amazing is because I was
[1637.44 - 1640.76] concerned because we're talking about
[1639.32 - 1643.12] chronic illness we're talking about the
[1640.76 - 1644.80] people in the medical medium community
[1643.12 - 1647.16] and do I want the people in the medical
[1644.80 - 1649.08] medum community stuffed in those tiny
[1647.16 - 1652.28] little cheap pieces
[1649.08 - 1655.56] portons do you think I want like the mm
[1652.28 - 1658.88] Community stuffed in these little tiny
[1655.56 - 1664.84] chemical bound highly toxic
[1658.88 - 1666.68] chemical crap like dirty nasty portons
[1664.84 - 1669.08] right that everybody uses in all the
[1666.68 - 1670.60] events including burning man you think
[1669.08 - 1674.28] with Burning Man the amount of money
[1670.60 - 1676.92] people pay to go and do that Burning Man
[1674.28 - 1678.84] thing you think like to get tickets you
[1676.92 - 1681.04] think they would put a better bathroom
[1678.84 - 1684.00] in burning man no they have people going
[1681.04 - 1685.28] a bathroom in the field in the mud
[1684.00 - 1686.96] that's where they're going to bathroom
[1685.28 - 1690.52] over there right they're going to the
[1686.96 - 1692.48] bathroom in buckets so so basically what
[1690.52 - 1695.68] I'm trying to say here is instead of
[1692.48 - 1698.84] using those really just those little
[1695.68 - 1701.20] portons that are stinky and they're
[1698.84 - 1702.40] toxic as hell and I got a lot of people
[1701.20 - 1703.68] in the medical meme Community have
[1702.40 - 1705.52] nervous system issues that they're
[1703.68 - 1709.24] healing from all that
[1705.52 - 1712.88] stuff you think I want them you
[1709.24 - 1714.52] guys think I want everybody breathing in
[1712.88 - 1717.32] highly toxic
[1714.52 - 1719.44] chemical soups that are in those tiny
[1717.32 - 1720.96] little portons and you're bumping into
[1719.44 - 1723.20] the walls and you're banging your head
[1720.96 - 1726.00] in there and you're dropping crap in the
[1723.20 - 1727.60] seat down into the toilet no didn't want
[1726.00 - 1729.32] to do it I wanted to make sure they were
[1727.60 - 1733.96] Top Dog
[1729.32 - 1736.48] topnotch big time topnotch and so I
[1733.96 - 1739.00] wanted to make sure you guys had the
[1736.48 - 1741.88] right kind see the right

[1765.88 - 1770.56] make sure that seriously there was like
[1768.28 - 1772.24] really high quality top tier bathrooms
[1770.56 - 1774.92] for the medical medum community for a
[1772.24 - 1776.76] billion reasons because I worry about
[1774.92 - 1779.12] the people in the community your health
[1776.76 - 1781.60] and wellness I mean how can you do like
[1779.12 - 1783.44] something like this and just cram

[1816.44 - 1822.40] many of you were it was really
[1818.80 - 1824.56] incredible in so many ways what did you
[1822.40 - 1827.48] would tell me you guys were you there
[1824.56 - 1829.44] for the light blast did you get hit by
[1827.48 - 1830.96] the Light BL bl by S so's light blast
[1829.44 - 1834.04] that's what I want to ask you were you
[1830.96 - 1837.60] there because that light blast expanded
[1834.04 - 1840.72] beyond the park and it went literally
[1837.60 - 1842.64] beyond the park ass said it was a very
[1840.72 - 1846.44] strong one there were multiple ones they
[1842.64 - 1848.60] went beyond the park it hit the lines I
[1846.44 - 1852.40] talked to somebody that was in the line
[1848.60 - 1855.12] since 7:00 a.m. 7 in the morning okay
[1852.40 - 1858.68] and she told me that she was hit by the
[1855.12 - 1860.64] Light blast in the line and she wasn't
[1858.68 - 1862.80] even in the park she was hit by the
[1860.64 - 1867.36] Light blast okay so let me move some
[1862.80 - 1869.44] stuff over and make some room here um
[1867.36 - 1871.40] you needed to attend next time I hope
[1869.44 - 1873.88] you do I really hope you do going to
[1871.40 - 1876.24] move these carrots
[1873.88 - 1879.52] over okay you guys I got the baked mac
[1876.24 - 1882.88] cheese going there and I
[1879.52 - 1885.04] am sure that's off let's start making
[1882.88 - 1887.04] the salad here look at these leafy
[1885.04 - 1889.68] greens I have right here it's a green
[1887.04 - 1891.72] leaf lettuce love green leaf lettuce
[1889.68 - 1895.64] love the taste of green leaf lettuce I
[1891.72 - 1895.64] love the crunch I love it better than
[1895.96 - 1899.88] Roma hands down if you can actually
[1898.32 - 1901.56] choose if you have a choice if you have
[1899.88 - 1904.00] the ability to choose between Romanian
[1901.56 - 1907.96] and a green
[1904.00 - 1911.04] leaf always go with the green leaf okay
[1907.96 - 1913.80] romain's good for you it's a good
[1911.04 - 1916.08] lettuce but it doesn't have what green
[1913.80 - 1919.16] leaf has it's a stronger lettuce meaning
[1916.08 - 1921.88] it's better for you the melage
[1919.16 - 1924.60] okay mucilage in that
[1921.88 - 1926.48] stem is a lot more medicinal and that's
[1924.60 - 1930.88] important too so the medicine is in the
[1926.48 - 1932.20] stem right there the base of it right
[1930.88 - 1933.68] there's a lot of medicine in there so
[1932.20 - 1935.44] it's not just in the greens with all the
[1933.68 - 1938.68] vitamins and the
[1935.44 - 1939.80] nutrients and the phy chemical compounds
[1938.68 - 1941.88] and
[1939.80 - 1944.60] everything right here in the green leaf
[1941.88 - 1947.92] lettuce is that melage right there okay
[1944.60 - 1950.32] and you see it the milk that milk more
[1947.92 - 1951.76] more intense more medicinal so I like it
[1950.32 - 1953.48] better than the Roma lettuce for that
[1951.76 - 1955.28] reason so I just want to share that
[1953.48 - 1959.20] there's so many things I can share and I
[1955.28 - 1963.24] just never go to chance never get a
[1959.20 - 1966.12] chance lightheart mama says I saw Tex
[1963.24 - 1968.80] post a video of the
[1966.12 - 1972.84] bathrooms I've never seen such nice
[1968.80 - 1975.16] bathrooms for an event like that yeah no

[1981.56 - 1987.96] very delighted about the bathrooms as

[2407.84 - 2411.00] of
[2408.84 - 2413.04] that but there's a lot of stuff out
[2411.00 - 2417.08] there like this leria going around it's
[2413.04 - 2420.56] knocking people's socks off man it is
[2417.08 - 2424.52] hitting people hard like there's a leria

[2424.52 - 2429.76] food you got to be careful and it's it's
[2428.20 - 2431.76] it's been rough for a lot of people who
[2429.76 - 2434.24] get who get actually poisoned by that
[2431.76 - 2436.32] stuff so what I like to do is I like to
[2434.24 - 2437.92] wash stuff good maybe I'll actually do
[2436.32 - 2439.84] do something on just that alone where

[2442.40 - 2446.80] and I'll just wash the crap out of a ton
[2445.32 - 2448.28] of different things that be like this is
[2446.80 - 2450.64] how you wash a radish this is how you

[2509.64 - 2512.56] okay A lot of people are so sick that
[2511.40 - 2513.60] even when they find out what's wrong
[2512.56 - 2515.00] with them through medical medum
[2513.60 - 2516.84] information they still need to take time
[2515.00 - 2519.12] to heal because they've been sick for so
[2516.84 - 2523.04] long was so
[2519.12 - 2525.56] bad it is a long windy road especially

[2541.56 - 2546.64] going on and and this matters what I'm
[2544.24 - 2548.48] saying you know I know there's talk out
[2546.64 - 2551.44] there people saying viruses don't exist
[2548.48 - 2554.96] viruses every time I hear someone else
[2551.44 - 2557.64] say that out there I'm like really
[2554.96 - 2559.36] really are you really going to are you
[2557.64 - 2561.40] really going to go around saying that
[2559.36 - 2564.24] out there and a lot of people say that
[2561.40 - 2569.24] viruses don't exist they don't they take
[2564.24 - 2571.40] a new age a new age you know view at it
[2569.24 - 2573.68] and they're like viruses aren't wild why
[2571.40 - 2575.28] people are sick or you or it's somebody
[2573.68 - 2576.68] that's not even doing a new age version
[2575.28 - 2578.24] of it they're just somebody that's like
[2576.68 - 2579.52] it's all about detoxing cleansing and
[2578.24 - 2581.40] toxins everybody's sick just because of
[2579.52 - 2582.88] toxins toxins toxins there's no viruses
[2581.40 - 2586.12] viruses don't
[2582.88 - 2589.68] exist if you get tricked into viruses
[2586.12 - 2593.60] don't exist if you get brainwashed into
[2589.68 - 2596.40] viruses don't exist and you're sick it's
[2593.60 - 2596.40] going to be a hard
[2596.60 - 2604.32] Road A Hard Road all
[2601.24 - 2607.72] right because let me tell you something
[2604.32 - 2614.08] they do exist herpy simplex one one
[2607.72 - 2617.20] herpes simplex 2 they do exist it is
[2614.08 - 2620.12] real it is
[2617.20 - 2623.52] real I'm going to make
[2620.12 - 2625.24] a zucchini dressing in a bit so I'm just
[2623.52 - 2627.88] preparing
[2625.24 - 2629.80] this and those aren't the only viruses
[2627.88 - 2631.96] stress and emotional turmoil can lower
[2629.80 - 2634.24] the immune system allowing viruses to
[2631.96 - 2638.84] increase their power increase their
[2634.24 - 2642.48] ability to spread and proliferate stress
[2638.84 - 2645.08] hardships right emotional
[2642.48 - 2649.84] turmoil it can lower the immune system
[2645.08 - 2651.40] for viruses to break out viruses to
[2649.84 - 2654.92] Surge
[2651.40 - 2656.20] okay all right I've always talked about
[2654.92 - 2657.80] this for years I've talked about it in
[2656.20 - 2659.48] the books and so forth check in the mac
[2657.80 - 2661.12] and cheese one more time don't want it
[2659.48 - 2663.36] burnt burnt I just want it nice and
[2661.12 - 2667.68] toasty Brown on the top and we're almost
[2663.36 - 2669.68] there just about ready all right
[2667.68 - 2674.12] it's got some tomatoes on the salad you
[2669.68 - 2675.68] guys don't mind okay so yeah so what
[2674.12 - 2677.64] you'll find you'll find a lot of people
[2675.68 - 2679.88] like oh viruses don't exist it's just a
[2677.64 - 2683.16] de or or you'll find something like it's
[2679.88 - 2684.60] just a DNA strand it's R you know RNA
[2683.16 - 2687.08] strand that's all it is it's just a
[2684.60 - 2690.12] strand of something and that's what
[2687.08 - 2693.52] people say too they'll be like you know
[2690.12 - 2695.56] it's not it's not really a virus cell
[2693.52 - 2699.56] it's not a virus but it is viruses are
[2695.56 - 2703.48] viral cells they like to eat
[2699.56 - 2705.00] okay they Thrive they like to thrive in
[2703.48 - 2707.84] environments that they can eat toxic
[2705.00 - 2710.24] heavy metals they can not only eat toxic
[2707.84 - 2714.52] heavy metals but they can eat all kinds
[2710.24 - 2718.76] of poisons and different kinds of foods
[2714.52 - 2722.48] that viruses like okay viruses are real
[2718.76 - 2724.36] they eat they're hungry they want to
[2722.48 - 2728.08] live
[2724.36 - 2731.24] retroviruses also want to live viruses
[2728.08 - 2735.72] technically do not want to kill the
[2731.24 - 2738.72] host viruses don't do not viruses would
[2735.72 - 2741.04] prefer that you stay viruses would
[2738.72 - 2743.28] prefer that you stay relatively healthy
[2741.04 - 2745.00] so you can be a super
[2743.28 - 2748.20] spreader you
[2745.00 - 2751.92] know so you can spread Epstein
[2748.20 - 2754.24] bar and spread it far and wide viruses
[2751.92 - 2756.36] want you to be strong enough and healthy
[2754.24 - 2759.40] enough like a lot of people are out
[2756.36 - 2763.48] there as they're spreading the viruses
[2759.40 - 2767.56] setala virus hhv6 hhv7 herpes simplex 1
[2763.48 - 2770.72] herp Simplex 2 shingles viruses want
[2767.56 - 2773.08] people to be healthy enough to just
[2770.72 - 2776.00] spread Spread spread because the viruses
[2773.08 - 2778.68] want to live live live viruses don't
[2776.00 - 2778.68] want to
[2779.80 - 2783.04] die they
[2783.16 - 2792.16] don't viruses are are lab creat need it
[2790.16 - 2795.64] engineered they're
[2792.16 - 2798.64] engineered right in the labs and some
[2795.64 - 2802.72] are engineered in the labs to kill
[2798.64 - 2804.52] people right but even over time when
[2802.72 - 2807.48] it's been engineered in the lab to kill
[2804.52 - 2811.76] people as the virus goes through enough
[2807.48 - 2811.76] people it stops killing
[2811.84 - 2817.16] people doesn't kill them as fast even if
[2814.88 - 2819.64] they're engineered to kill people the
[2817.16 - 2822.44] viruses don't end up killing as many
[2819.64 - 2823.88] people ver you know getting to a point
[2822.44 - 2826.76] where they don't even kill hardly
[2823.88 - 2830.12] anybody because the virus ends up
[2826.76 - 2833.04] wanting to live forever Just Like a
[2830.12 - 2833.04] person wants to live
[2835.40 - 2838.96] forever but you'll see out there there's
[2837.68 - 2840.92] like a lot of new age thought and the
[2838.96 - 2842.56] new age thought is viruses aren't real
[2840.92 - 2845.36] they don't exist it's all these other
[2842.56 - 2848.12] reasons why people are sick yeah you
[2845.36 - 2851.40] keep on thinking that
[2848.12 - 2855.04] that is such a trap that is such a trap
[2851.40 - 2856.16] walking along here that's a trap boom
[2855.04 - 2860.84] you're
[2856.16 - 2860.84] down that's a trap that's a tiger
[2861.36 - 2865.92] snare I'd say like I don't know three
[2863.72 - 2868.40] more minutes maybe three more minutes on
[2865.92 - 2870.48] that I'm going to pop some cucumber on
[2868.40 - 2872.92] this okay so I'm not going to do the
[2870.48 - 2875.40] whole circles I'm going to do like the
[2872.92 - 2878.76] half
[2875.40 - 2880.24] Moons okay
[2878.76 - 2883.56] and shingles can cause somebody the
[2880.24 - 2885.16] worst debilitating pain shingles can
[2883.56 - 2886.36] make somebody so miserable they don't
[2885.16 - 2889.16] even want to live
[2886.36 - 2891.88] anymore epine bar can create a situation
[2889.16 - 2894.76] in people where they got Ms multiple
[2891.88 - 2897.44] sceris diagnosis or they get a you know
[2894.76 - 2901.68] fibro diagnosis an RA
[2897.44 - 2903.36] diagnosis okay herpes simplex well that
[2901.68 - 2905.00] can do a lot of things can get into the
[2903.36 - 2907.24] brain stem it can get into the central
[2905.00 - 2910.80] nervous system in so many ways Herby
[2907.24 - 2913.44] simplex one two the point is is that
[2910.80 - 2915.52] these viruses live in everybody they sit
[2913.44 - 2918.96] there they percolate they want to be
[2915.52 - 2921.44] spread they want to live and they also
[2918.96 - 2924.44] you know keep the person miserable over
[2921.44 - 2924.44] time
[2926.96 - 2933.44] and so knowing how to heal is knowing
[2929.76 - 2934.64] how to pulverize and beat those viruses
[2933.44 - 2938.88] to
[2934.64 - 2941.16] death that's the key it's not so much
[2938.88 - 2943.48] the key as detoxing detoxing detoxing
[2941.16 - 2945.88] detoxing you know that that's that's a
[2943.48 - 2949.12] that's a word that many people in the
[2945.88 - 2950.60] health movement in the last 40 years
[2949.12 - 2952.08] said because they didn't know anybody
[2950.60 - 2953.24] was sick with viruses they didn't know
[2952.08 - 2955.60] anybody was sick with viruses the
[2953.24 - 2957.48] hygienic movement is a prime example of
[2955.60 - 2958.88] how they had no idea no conception that
[2957.48 - 2961.40] viruses were causing any of the illness
[2958.88 - 2963.00] I know because I talked about I talk to
[2961.40 - 2966.16] Natural hygienist throughout the years
[2963.00 - 2968.28] holistic hygienists the movement doctors
[2966.16 - 2971.08] and people in the health field for the
[2968.28 - 2972.96] last 40 years I've talked to many they
[2971.08 - 2975.12] had no clue what caused his illness at
[2972.96 - 2978.16] all besides oh the person's toxic the
[2975.12 - 2981.52] person's toxic take this rout do this
[2978.16 - 2983.84] try this the person's to water fast for
[2981.52 - 2985.44] three weeks the person's toxic that'll
[2983.84 - 2987.72] fix them you know many people water fast
[2985.44 - 2989.16] for 3 weeks came out of that water fast
[2987.72 - 2991.16] sicker than ever or came out of that
[2989.16 - 2993.04] water fast and just got sick all over
[2991.16 - 2995.56] again but worse than they ever did
[2993.04 - 2999.92] because the water fast wasn't killing
[2995.56 - 3001.96] the viruses it wasn't cleaning up the
[2999.92 - 3004.56] viruses all right let's see if I can get
[3001.96 - 3004.56] that out right
[3006.24 - 3013.20] there all right I'd say we're good it's

[3117.40 - 3121.88] what's going on here so I'm just
[3119.20 - 3121.88] preparing a few
[3127.08 - 3132.28] radishes I've been in the health scene
[3129.76 - 3135.84] for a long
[3132.28 - 3135.84] time very long
[3136.00 - 3142.24] time not
[3137.92 - 3147.00] by a wanting to or that's what I want to
[3142.24 - 3150.04] do I was forced into it at a young age
[3147.00 - 3153.12] AG starting at 4 years
[3150.04 - 3157.56] old with Spirit of
[3153.12 - 3159.20] compassion who I argued with many many
[3157.56 - 3162.08] many a
[3159.20 - 3165.00] time because of it
[3162.08 - 3167.04] all and what I have discovered was
[3165.00 - 3168.56] nobody knew viruses were behind all the
[3167.04 - 3170.36] symptoms conditions neurological
[3168.56 - 3173.44] symptoms all the different illnesses
[3170.36 - 3173.44] they had no
[3174.64 - 3180.48] idea toxins
[3176.96 - 3182.84] were the only thing anyone ever said and
[3180.48 - 3182.84] that was
[3183.64 - 3188.52] it so I'm going to slice up some of
[3185.96 - 3192.16] these radishes I'm doing half Boons on
[3188.52 - 3192.16] them if you guys are okay there we
[3192.52 - 3197.76] go Spirit of compassion told me that the
[3195.20 - 3200.64] viruses are a huge part it's not just
[3197.76 - 3203.88] toxins and what toxins it's another
[3200.64 - 3207.28] thing too back years ago 20 30 years ago
[3203.88 - 3209.84] it was just toxins do it water fast cuz
[3207.28 - 3209.84] it was just
[3210.52 - 3215.00] toxins what
[3212.52 - 3216.84] toxins no one knew toxic heavy metals
[3215.00 - 3218.68] were giving people all the different
[3216.84 - 3219.92] symptoms and conditions that they've
[3218.68 - 3222.08] learned about with the medical medium
[3219.92 - 3223.48] books today that they poached and you
[3222.08 - 3225.08] know go around and even though there's
[3223.48 - 3226.44] no studies behind it because it comes
[3225.08 - 3230.76] from mm
[3226.44 - 3232.68] info but the point I'm trying to say is
[3230.76 - 3234.36] I see people still stuck in the mud out
[3232.68 - 3238.44] there they're sick they ain't never
[3234.36 - 3238.44] going to heal they ain't
[3238.72 - 3243.92] and it's sad because they think viruses
[3241.32 - 3247.24] don't exist or they think a water fast
[3243.92 - 3248.68] is going to fix everything and meanwhile
[3247.24 - 3250.40] they're not left with the correct
[3248.68 - 3252.84] information after they recover from a
[3250.40 - 3254.84] water fast this is just one example or
[3252.84 - 3255.88] maybe they think they need a cold plunge
[3254.84 - 3258.24] themselves
[3255.88 - 3260.72] crazy while they're damaging their
[3258.24 - 3264.40] adrenals people want quick fixes man
[3260.72 - 3268.36] they want quick fixes but the truth is
[3264.40 - 3268.36] they don't know why they're sick
[3268.44 - 3272.40] and you have to know why you're sick you
[3270.80 - 3274.16] got to know when metals are causing the
[3272.40 - 3276.24] problems when it really is Metals that's
[3274.16 - 3277.76] right you have to know when it's viruses
[3276.24 - 3280.72] and it's really viruses and you have to
[3277.76 - 3283.12] know other stuff too Marg says it feels
[3280.72 - 3284.64] like everything else has forgotten about
[3283.12 - 3288.80] health
[3284.64 - 3291.28] history only aw is talking is talking to
[3288.80 - 3293.52] us about what trends were out there and
[3291.28 - 3295.28] crazy thoughts that's true I don't see
[3293.52 - 3296.68] anybody talking about it out there
[3295.28 - 3299.56] because a lot of people in Health right
[3296.68 - 3302.80] now on social social media they're all
[3299.56 - 3306.40] the people on social media they're all
[3302.80 - 3308.24] new most of them are new brand new off
[3306.40 - 3310.08] the press they got into it six years ago
[3308.24 - 3312.24] four years ago three years ago two years
[3310.08 - 3314.40] ago last year and they're just shouting
[3312.24 - 3315.80] out stuff and you know and the whole bit
[3314.40 - 3318.04] but they don't know they don't know the
[3315.80 - 3319.64] history they don't know what happened
[3318.04 - 3321.12] and then there's bacteria turning into
[3319.64 - 3323.36] Super
[3321.12 - 3324.36] bugs there's that too all right we got
[3323.36 - 3327.00] some
[3324.36 - 3329.12] radishes there's strep
[3327.00 - 3332.04] right but you know the industry thought
[3329.12 - 3334.28] strep only did a certain thing but no
[3332.04 - 3336.32] does a lot more causes a lot more
[3334.28 - 3339.04] problems all
[3336.32 - 3342.44] right how does that look so
[3339.04 - 3345.76] far I like this bowl too tiktock you
[3342.44 - 3349.32] guys see that IG you guys see that right
[3345.76 - 3349.32] there YouTube you guys see that
[3349.72 - 3357.60] right deficiencies are a problem as well
[3353.48 - 3359.68] they are but deficiencies
[3357.60 - 3361.08] don't explain it all on how somebody's
[3359.68 - 3363.36] sick and how they have viral
[3361.08 - 3365.64] inflammation and bacterial you know
[3363.36 - 3367.16] infections low grade and low grade and
[3365.64 - 3369.60] high grade and the differences between
[3367.16 - 3371.72] low grade and high grade and all of that
[3369.60 - 3374.56] right I want to make a dressing if you
[3371.72 - 3374.56] guys are okay with
[3375.76 - 3382.04] that okay that is cooling down the mac
[3379.04 - 3384.00] and cheese you guys just got on
[3382.04 - 3385.40] here just want to show you right here
[3384.00 - 3387.56] it's cooling down enough for me to take
[3385.40 - 3389.92] my hands and actually really put it on
[3387.56 - 3392.52] here show you
[3389.92 - 3393.68] guys there it is can't wait to crack
[3392.52 - 3396.60] into
[3393.68 - 3398.84] it all right I'm going to get a blender
[3396.60 - 3402.04] over here but I'm going to grab this
[3398.84 - 3402.04] first right
[3405.56 - 3411.96] here okay three cups raw peeled DIC
[3410.32 - 3413.32] zucchini I'm going to peel these
[3411.96 - 3416.56] zucchinis right
[3413.32 - 3422.04] now really quick
[3416.56 - 3422.04] is what I'm going to do boom so all
[3422.96 - 3429.48] right and then keep this in mind okay so
[3427.68 - 3430.56] it happens all over again you think
[3429.48 - 3432.00] you're getting somewhere and you think
[3430.56 - 3433.76] you're getting the information out there
[3432.00 - 3435.68] you think people are are getting the
[3433.76 - 3438.24] information they need and then boom
[3435.68 - 3439.60] viruses don't exist anymore oh viruses
[3438.24 - 3441.60] don't eat
[3439.60 - 3444.08] anything I think one of the most
[3441.60 - 3446.76] powerful powerful pieces of information
[3444.08 - 3449.76] to actually use to
[3446.76 - 3452.40] is knowing that a bug eats something and
[3449.76 - 3455.64] then learning what the bug eats so you
[3452.40 - 3458.56] can withhold that certain food from the
[3455.64 - 3461.60] bug and when you can withhold that food
[3458.56 - 3463.92] from the bug like
[3461.60 - 3466.80] cheese I've never ripped apart the whole
[3463.92 - 3468.96] dairy industry I've never done the whole
[3466.80 - 3471.60] radical vegan thing where the vegans
[3468.96 - 3474.92] like they get so crazy they burn down
[3471.60 - 3477.56] buildings you know right I'm not I'm not
[3474.92 - 3481.12] whatever I'm not p on vegans that's not
[3477.56 - 3483.52] it it's the reason why s
[3481.12 - 3487.52] so went for the
[3483.52 - 3489.64] cheese the dairy and said you can't have
[3487.52 - 3491.12] that in if you're sick with these bugs
[3489.64 - 3493.68] these certain viruses because certain
[3491.12 - 3496.56] viruses will feed on that Dairy and feed
[3493.68 - 3499.92] on that cheese okay it's not because of
[3496.56 - 3502.20] any other reason you can be plant-based
[3499.92 - 3503.80] vegan doing medical medium using the
[3502.20 - 3505.88] tools in healing I said this so many
[3503.80 - 3508.92] times and you could be animal protein
[3505.88 - 3511.04] you using medical medium tools and
[3508.92 - 3513.00] healing but there's certain things that
[3511.04 - 3514.52] are critical if you're sick with chronic
[3513.00 - 3516.28] fatigue if you're sick with all the
[3514.52 - 3520.20] different conditions and
[3516.28 - 3522.84] symptoms it's knowing that cheese will
[3520.20 - 3524.52] feed a bug now here's the deal if you
[3522.84 - 3526.12] get told well cheese isn't good for you
[3524.52 - 3527.52] it's inflammatory maybe because they
[3526.12 - 3529.72] learned it's inflammatory from medical
[3527.52 - 3531.64] medum information because remember Dairy
[3529.72 - 3535.84] wasn't inflammatory all these years
[3531.64 - 3538.28] that's mm info Dari was not inflammatory
[3535.84 - 3541.48] it it was just it was a vegetarian thing
[3538.28 - 3544.84] vegetarians ate Dairy cuz Dairy was
[3541.48 - 3548.88] healthy supposedly right healthy nobody
[3544.84 - 3551.48] knew nobody knew that Dairy fed bugs
[3548.88 - 3553.44] that Dairy feeds viruses that's medical
[3551.48 - 3556.36] meme info but when you learn that piece
[3553.44 - 3558.80] of powerful information it really keeps
[3556.36 - 3560.72] you from eating not eating the dairy in
[3558.80 - 3562.04] that moment and then somebody will say
[3560.72 - 3563.92] I'm going to go and punish medical
[3562.04 - 3566.68] medium out there and talk crap about him
[3563.92 - 3569.04] and I'm going to show like a cheese dish
[3566.68 - 3571.00] and say I'm not restricted medical
[3569.04 - 3574.08] medium restricts everybody from eating
[3571.00 - 3575.80] cheese I can eat cheese right here look
[3574.08 - 3577.72] sure of course you can but if you got
[3575.80 - 3579.48] chronic sickness and illness and you got
[3577.72 - 3581.40] MS symptoms and you got neurological
[3579.48 - 3583.84] Lyme symptoms and you got every symptom
[3581.40 - 3584.60] ALS symptom under the all kinds of Under
[3583.84 - 3586.68] the
[3584.60 - 3589.16] Sun all
[3586.68 - 3591.36] kinds right you're going to want to stay
[3589.16 - 3593.28] away from the cheese and when you learn
[3591.36 - 3598.04] why you should stay away from the
[3593.28 - 3600.24] cheese boom you can move forward it's so
[3598.04 - 3602.20] important and then hey you get yourself
[3600.24 - 3604.12] better you get rid of the bugs you kill
[3602.20 - 3605.52] off those viruses you learn how to do it
[3604.12 - 3608.28] through medical medum information you
[3605.52 - 3610.64] pulverize and destroy those bugs and
[3608.28 - 3612.92] they leave your system yes they detox
[3610.64 - 3614.52] out of your system once you kill them
[3612.92 - 3615.80] and you want to eat a piece of cheese
[3614.52 - 3618.92] because you had your heart set on it
[3615.80 - 3618.92] then you eat a piece of cheese
[3621.96 - 3627.88] whatever all right I'm going
[3624.44 - 3630.00] to pop some zucchinis in here this is
[3627.88 - 3633.08] one right
[3630.00 - 3634.04] here I'm taking these skins and moving
[3633.08 - 3636.40] them
[3634.04 - 3638.68] over you saw what this floor looked like
[3636.40 - 3640.76] right now everything just went on Amanda
[3638.68 - 3642.80] says I never felt right with dairy but
[3640.76 - 3645.44] then I got addicted to ice cream chronic
[3642.80 - 3647.32] UTI disappeared as soon as I eliminated
[3645.44 - 3651.24] the dairy and other no Foods the reason
[3647.32 - 3654.52] why is because the dairy was feeding the
[3651.24 - 3656.40] strep that creates the UTI that's how it
[3654.52 - 3660.12] works but nobody knew that it didn't
[3656.40 - 3663.00] exist never existed out there it's mm
[3660.12 - 3666.00] info mm published info all right so I'm
[3663.00 - 3666.00] going to chop and
[3666.32 - 3673.40] dice senini it's going to go in here

[4200.40 - 4203.04] actually add more zucchini and it
[4201.96 - 4205.20] lighten it up but I think I'm going to
[4203.04 - 4208.36] do that why not I'm actually going to do
[4205.20 - 4210.80] that you put this here for a
[4208.36 - 4214.96] second give it that

[4328.40 - 4333.72] lemon here we go I want a bigger
[4331.80 - 4335.08] dressing cuz I have a feeling that salad
[4333.72 - 4339.28] is so
[4335.08 - 4341.76] big that I just want a little bit
[4339.28 - 4345.76] more
[4341.76 - 4345.76] y and
[4346.00 - 4348.64] me see
[4350.80 - 4355.16] here do is add a little bit more
[4355.32 - 4359.92] lemon when you do a salad this big you
[4357.96 - 4361.64] might have somebody that like has a lot
[4359.92 - 4364.96] of dressing and they're like did you
[4361.64 - 4367.40] make enough where's the rest of it now
[4364.96 - 4369.68] the the um dill and the parsley you want
[4367.40 - 4374.44] to chop up and throw kind of into it
[4369.68 - 4374.44] later I blended it in
[4376.52 - 4380.68] there we
[4377.68 - 4380.68] go
[4388.00 - 4393.28] nice all right let's put a lid on it you
[4391.48 - 4397.32] guys I can't wait to crack into that mac
[4393.28 - 4397.32] and cheese tell you right
[4403.16 - 4408.24] now you go
[4405.76 - 4408.24] make a little
[4422.20 - 4426.60] B there we go
[4435.32 - 4437.60] this
[4439.04 - 4444.24] one all right just going to clean up a
[4441.04 - 4444.24] little bit
[4471.08 - 4474.32] all
[4472.08 - 4476.56] right you guys I'm going to pour a
[4474.32 - 4479.16] little bit of this on the
[4476.56 - 4484.48] salad or actually have it on the side is
[4479.16 - 4484.48] what I'm going to do get a new bow
[4487.68 - 4492.56] here can I put this right here
[4498.16 - 4502.12] chop up a little dill and put it on
[4509.12 - 4513.60] top sprinkle a little bit on top of
[4514.56 - 4517.96] here grab a
[4519.36 - 4524.60] spoon okay so here's a dressing now what
[4521.92 - 4525.96] happens is when you have guests they may
[4524.60 - 4528.16] want the dressing on the side they may
[4525.96 - 4530.76] not want it all put on top of your salad
[4528.16 - 4534.48] and mixed in so I just did a side one
[4530.76 - 4536.40] right here as you can see okay um and
[4534.48 - 4539.72] then somebody can put it on their salad
[4536.40 - 4542.32] as they wish that's a great way of doing
[4539.72 - 4544.72] it I have to do it that way cuz I'm not
[4542.32 - 4545.72] sure how everybody's going to want to
[4544.72 - 4548.52] have
[4545.72 - 4551.12] it versus me just dumping it on like I
