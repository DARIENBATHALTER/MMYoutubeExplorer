condition you're far from from

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:38,640

11

it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,920
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,160
William we're talking about the soul and

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,480
emotional Soul healing everyone is soul

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,160
searching whether they know it or not

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,399
but what are we really searching for

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,720
happiness peace tranquility

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:08,400

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,920
we can grab some lemon bomb find a comfy

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,119
place to relax and let's get to

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,360
it so everybody is soul searching

23
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,560
someone once told me you're either soul

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,400
searching or you're not and then Spirit

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,799
of compassion

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,920
said you're either soul searching or

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,280
you're soul

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,040
searching because that's the truth even

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,079
if somebody doesn't know it even if they

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,119
don't call it that so that's another

31
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,439
thing like you may run into somebody and

32
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,920
doesn't seem they don't think they're

33
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,479
soul searching on any level they're just

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,960
doing their thing living their

35
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,240
life but they don't know they're soul

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,840
searching they're soul searching but

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,000
they don't call it that they're not

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,560
aware that it's soul searching right we

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,759
Soul search because part of us feels

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,079
lost how many how many people do you

41
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:07,360
know have that feeling of being lost

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,160
that lost sensation like a

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,959
sadness at a certain time of day what if

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,480
it's like 3 4:00 in the afternoon and

45
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,280
then a strange sadness comes over I know

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,720
so many people that have it at different

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,200
times and it's this thing you can't

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,040
really explain but it's there we Soul

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,200
search because part of us feels lost or

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,200
we don't feel whole like there's a piece

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,080
of us missing like we're not all of our

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,519
pieces aren't there in place right it's

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,680
just there's a piece of ourselves

54
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,440
missing or because we feel like we're

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,640
not living up to our Soul's potential we

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,959
Soul search because of life's

57
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,040
hardships that's another thing too is

58
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,519
life's

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,360
hardships make it so we want to go and

60
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,319
soul search as well right often a

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,599
negative experience or a series of them

62
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,760
will prompt a person to feel broken or

63
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,760
depleted did you ever feel broken or

64
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,319
depleted like you just had something

65
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,280
happen in your life right something

66
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,560
happened in your life and it just pushed

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,920
you over the edge like you were on your

68
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,480
last Heather if you were a bird you felt

69
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,519
like you were on your last feathers I

70
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,080
mean where you just felt like you were

71
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,360
pushed over hanging on the cliff like

72
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,360
done did you ever use that term where

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,120
you're like I'm done I'm done

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,680
right so many people have felt like that

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
where they're at a place where they like

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,200
okay I'm done or this relationship so

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,000
many people they're in a relationship

78
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,760
that's toxic there's a lot of emotional

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,439
turmoil in the relationship there's a

80
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,400
lot going on in the relationship and

81
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,000
they're just like I'm done I can't take

82
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,920
this anymore I can't handle this anymore

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,599
so often a negative experience or a

84
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,000
series of them will prompt the person to

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:58,159
feel broken or depleted and want to feel

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,720
complete again it's like I want to feel

87
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,560
whole again I want to feel like myself

88
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,599
again and maybe I don't even know what

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,519
myself felt like but I want to feel it I

90
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:13,519
want to feel like I got all those pieces

91
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,760
of my soul back I want to feel like I'm

92
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,000
not

93
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,519
lost I want to feel like connected to

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,040
something I want that sensation I want

95
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,240
that feeling and if you have chronic

96
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,040
illness and you don't feel good and

97
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,440
you're struggling with chronic illness

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,360
then it really amplifies it and makes

99
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,240
the even harder that feeling of wanting

100
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,680
to be complete again that feeling of not

101
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:43,320
wanting to feel lost that feeling of no

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,960
one understands me that feeling of

103
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,199
something's

104
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,479
missing that's when we need that soul

105
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,960
searching that's part of soul searching

106
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,759
right there it can take the form of

107
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,479
attending Retreats how many people

108
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
attend Retreats they're looking for

109
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,960
something how many

110
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,600
people are looking for something thing

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,960
so they'll go anywhere and they'll do

112
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,280
anything they're looking for answers or

113
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,240
they're looking for that piece of what's

114
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,520
lost to come

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,680
back sometimes it takes going to hear

116
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,360
inspirational speakers seeking advice

117
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,280

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,080
many people are in counseling how many

119
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,600
people have had so many counselors

120
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,319
emotional

121
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,280

going wrong I mean these are feelings

138
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,960
that we naturally feel that everybody

139
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,680
feels at some point in their life and

140
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,639
maybe they don't feel it now but they

141
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,520
might feel it at another time it's what

142
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,360
we do when we're looking to heal and

143
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,720
Elevate our souls to strengthen our

144
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,520
purpose in life we we look for help

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,479
because we want to strengthen that

146
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,639
purpose we want to unlock something in

147
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:34,599
our soul and we want to heal your soul

148
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,759
resides in your brain something people

149
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,000
don't know now this is going to sound

150
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,960
kind of gory I know it's kind of a

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,319
little off topic but it's not really off

152
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,800
topic it's a little

153
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,440
gory but back in the olden days the

154
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,240
reason why they beheaded people that was

155
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,000
a very popular popular technique is

156
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,879
because back in the olden days they

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,240
sensed there was an energy all around

158
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,639
here so what they would do is Medieval

159
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,160
times they would put it they would chop

160
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,479
people's heads off and put their heads

161
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,280
on spikes right or Pikes or something

162
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,039
they would put their heads on sticks on

163
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,360
the sides of roads and all that or they

164
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,680
would behead people with Guillotines

165
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,759
right for some reason they felt like

166
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,800
that was the most satisfying way to end

167
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,720
somebody's life because there was

168
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,759
something more satiating about it in the

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,360
medieval days and what they what they

170
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,680
were actually tapping into without

171
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,720
realizing it there was a lot going on

172
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,400
here but they didn't know that's where

173
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,840
the soul resides and that's why they had

174
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,000
a desire to behead people because the

175
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,520
soul resided in the head they didn't

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,960
know

177
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,720
that they didn't know the soul resided

178
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,080
in the head but they had this innate

179
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,080
desire when they wanted to end

180
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,680
somebody's life to behead them to chop

181
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,560
off their head that was what that is why

182
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,960
they did that and then they had this

183
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,879
innate desire to exhibit

184
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,800
someone's head chopped off they had this

185
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,080
innate desire to actually exhibit it so

186
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,759
exhibit the head on a pike on the sides

187
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,840
of Roads or in villages where they would

188
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,680
slay a village and then they would chop

189
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,560
off everybody's head and put it on Pikes

190
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,479
because they felt that a message was

191
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,680
sent

192
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,680
more and what it was was what they were

193
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,440
detecting yeah it's gory but what they

194
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,680
were what they were detecting was there

195
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,640
was more energy here even though the

196
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,800
whole body there was more body weight

197
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,919
and body mass everywhere else there was

198
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,479
more energy

199
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,640
here so what they were detecting without

200
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,360
realizing it they were detecting the

201
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,920
soul was here inside the brain so they

202
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,560
had a great desire if they wanted to end

203
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,399
somebody's life back in the in the

204
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,800
medieval the Dark Ages they would chop

205
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,640
off the

206
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:00,800
head your soul resides in your brain

207
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,160
where your soul stores memories and

208
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,000
experiences that's where your soul is

209
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,680
storing memories and

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,519
experiences they're in the soul when our

211
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,519
soul leaves our body it

212
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:16,399
takes these experiences with it when you

213
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,399
pass from this Mortal

214
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,680
realm your soul

215
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,360
carries those memories as it moves

216
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,079
onward your soul carries those memories

217
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,399
as it moves onward so when we pass from

218
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:34,320
this Mortal place this Mortal realm

219
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:37,120
right our soul carries these memories as

220
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,760
it moves onward even if someone has a

221
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,680
brain injury or brain disease that keeps

222
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,959
her or him from remembering certain

223
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,360
things so hear this for a second so if

224
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,360
somebody has Alzheimer's

225
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,120
dementia if someone is losing their

226
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,920
train of thought losing their mind and

227
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,720
they pass away from a brain

228
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,839
disease even if someone has a brain

229
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,640
injury or brain disease like Alzheimer's

230
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:07,079
or dementia or something like that

231
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,079
incopy right that keeps her or him from

232
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:10,880
remembering certain things the soul will

233
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,079
bring all those memories with it when

234
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,600
that person passes on if you have a

235
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,839
grandfather a grandmother or a family

236
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,519
member or a friend that is losing their

237
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,360
mind because they have the Alzheimer's

238
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,120
they have dementia they're really

239
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,240
suffering they don't even know who they

240
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,480
are they lose their memory completely

241
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,920
and they pass away you have to remember

242
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,880
something the pain and suffering a loved

243
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,639
one has says where did their memories go

244
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,160
don't they remember me how come they

245
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,399
don't remember me how come they don't

246
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,639
see who I am my grandfather's sitting

247
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,399
there and he knows me I he raised me I'm

248
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,000
walking into the room and my

249
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,839
grandfather's saying how are you I don't

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,720
know who you are you have to remember

251
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,959
that every me memory that that

252
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,200
grandfather has grandmother that friend

253
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,320
that mother father that brother sister

254
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,240
every memory that they have about you

255
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,480
and their life is still trapped in there

256
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,880
it's in there just because the brain

257
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,800
disease is eating away neurons it

258
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,720
doesn't mean the soul doesn't take those

259
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
memories with it that's the whole point

260
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,279
and what I learned from Spirit of

261
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,320
compassion is the soul takes those

262
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,000
memories with it as it

263
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,880
leaves so it's not like that family

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,440
member their lives are just completely

265
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,880
wiped out and completely gone it's not

266
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,480
like that at all it's the opposite yes

267
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,360
in that moment it feels that way but

268
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,760
when they leave and their soul passes on

269
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,720
they have all the memories there they

270
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,720
didn't lose that they know who you are

271
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,320
when a grandfather grandmother a friend

272
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,440
or a family member soul is leaving them

273
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,480
as they pass in that moment even if they

274
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,160
lost ability to understand who you were

275
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,639
as they were fading away they still when

276
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:02,120
they leave and that Soul lifts up from

277
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:05,240
that body they instantly know you who

278
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,959
you are every memory they shared with

279
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,720
you everything about you all that

280
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,600
they've done with you every experience

281
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:17,199
they've ever had with you they know and

282
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,199
they see it and see you as their soul

283
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,600
leaves the body your soul also stores

284
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,120
your hope people don't realize that that

285
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,079
their soul actually stores their hope do

286
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,199
you think you're hopeless you're not you

287
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,880
think you have no hope anymore uhuh

288
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:35,320
that's not true you think you've lost

289
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:39,040
all your hope no no no no no you didn't

290
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,440
lose all your hope your hope is stored

291
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,160
it's

292
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,440
stored in your soul there's a well of it

293
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,240
in your soul your soul also stores faith

294
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,240
if you have faith in God your soul

295
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,240
stores that faith if you have faith in

296
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,000
Jesus Christ your soul stores that faith

297
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
if you're a Christian and you have faith

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,480
in Jesus Christ if for some reason

299
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,639
you're a Christian and you lost faith in

300
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,720
Jesus Christ I promise you this your

301
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,040
soul still has faith in Jesus Christ if

302
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,720
you're someone that's not a Christian

303
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,680
and you just believe in God and God God

304
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,399
is who you believe in and you have faith

305
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,880
in God and you have tremendous faith in

306
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,519
God and then all of a sudden something

307
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,839
happens to you in your life and you lose

308
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,920
faith in God I promise you this your

309
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,399
soul still stores your faith in God if

310
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,720
you think you lost trust and you had

311
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,399
trust and now you can't trust anything

312
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,040
anymore and you can't trust anyone

313
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,199
anymore you can't trust anyone you can't

314
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,680
trust anything anymore cuz you lost

315
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,639
trust I can promise you this that you

316
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,279
have trust stored in your soul reason

317
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,639
for that is it helps to keep us on the

318
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,120
right path so we stay stay present here

319
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,720
ideally we would all have fully intact

320
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,079
Souls over the course of life's

321
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,199
hardships though a soul can become

322
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:58,279
fractured and even lose pieces of itself

323
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,519
but that's okay because we still never

324
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,399
lose our soul this can be caused by

325
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,560
traumatic events traumatic events can

326
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,759
fracture our soul but that's all right

327
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,000
because our soul can mend and heal our

328
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,440
soul is

329
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,440
unbreakable it is unbreakable regardless

330
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,639
of a fracture regardless of hardships

331
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,519
beating it down and wearing and tearing

332
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,399
on your soul it is

333
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,399
unbreakable this can be caused by

334
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,320
traumatic events such as the death of a

335
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,000
loved one so many people go through

336
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,600
betrayal by a loved one or betrayal of

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,519
oneself as well as ongoing traumas such

338
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,320
as the loss of freedom and trust that

339
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,560
comes with experiencing chronic symptoms

340
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,000
and illness I think so many people have

341
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,079
been beaten down with their illness you

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,160
guys know about that you had

343
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,720
symptoms or you still have them because

344
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
you just found medical medium and you're

345
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,279
working on your healing process but

346
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,680
you've been down that road and you had

347
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,839
so many symptoms and suffered greatly so

348
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:01,399
bad and that wears and tears on the

349
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,839
soul to throughout the years I

350
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,759
would through a process that Spirit of

351
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,600
compassion has has taught me to

352
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,639
scan

353
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,880
someone and spirit of compassion would

354
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:17,279
show me if they had any fractures on

355
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,160
their soul and it resembled cracks in a

356
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,880
cathedral window that's what it

357
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,279
resembled when I would see it through

358
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,199
Spirit of compassion's eyes because a

359
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,519
soul is made out of light our souls are

360
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:29,680
a form of light that when a soul is

361
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:31,880
fractured

362
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,000
it looks like the sun it looks like the

363
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,800
inside like you're inside a church and

364
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,199
the stained glass windows there's light

365
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,440
coming through the Sun as for a soul

366
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,199
with missing pieces it's like a house at

367
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,519
night that's meant to have all its

368
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:49,880
lights on except some of its rooms are

369
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,800
still dark when Soul injuries are fresh

370
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,519
they can result in the feeling of being

371
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,040
lost or loss of connection with oneself

372
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,560
loss of Desire or inspiration to

373
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,600
preserve or thr

374
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,399
so many people lose their Inspirations

375
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,759
they feel like they're dead inside they

376
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,800
feel like they died inside they're numb

377
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,800
and they don't feel like there's

378
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,160
anything left in them they feel like

379
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,440
there's nothing there anymore they feel

380
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,079
like they are not being seen by anything

381
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,519
and they're completely alone and

382
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,519
completely in the dark and that's what

383
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,480
happens when Soul injuries are actually

384
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,079
fresh it just

385
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,160
happened I just got let down that person

386
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,800
broke my trust I feel so injured I feel

387
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,319
so misunderstood and not heard so when

388
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,399
the soul injuries are fresh they can

389
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:40,000
result in feeling like you're lost or

390
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,759
there's a loss of connection like

391
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,199
where's the connection there's no

392
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,800
connection a loss of Desire or

393
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:51,360
inspiration to persevere or Thrive or

394
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,120
even like life force how many that you

395
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,759
guys know that where you feel like you

396
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,079
lose your life force because you just

397
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,680
had such a hard time that's why

398
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:05,360
important to be aware of our soul and

399
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,199
that's how you heal emotional support is

400
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,439
understanding our own soul because

401
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,360
people they don't realize they have this

402
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,000
connection to their own soul they don't

403
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,039
know how to connect to their own

404
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,400
soul when you understand your soul and

405
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,160
and understand where it is and and if

406
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,079
it's been injured and how strong it is

407
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,120
and how powerful it is when you connect

408
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,760
to your soul that's how you can really

409
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,320
do some emo healing and rise out of

410
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,039
something that's why it's important to

411
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,520
be aware of our soul wounds from

412
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:41,919
hardships betrayal and broken trust or

413
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,919
emotional hurt often exhaust a person's

414
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,360
immune system adrenals and other bod's

415
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,160
defenses triggering a physical issue

416
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,559
that could be residing deep within our

417
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,039
organs and body so it's twofold if you

418
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,320
guys go through a hard time if somebody

419
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,520
goes through a hard

420
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,440
time I know a friend that just got

421
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,679
betrayed so bad just so bad the Betrayal

422
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,159
was just horrendous and he didn't want

423
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,760
to live

424
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:13,200
anymore but when he really understood

425
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,120
the soul connection that I was teaching

426
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,640
him

427
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,640
about it was giving him a chance to say

428
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,600
you know I could get through this you

429
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,200
can't you can't take my soul away no

430
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,200
one's going to be able to take my soul

431
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,280
away but at the same time adrenals can

432
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,559
get beaten down and our immune systems

433
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,600
can can be lowered because we're going

434
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,679
through a lot if we're betrayed it does

435
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,400
play it does take a hit on our immune

436
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:44,159
system and our physical body it can beat

437
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,400
us down our adrenals you go into this

438
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:50,400
point where your adrenaline just spikes

439
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:55,600
and feels like it gets out of control if

440
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:59,320
someone's messing with you or you had a

441
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,840
hardship someone just

442
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,520
you you know your trust you don't trust

443
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,200
them anymore something happened and all

444
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,600
of a sudden it's like adrenaline you can

445
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,559
even feel like you're shaking you get so

446
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,559
upset and hurt where you're

447
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:17,840
shaking and that's the adrenaline now

448
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,799
being released and takes a toll on the

449
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,760
body sometimes a person's soul

450
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,559
injury and resulting emotional state

451
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,559
isn't a physical problem yet symptoms

452
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,280
often take time to build quietly in the

453
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,400
back background so a soul injury at an

454
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,960
earlier time in life could be the

455
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,520
trigger for the future symptoms or

456
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,640
full-blown conditions to come if you

457
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,640
don't have the right knowledge tools and

458
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,760
resources to take care of your soul and

459
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,760
physical body we can get in trouble the

460
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,240
medical medium tools are there to

461
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,880
support your physical body and your

462
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,360
emotional body that's how you win it's

463
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,480
both they're there and even if you don't

464
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:03,200
support your your emotional body

465
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,799
and you heal physically it naturally can

466
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,159
help to heal the emotional part of what

467
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:10,000
you're going through in your life it can

468
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,720
help heal the

469
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,159
emotional

470
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,640
injuries let's be clear emotional wounds

471
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:21,240
and soul wounds are not the reason for

472
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,280
physical suffering that's important to

473
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,039
know they are not the cause of physical

474
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,760
suffering they're not the cause of

475
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,640
fibromyalgia they're not the cause of

476
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,679
thyroid cancer they're not the cause of

477
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,000
multiple

478
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:40,000
sclerosis or lupus or lime disease

479
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,240
rather they can act as

480
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,039
triggers for underlying

481
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,000
susceptibilities when we go through

482
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,080
emotional hardships it can knock us so

483
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,799
hard it lowers our immune system and it

484
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,440
triggers us when we go through emotional

485
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,520
hardships our adrenaline can really get

486
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,120
kicked into high gear because we're

487
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:04,679
emotionally injured and then we get

488
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:07,919
knocked down a notch it knocks us down I

489
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,520
can't tell you how many people that got

490
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,520
into a difficult relationship and it was

491
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,880
there was so much turmoil in that

492
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,840
relationship there was so much fighting

493
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,600
and cheating and betrayal in that

494
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,799
relationship that it lowered the immune

495
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,120
system and when it lowered the immune

496
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,000
system it broke them down and other

497
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,679
things they had residing inside of them

498
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
pathogens rose up and now they have

499
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,200
chronic fatigue syndrome they become

500
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,559
triggers but you're stronger than you

501
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,320
know have battled this long and gotten

502
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,480
yourself this far in life now you can

503
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,159
rise

504
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,360
above all this is knowledge so you can

505
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,600
rise above your wounds you can rise

506
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,480
above the injuries physically that

507
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,520
you've

508
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,520
had the

509
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,600
pathogens the exposures you can rise

510
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,919
above that and heal your emotions too

511
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:06,559
and Rise Above any kind of Soul injuries

512
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,559
a person with soul injury is vulnerable

513
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,120
if you ever hear a friend say I'm not

514
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,640
ready for another relationship I'm still

515
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,640
hurting from my breakup she's

516
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,200
acknowledging that her soul needs time

517
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,880
to heal before she risks putting herself

518
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,159
out there again so many of us know when

519
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,600
our soul is is vulnerable we know that

520
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,640
we're susceptible we know it's like whoa

521
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,240
I can't do that right now I can't go

522
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,640
through that again right now I I need to

523
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,480
step back a little bit my soul isn't

524
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,400
feeling that strong my soul's not

525
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,760
feeling strong enough along the same

526
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,799
lines if you ever observe someone who's

527
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,520
sick with symptoms or conditions and

528
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:47,919
hasn't been able to find answers you may

529
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,000
see this person hungrily pursuing

530
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,799
spiritual learning in any form like

531
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,840
religion spiritual gurus self-help books

532
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,960
meditation Retreats breath work it's

533
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,799
likely because that person's soul has

534
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:07,360
been injured from all the trust lost

535
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,880
along the way and she or he is

536
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,840
instinctively searching for ways to make

537
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,000
the soul healthy and complete again when

538
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,200
we fall ill with symptoms that won't go

539
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,840
away or that continue to come and go we

540
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,320
lose trust in our body and in others to

541
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,960
help us there are people who have been

542
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,039
sick for years who turn to soul

543
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,400
searching when they can't find answers

544
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,400
and that's another thing too I I watched

545
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,840
this for decades people are looking for

546
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,520
Spiritual answers because no one knows

547
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,679
why they're sick physically what was

548
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,679
really popular back like 30 years ago 25

549
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,520
years ago was because nobody knew of

550
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,480
course why anybody was sick with chronic

551
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,679
illness you go and find

552
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,919
somebody and then you try to find some

553
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,039
kind of healer to to give you any kind

554
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,520
of answer and there's a good chance

555
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,520
they'll tell you it's because you had

556
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,400
your head chopped off off in

557
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,400
1733 in England somewhere and that's why

558
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,039
you're actually sick or they'll say you

559
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,679
drowns they will say like in the 1600s

560
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,159
you

561
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,360
were you were deemed a witch in the

562
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:21,400
1600s and you were put to death by

563
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:23,679
Drowning because nobody knew any answers

564
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,440
right I remember people would come to me

565
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,399
and they'd be like well I've been to

566
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,240
every doctor and now I've been to every

567
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:33,520
every psychic and healer I can find

568
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,600
around the planet and I have some I have

569
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:41,200
some good good leads one lead is I was

570
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:44,000
drowned as a witch in 16 in the 1600s

571
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,960
and because of that that's why I'm sick

572
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,120
and I have all these problems and

573
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,159
everything else and spirit of compassion

574
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:54,480
would say that's not why the person's

575
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:56,200
sick person has real real reasons why

576
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,880
they're sick and those are the answers

577
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,880
you find in the medical medium books

578
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,600
sometimes soul searching will bring

579
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,240
people closer to themselves many times

580
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,799
it will leave them feeling more lost

581
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,000
than ever did you ever go soul searching

582
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,840
and then you feel more lost than ever

583
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,559
did you ever try to find yourself but

584
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,919
yet you feel more lost did that ever

585
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:20,840
happen to you where you're you're going

586
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,039
to try to find yourself right and you

587
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,240
think you're going to find yourself

588
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:26,399
you're trying to find yourself and then

589
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,440
you're like ah I think I found myself I

590
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,520
do I think I found myself but then then

591
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,679
all of a sudden you feel more lost than

592
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,640
ever and then you feel like you're down

593
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,880
a rabbit hole where it's

594
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,360
worse many times it will leave someone

595
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,799
feeling more loss than ever under the GU

596
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,880
of help you may have heard the false

597
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,919
theory that illness is just a cry for

598
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,760
attention did you guys ever hear that

599
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:51,600
the false theory that went around for

600
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,120
decades that medical medium information

601
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,480
had to

602
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,320
disprove did you ever hear that where

603
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,559
it's a cry for help that's why you're

604
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,159
sick you were looking for attention did

605
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,880
you ever hear that one where you were

606
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,360
looking for attention that's why you

607
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
were sick that's another one that has

608
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,640
tortured people for years that medical

609
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,799
medium info had to disprove to help

610
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,200
people they give them answers I can't

611
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,520
tell you how many times I've heard that

612
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,720
like you're just you're just want

613
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,600
attention that's that's why what you're

614
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,399
doing right that's what everybody's told

615
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,679
it just breaks my heart when I even hear

616
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:31,000
that you may have heard that when bad

617
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,960
things happen to us we cause them by

618
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,240
thinking the wrong thoughts did you guys

619
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,840
hear that one bad things are happening

620
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,520
to you you're sick because you caused it

621
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,320
with your by having the wrong thoughts

622
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,880
like by having the wrong thoughts that's

623
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,240
why you're sick you caused your sickness

624
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,559
by thinking the wrong thoughts see these

625
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:54,679
are all made up things made up theories

626
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:57,200
here by Men by men here on the planet

627
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,120
and women here on the planet it's made

628
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,480
of theories and spirit of compassion is

629
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,880
not from here so has Clarity on this

630
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,039
because I can't tell you how many times

631
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,919
I've had to rewire someone because they

632
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,720
were positive they were sick because

633
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,799
they had bad thoughts and that's why

634
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,240
they were sick I've said it before and

635
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:23,399
I'll say it again if you are ill or

636
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:27,960
going through a trial like a divorce or

637
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:29,840
a loss you did not manifest it if you

638
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,240
are are going through a sickness you did

639
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,279
not manifest it if you are going through

640
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,559
some type of feeling of like being

641
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,440
disconnected feeling lost feeling

642
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,799
hopeless and depressed you did not

643
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,279
manifest it if you feel sadness that you

644
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,039
can't explain and you feel like no one

645
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:50,120
understands you and you can't understand

646
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:53,600
yourself you feel and you feel like you

647
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:58,559
lost all trust in yourself you did

648
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:01,679
not manifest that you did not attract it

649
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,120
it is not punishment or payback it's not

650
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,960
Karma if you guys have struggled and you

651
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,240
suffered and something happened to you

652
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,440
along the way whatever you do don't

653
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,640
think it's karma paying you back in this

654
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,640
lifetime if a child is sick you mean to

655
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,000
tell me that child's karma is why that

656
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,000
child is suffering the one thing you'll

657
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,159
find in the medical medium information

658
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,480
is about freeing the brainwashing and

659
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,559
freeing you up of the brainwashing and

660
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,840
mind control that has been out there

661
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,000
forever and that mind control is in the

662
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,320
alternative arts and alternative healing

663
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,919
I'm so sorry to say I really am it

664
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,000
breaks my heart and kills me it's also

665
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,159
in the conventional healing too in the

666
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,720
conventional world that mind control and

667
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,000
brain conditioning is unbelievable

668
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,720
there's a spiritual war out there it

669
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,799
really is and it just controls

670
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,960
people purposely so that those people

671
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,960
can control everybody else it's like

672
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,440
it's

673
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,080
unbelievable you did not attract it it's

674
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,399
not punish or payback it's not your Bad

675
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,440
Karma you have to know you're not sick

676
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,039
because of your karma whatever you do

677
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,200
you can't fall into that you do not

678
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,080
deserve to be sick or unhappy it's not

679
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,559
your fault you didn't manifest it it's

680
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,039
not your fault and it's not Karma I can

681
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,880
promise you

682
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:21,320
that you don't need to travel the world

683
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,080
trying to find yourself I've seen people

684
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,640
who have money travel the world to find

685
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:31,000
themselves and they're still sick Soul

686
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:35,559
healing is about reclaiming who you

687
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,080
are because you are already good enough

688
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:41,480
who you are already means more than you

689
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,320
know you are already good

690
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,760
enough it's just about healing now you

691
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:51,960
are already good enough you deserve to

692
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:55,279
heal you deserve to be happy you deserve

693
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,440
to feel whole your heart serves as the

694
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,039
compass for your actions guiding you to

695
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,760
do the right thing when your soul

696
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,760
becomes

697
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,000
lost when our souls become lost we feel

698
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,640
like we're disconnected we feel like our

699
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
soul is busted up and broken our heart

700
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,000
serves as the compass for our actions it

701
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,159
guides us to do the right thing when our

702
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,519
soul becomes lost our heart matters in

703
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,120
that situation your heart is also a

704
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,320
safety net that can compensate for soul

705
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,840
injuries that means when we get broken

706
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,440
down so hard and we had a really bad

707
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,559
relationship or something happened in

708
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,919
her life our heart Stands Strong this

709
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,440
means you can have a tattered soul and a

710
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:41,240
warm loving heart I can't tell you how

711
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,720
many people that I've met that have the

712
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,279
tattered they've been tattered along the

713
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,120
way but their heart is warm and their

714
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:50,279
heart is loving and their heart is

715
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,720
caring I've been through a lot in my

716
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:54,720
life and I still care and I still want

717
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,000
to help and I still care about people

718
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,559
and love people and I know there's a

719
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,919
whole bunch of people out there they've

720
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,960
been through Helen back and they still

721
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:08,279
have a heart that's warm and loving and

722
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:11,159
they care when your soul suffers losses

723
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,399
a strong heart will get you through with

724
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:17,120
Selfless Love

725
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:20,279
compassion and joy under the soul until

726
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,080
your soul has managed to heal compassion

727
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:24,240
is

728
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:28,880
critical superficial love that's a

729
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,799
matter of the Mind self selfless love

730
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,880
that comes from the heart you guys know

731
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:38,480
about superficial love right The

732
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:42,080
Superficial love love is not

733
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,120
absolute love is not

734
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,159
everything unless compassion is attached

735
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,519
to it that's why you can see somebody

736
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,080
and they'll fall in love with someone

737
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,679
and then they can fall out of love with

738
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,679
someone like what was it was it just a

739
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,360
change of heart a change of mind what

740
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,720
was that how can you be so in love with

741
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,559
someone so in love with them and then

742
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,200
not love them anymore that means that

743
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,200
love had no compassion in there it

744
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,639
wasn't

745
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,760
attached they were

746
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:17,799
separated if you have love for someone

747
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,679
and it's lost that means that the

748
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:24,440
compassion is gone compassion is the

749
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,840
glue to love love isn't enough you have

750
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,440
to have compassion as the glue for love

751
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,919
or love won't stand a chance love won't

752
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,639
hang in there love won't even Last Love

753
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,720
Won't Be Strong Enough Love is just an

754
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:40,159
empty word love is a totally empty word

755
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,000
if compassion isn't intertwined or

756
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,720
attached or somehow involved if you

757
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,679
don't have compassion involved if

758
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,000
compassion's not part of love then love

759
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:54,120
is not strong enough isn't everything

760
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,799
just a lesson we try to learn from it so

761
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,720
we don't get burned by that stove again

762
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,480
but no everything's not not just a

763
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,120
lesson unfortunately it's not it's like

764
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,639
you don't need your arm chopped off to

765
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,639
teach you a lesson is that a lesson I

766
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:14,880
know a lot of war vets that lost their

767
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:17,159
legs I'm intertwined with a lot of vets

768
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,799
I have vets in my family the whole bit

769
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,639
and losing both your legs is not there

770
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,919
to teach you a lesson we can certainly

771
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:26,720
try to grow from it and learn from it

772
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:30,279
but it wasn't done on purpose to teach

773
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,760
us a lesson child abuse isn't there to

774
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:35,639
teach a child a lesson so yeah no things

775
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,480
aren't there for a lesson that's not how

776
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,919
it

777
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,559
works we can try to grow we can try to

778
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:42,440
better ourselves we can try to rise

779
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,399
above it we can try to use tools to rise

780
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,519
above it but it wasn't there to teach a

781
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:52,399
child a lesson child abuse and it wasn't

782
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,720
there for a a soldier who's trying to do

783
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:57,240
something good it wasn't there that

784
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,559
Soldier to lose their legs being killed

785
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,320
isn't lesson either for us to learn

786
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:03,080
abuse of any kind for someone isn't a

787
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,760
lesson for us to learn we're not that's

788
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,720
not a lesson we're not supposed to learn

789
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:13,240
that as a lesson but it

790
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:17,480
happens our soul is strong only God

791
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,599
knows what our soul went through and if

792
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:24,119
and when it was

793
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:27,919
wronged our soul is her life's song

794
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:31,679
walking in the woods it's you and just

795
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:36,520
your soul birds can feel it and they

796
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:41,599
sing a Love Song and your soul sings

797
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:45,879
along our soul is our eternal power a

798
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:49,440
light that can never die out a light

799
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:55,440
that shines bright long after we leave

800
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:59,680
this place our soul can be tall so tall

801
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:04,599
it can Tower there is no wall your soul

802
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,920
can't stand above and see all it stores

803
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,200
all of our

804
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:14,160
experiences deep within itself the soul

805
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,400
can store your faith you once had so no

806
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,640
matter if you lose your faith and path

807
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:25,920
with God it still holds true in your

808
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:29,359
soul thank God it never forgets it never

809
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,000
waivers Soul memory can Outlast

810
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:36,680
mountains as the rain slowly erode the

811
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,640
Rocks the soul still stays true long

812
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,599
after the Earth decays and oceans have

813
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,240
long since been blue the road isn't

814
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,480
always easy for a soul in a physical

815
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:51,800
body enduring life's ups and downs we

816
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,160
step on a nail yell and shout it hurts

817
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:58,560
so much our foot begins to swell but our

818
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:01,680
soul stays strong throughout

819
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:05,960
we break up with a friend it hurts the

820
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,280
heart again the pain can be unbearable

821
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:12,480
but our soul sits alongside of us and

822
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,240
rises above the Betrayal and holds a

823
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,920
candle to rebuild and heal while we once

824
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,520
again restore trust there comes a time

825
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,640
when we realize how much deeper our

826
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,599
light resides and how we are so much

827
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:32,319
more than we ever knew we are more than

828
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:36,319
any Earthly storm we are more than the

829
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:39,520
sun the moon and the stars Earth soul

830
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:42,040
