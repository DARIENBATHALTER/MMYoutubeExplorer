1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,759
How many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health? Chances are, whether

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,559
they show it or not, most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,640
in your life do. And chances are, you're

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,800
one of them. Whether you're dealing with

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,039
anxiety, depression, endometriosis,

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,000
acne, eczema, autoimmune, thyroid, lime,

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,320
brain fog, fatigue, or any other symptom

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,480
or condition, you're far from

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,760
alone. Living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,440
the new normal. So, no more guessing

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,840
games. It's time to get answers. Welcome

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,840
to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,320
Anthony William.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,120
We're talking about the spring and how

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,120
healing the spring can truly be and even

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,000
lifechanging if you know how to utilize

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,760
what the spring offers. The sounds of

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,559
the peepers peeping in the trees. The

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,600
robins as they roll in, land on the

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,479
ground, dance around looking for a worm.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,520
The tadpoles, how they swim around the

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,640
water and then surface looking for a

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,200
gulp of air. And did you know that there

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,640
are powers in the spring that help our

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,479
bodies heal, especially after a long

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,000
winter? And did you know the earthly

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,520
mother knows who you are? Because you

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,079
were born here on the earthly mother.

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,200
Your feet steps on the earthly mother

31
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,600
and she knows everything about you. Get

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,400
ready for this one. Fasten those seat

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,880
belts because there's a lot to know when

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,240
it comes down to your healing. and what

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,680
the earth and the spring has to do with

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
you. It's

37
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,159
springtime. Oh yeah, man. Hey. No. No.

38
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,840
Pull over to here. Yeah. Yeah. The guy's

39
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,960
right

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,439
there. Yeah, man. We're here for spring

41
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,000
break. Is there any parking? Oh, yeah.

42
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,640
No, we have our sticker.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,640
Is this beach uh is this the beach

44
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,319
that's next to the other beach that we

45
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,239
want to go to?

46
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,840
Um

47
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,560
okay. Yeah. What's in our

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,000
car? Uh

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,720
nothing. What's in the cooler? Um

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,319
nothing. Uh we we just have soda in the

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,440
cooler and some uh

52
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:41,160
lunch. Okay. Okay. Thank you.

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,000
Woo! Phew. Let's park over here,

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,760
man. If you're young and you don't have

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,640
anything that's really pressing, like a

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,720
chronic illness, a mystery disease, a

57
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,480
mystery chronic symptom, something

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
that's really holding you back,

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,360
something that's interfering with your

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,640
life. If you're somebody you feel

61
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,120
indestructible and it's time for spring

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,840
break and you could just go on the

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
beach, get a terrible

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,000
sunburn, get exposed to all kinds of

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,800
different chemicals, drink and consume a

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,440
lot of alcohol, get totally shitfaced,

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,840
eat hot dogs, hamburgers, cheeseburgers,

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,920
fried food. You don't have to worry

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,760
about healing. You don't have to try to

70
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,319
heal. You don't have to worry about

71
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,159
getting sick. drinking out of aluminum

72
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,400
cans. They're heating up in the sun.

73
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,480
They're expanding. The liner inside

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,879
cracks. All the aluminum's going into

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,920
your bloodstream. You're sucking the top

76
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,840
of the can. Aluminum's going in your

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,920
mouth. You slather on the worst suntan

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,720
lotion on the planet that has anything

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,200
from 500 to 700 chemicals. Chemicals

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,840
that are terrible for you, toxic, bad

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
for your organs, your brain, your

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,440
bloodstream. You're dowsted in cologne,

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,080
dowsed in perfume. You're in your hotel

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,760
room. You're using the shower there.

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,239
Your feet are on the surface of the

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,920
shower. Toenail fungus is everywhere.

87
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
Somebody else's fungus from their feet

88
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,200
is everywhere. Gets inside your feet,

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,159
inside your toenails. You meet somebody,

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
you don't care about them. You swap

91
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,439
spit. You're getting their herpes

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,560
simplex. You're exposing them to your

93
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,040
herpes simplex. Getting the HPV, you're

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,359
exposing them to HPV. Or maybe

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,759
somebody's on the edge of monucleiosis.

96
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,479
They got exposure from Epstein bar. You

97
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,560
got Epstein bar and it doesn't matter.

98
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,199
Everybody's having fun. It's spring

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,759
break. Nobody needs to heal. Nobody

100
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,960
needs to worry about healing. Maybe down

101
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,880
the road symptoms and conditions develop

102
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,639
and then you're sick and then you're

103
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,960
worried about healing and it's time to

104
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,759
heal and that happens, but for the

105
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,919
moment nobody cares. And that's the

106
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,320
spring for a lot of people. You just

107
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,360
don't care about healing. But if you're

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,759
somebody that has a condition, a

109
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,600
symptom, mystery illness, something's

110
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,440
going on in your life, you're working on

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
your healing process, and maybe you're

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,120
somebody that's been sick for 20 years,

113
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,160
10 years, or even a year, you can use

114
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,520
spring to heal. You can use the spring

115
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,080
to move forward and actually catapult

116
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,520
yourself with your healing process.

117
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,560
There are tools in nature and you don't

118
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,160
have to do much. And the earthly mother

119
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,600
provides these tools of nature so we can

120
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,479
utilize them and work on our healing

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,840
process. As unforgiving as the earth can

122
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:31,680
be, as terrible as the earth can be,

123
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,560
nature walking on a path somewhere in

124
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,280
Costa Rica, accidentally stepping on a

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,080
fertilance snake, getting bitten, you're

126
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,440
in a shed in South

127
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,680
Carolina, you don't see what's behind

128
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,520
something you're grabbing off the shelf.

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,600
There's a black widow spider, a round

130
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,639
body with a red patch underneath its

131
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,720
belly, bites you on the finger. Maybe

132
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,880
you're somebody in Australia. You're

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,080
walking down a path near a water basin

134
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,000
or waterway. Crocodile jumps out at you.

135
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,520
Or maybe you're down in Florida and

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,600
you're by a pond. An alligator crawls up

137
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
really quick, gets you in the foot,

138
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,000
drags you on down into the water. Or you

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,240
can be in

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,680
Hawaii and there's an area where people

141
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,919
have dared to jump off a cliff into the

142
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,319
ocean. It's a common place people go.

143
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,080
Many people who are really good swimmers

144
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,000
and jumpers and divers take the plunge

145
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,880
and you decide to take that plunge, but

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,840
there's an unforgiving wave rolling in

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,400
at the wrong time, wrong place, some

148
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,720
kind of upsurge of the ocean and it all

149
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,880
goes wrong. The earthly mother has

150
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,440
endless pitfalls. It has dangerous

151
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,759
areas, dangerous aspects of nature.

152
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,360
Poisonous snakes, poisonous frogs,

153
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:56,000
poisonous spiders, big grizzly bears,

154
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:59,120
angry wolves. Also, ice that cracks,

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,479
people fall through. Unpredictable forms

156
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,280
of nature everywhere. And then there's

157
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,440
predictable forms of nature, the earthly

158
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:13,039
mother and her healing powers. So, let's

159
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,160
get down to it. As winter is passing and

160
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,199
spring is coming closer, our bodies know

161
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,840
this. They're aware of this. And so is

162
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,400
the earthly mother. She's aware that

163
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,960
your body is aware of this. So, a

164
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,720
synchronicity occurs. Something inside

165
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,560
of our bodies ignites like a seed.

166
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,960
that's sensing its birth. Like a seed

167
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,479
that's about to sprout. There's energy

168
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,199
involved like the buds that have been

169
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:48,039
dormant on an apple tree waiting to

170
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:51,840
swell and burst open and flower. The

171
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:55,039
buds beginning to burst. All that power

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,000
behind it. A healing igniter for the

173
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,400
body is to get that synchronicity to

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,919
what's happening in spring. allowing

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,919
your body to connect to the earthly

176
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:11,039
mother and how life just comes to life.

177
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,280
Now, our bodies are alive all year long,

178
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,400
not just during the spring. Our hearts

179
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,960
are beating all year long, every day,

180
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,800
every hour, every minute. But when every

181
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,000
spring comes, we have a little bit of an

182
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,879
extra chance to spark up, to ignite our

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,120
healing, to strengthen. Our bodies are

184
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,599
especially in tuned with nature during

185
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,880
the springtime. And it's about making

186
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,279
that connection consciously knowing that

187
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,919
our bodies have this burst of extra

188
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,560
healing at this time of year. Knowing

189
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,560
this alone can make all the difference.

190
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,480
Now, this doesn't mean we don't heal all

191
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,880
different times of the year. The

192
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,760
summertime, the fall, the winter, we do

193
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,399
heal. Our bodies do heal. When we have

194
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,480
chronic illness, every day counts. Every

195
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,800
hour counts, every minute counts. But

196
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,920
the spring offers something a little

197
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,240
different. It offers this ignition that

198
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,640
doesn't happen in other months. Now,

199
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,959
during the winter months, we're not

200
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,320
turtles under the ice and we're not

201
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:15,680
sleeping bears in their dens. And we're

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,000
not bats in their caves. Our bodies are

203
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,880
not truly hibernating. That's not what

204
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,160
it is. And then we're breaking the

205
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,000
hibernation. But at the same time, it

206
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,200
doesn't mean our body systems aren't

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,440
tuned in to the sleeping bears and the

208
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,760
sleeping bats and the caves and the

209
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
turtles underneath the ice. Our physical

210
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,640
bodies are tuned in. And our physical

211
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,240
bodies are tuned in to the daffodils,

212
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,720
the daisies, the crocuses that are

213
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,360
underneath the snow. And even though our

214
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,839
bodies aren't frozen, they're not frozen

215
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,920
in one place. They're not frozen like

216
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,000
the earth because it was really cold out

217
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,279
through the winter. Our bodies are not

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,680
frozen like ice on a lake or a pond or a

219
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,959
river. But yet our bodies are in tune

220
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,640
and know about the frozen. Our bodies

221
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,920
know about the frozen ice, the frozen

222
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,920
earth, the frozen ground we walk on. So

223
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,800
when it all starts changing, all starts

224
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,680
melting, shifting, everything starts to

225
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,480
alter. Our bodies are in tune. But it's

226
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,720
now about getting our consciousness

227
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,519
aligned with our bodies to help it

228
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,560
along, to help that connection along, to

229
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,880
help that synchronicity into spring,

230
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,360
that driving, powerful, energetic,

231
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,640
earthly mother force, and to connect

232
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,600
with that to help your healing process.

233
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,959
Now, it's easy to let spring fly by.

234
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,399
Spring go by really quick, snap of a

235
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:43,079
finger, in which you don't even see

236
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,519
spring at all. happens to so many

237
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:48,079
people, more than you think, more than

238
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,360
you know, where they only see spring for

239
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,519
a second or get a whiff of it, a smell

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,320
in the air. They're too busy. They got a

241
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,640
lot going on. Springtime can fly by so

242
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,040
fast it happened yesterday. And what

243
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,519
does that mean for our bodies? Does that

244
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,360
mean our bodies had a burst of healing?

245
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,240
A healing ignition occurred? that

246
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,160
magical incredible strength of spring

247
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,959
went through you and you had this

248
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,560
healing. Not necessarily. You might have

249
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,640
had a little bit. There might have been

250
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,880
some there that you weren't aware of.

251
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,079
But it's that connection. It's making

252
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,560
that conscious connection to spring and

253
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,480
really absorbing it and seeing it for

254
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,959
what it is. Making that connection to

255
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,040
the earthly mother that really sparks

256
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,680
that healing, really creates that

257
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,000
ignition. It's not just living your life

258
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,320
and it magically happens. You'll get

259
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,920
some of it. You'll get some of spring's

260
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,839
power. You'll get some of what spring

261
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
has to offer if you're not paying

262
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,839
attention at all and you're just going

263
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,360
through life super busy doing your

264
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,600
thing. You'll get a spark, but nothing

265
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,839
like you can get when you're focused,

266
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,399
when you know what's happening, when you

267
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,200
utilize nature in a certain way, when

268
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,519
you really absorb spring. So, how do we

269
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,839
make the best of spring to ignite our

270
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,839
healing process? Let's start with the

271
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,639
first thing. Being aware, being

272
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,040
conscious when the trees wake up. Being

273
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,680
there when the trees wake up. It could

274
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,720
just be one tree somewhere in your yard

275
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,120
or near your apartment or in the park

276
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:30,240
and you see it. Watching the buds swell

277
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,160
and seeing the leaves come out. Not

278
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,639
just, ooh, I saw a tree. A month later,

279
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,680
oh, the leaves are out, seeing the

280
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,480
process, witnessing it, being aware of

281
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,519
it, connecting to it. And if you have

282
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,079
the ability to touch a branch, to walk

283
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,120
over to a tree with lowhanging branches

284
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,279
that are in this early stage, or a shrub

285
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,320
or a bush of some kind because you can't

286
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,680
reach a branch, go ahead and do that.

287
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,560
Grab onto that branch. Feel those buds.

288
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,000
See those leaves starting to form. And

289
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,279
do it intermittently. Do it once a day.

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,320
Do it once every three days. Be a part

291
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,560
of it. Be a part of the trees process.

292
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,120
And if this is all you can do out of all

293
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,200
the different tools, it's powerful and

294
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,880
it's that helpful. Making that

295
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,360
connection alone can ignite healing

296
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,839
because your body wants to heal,

297
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,760
especially in the spring. Now keep in

298
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,160
mind that the earthly mother knows your

299
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,519
every step. So when you walk on the

300
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,760
earth, every single footprint, every

301
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,839
step you make, the earthly mother is

302
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,959
wise to it, understands it, knows you're

303
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,200
on her earth. The earthly mother is

304
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,200
aware of you. And you don't have to be

305
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,000
barefoot for the earthly mother to know

306
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,240
who you are, to know your energy, to

307
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,399
know your life force. These healing

308
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,880
tools work whether you're wearing boots,

309
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,320
sneakers, sandals, flip flops, or

310
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,800
anything else that you wear on your

311
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,800
feet. This isn't about the grounding

312
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,279
theory where you have to be barefoot on

313
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,079
the earth and that heals you or grounds

314
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,360
you. This is far more advanced than

315
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,040
that. This supersedes that. You can have

316
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,760
anything on your feet and it won't

317
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,079
matter. This is about your hands, your

318
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,440
eyes, and your consciousness. And your

319
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,720
physical body, its ignition to spring

320
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,120
and propelling it forward into healing.

321
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,279
And this works if you're on mattress

322
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,680
island. And this works if you're in the

323
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,519
house and looking out the window. This

324
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,920
works if you're in your apartment and

325
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,600
looking out the window or from a

326
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,240
hospital room and looking out the

327
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,279
window. the powerful aspect of spring

328
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,279
and what it does for the healing happens

329
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,079
and you don't even have to be outside on

330
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,880
the earth or walking or walking to a

331
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,800
tree or even touching a tree. You can do

332
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,079
the process and touch the branches and

333
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,279
see it and it's powerful. But the power

334
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,440
in this is also just being aware, having

335
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,160
that conscious connection and having

336
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,120
that knowing that it is the spring and

337
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,720
your body feels it and sees it just like

338
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,920
a bunch of tadpoles that are teeming in

339
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,920
life in a little bit of water. So

340
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,320
connecting to a tree that's waking up

341
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,600
during the springtime is one of the most

342
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,480
powerful tools. And being able to walk

343
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,519
across the yard or the earth or a park

344
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:35,279
or the ground somewhere up to a shrub or

345
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:39,199
a tree or a bush and holding on to that

346
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,440
stem, that branch helps to awaken,

347
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,079
creating that

348
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,160
ignition, that springtime healing that

349
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,040
our bodies have been waiting for all

350
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,600
year. Watching the trees leaf out at all

351
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,399
the different stages is profound,

352
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,360
powerful healing tool. all on its own.

353
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,560
Being aware, being in the moment, seeing

354
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,360
it happen, watching the different stages

355
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,199
and the different colors of the leaves,

356
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,839
seeing the colors be red and pink,

357
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,560
eventually light green and then dark

358
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:16,079
green. All the different stages of

359
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,720
colors that the leaves create have a

360
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,360
truly profound effect not only on the

361
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,000
body, the physical body and the healing

362
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,880
and the ignition, but also on the mind,

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,279
the consciousness and for mental health,

364
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,920
strengthening mental health. And as you

365
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,880
watch each stage, each phase of the

366
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,360
leaves forming, changing colors, getting

367
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:43,160
larger, growing, you're reducing PTSD.

368
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,440
You're reducing old wounds, injuries,

369
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,279
stress, problems that have happened in

370
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,160
your life, betrayal, losses, struggles

371
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,880
start to diminish. At least the injuries

372
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,160
involved from those are starting to

373
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,920
diminish. You're replacing bad thoughts,

374
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,759
bad memories, bad situations,

375
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,079
confrontation. You're replacing it with

376
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,520
things from the earthly mother that help

377
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,079
us heal, change our frequency. alter our

378
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,039
state of being, our state of mind.

379
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,839
People with PTSD and OCD can benefit

380
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,480
greatly from this process alone of what

381
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,839
spring has to offer. When trees awaken

382
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,039
in the spring, they're at their

383
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,559
strongest point. Connect with that and

384
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,679
know that you're at your strongest

385
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,000
point. Even if you're chronically sick

386
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,520
or you've been through so much or your

387
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,640
symptoms feel daunting and pressing and

388
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,720
very hard to live with and you're

389
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,080
struggling, see yourself at your

390
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,720
strongest point. It's spring and you're

391
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,200
at your strongest point just like those

392
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,679
trees are. So now let's talk about the

393
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,919
birds a little bit. Maybe you have

394
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,760
robins come by where you live on the

395
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,600
planet and maybe you don't and you have

396
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,320
another bird

397
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
But if there's another bird and it's

398
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,919
springtime and those birds are coming

399
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,480
through, think about them when I talk

400
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,160
about the robins. When the robins come

401
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,600
to town, you know it's

402
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,840
springtime. Sometimes the robins come a

403
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,600
little bit earlier. Sometimes they come

404
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,919
what seems to be a little bit later. And

405
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,880
sometimes they come in packs. They come

406
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,160
really early and then they come a little

407
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,480
later. Seeing a robin can be a spiritual

408
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,000
experience. It is a spiritual

409
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,720
experience. Seeing a robin can be a

410
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,440
religious experience and can be a

411
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,440
powerful rewiring tool. But keep in

412
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,799
mind, you could see something but still

413
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,440
be blind. Your eyes can be open, but you

414
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,080
can be blind to see. And that happens in

415
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,880
the springtime. Not because somebody's a

416
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,960
bad person, not because they don't want

417
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:58,400
to see something, because life just runs

418
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,120
us down and it runs us ragged and it

419
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,600
keeps us busy and we're battling all

420
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,360
kinds of different battles. We're moving

421
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,640
along. We're trying to work. we're

422
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,039
trying to live and watching a robin and

423
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,760
really seeing that robin and seeing what

424
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,080
it's doing and understanding that robin

425
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,880
and understanding how spring and the

426
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,280
robin connect to you is just something

427
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,720
that may not be possible for so many.

428
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,840
But if you have the opportunity and you

429
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:31,160
do see a robin for what it is and feel

430
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,520
that spiritual connection, it could be

431
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,559
lifealtering, especially during a

432
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,840
springtime healing process. The robins

433
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,559
roll in and you'll notice they're very

434
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,960
happy. You can see it. There's joy in

435
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,919
that robin. There's joy on the robin's

436
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,240
face if you can just catch a glimpse.

437
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,760
They hop around on the ground. They're

438
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,760
looking for food. Sure, survival, but at

439
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,360
the same time, they're living their

440
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,679
life. They're happy doing it. They have

441
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,400
energy. In fact, they're at their most

442
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,160
powerful in this moment. They know it's

443
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,360
spring. And that means everything to the

444
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:14,799
robin. A robin exhibits freedom. Try to

445
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,919
get a hold of that. Grab a hold of that.

446
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,720
When you're sitting there and you're

447
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,160
watching that robin dance around, move

448
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,360
around, look for a worm, having that joy

449
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,080
in its heart. Yes, joy in its heart.

450
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,120
Connect to that. Connect to the freedom

451
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,159
the robin has. And when you do, then

452
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,080
your eyes are open and you can see your

453
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:41,120
body can start increasing its healing

454
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,520
abilities, its healing powers. The

455
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,320
ignition occurs. This is all part of the

456
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,720
springtime healing ignition. Your

457
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,559
ability to increase your healing during

458
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,919
the spring. Since we're talking about

459
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,200
the robins, let's talk about the

460
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,840
earthworms. Have you ever walked through

461
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,919
a park in the morning or through a

462
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,400
grassy yard or a grassy null and saw

463
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,159
these little tiny piles, like little

464
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,480
tiny volcanoes, but they're not

465
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,799
volcanoes. Little tiny piles of dirt.

466
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,039
They're just sitting there and you see a

467
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,919
lot of them. You see one here, one

468
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,400
there, one here, one there. Looks like

469
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,720
fresh dirt that was pushed to the

470
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,360
surface. And you see these in the spring

471
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,520
mostly. Sometimes in the fall, too, but

472
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,159
you see them mostly in the spring. These

473
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,960
are the nightcrawlers, the earthworms.

474
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,480
They were asleep all winter as well,

475
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,440
frozen in a deep state. And then as the

476
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,000
ground defrosted, they came to life and

477
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,159
they started to get active. And this is

478
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,559
during their mating season. If you came

479
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,679
out with a flashlight in the early hours

480
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,080
of the morning on just the right week or

481
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,640
the right morning, just the right time

482
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:58,159
in spring, and you turn that flashlight

483
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,720
on in a park or a yard or an old

484
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,120
baseball field somewhere or some type of

485
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
grassy null, you'll see all the

486
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,960
nightcrawlers out. They're going to be

487
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,960
on top of the ground. And these

488
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,360
nightcrawlers are a delicacy for the

489
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,679
robins. The robins try to get there

490
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,840
early enough before the night crawlers

491
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,520
before the earthworms go back into the

492
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,440
earth. And they're quick when they go

493
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,760
back into the earth. It's hard to catch

494
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,000
them. They're fast. Just like when

495
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,760
you're walking on the earth, the earthly

496
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,679
mother detects you, can feel you, knows

497
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,159
who you are. Just like the earthly

498
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,799
mother knows the nightcrawlers, she can

499
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,720
feel them crawl through the earth. They

500
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,039
are a sign of the spring. And those

501
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,320
earthworms, those nightcrawlers are in

502
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,240
full power. They have the most strength.

503
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,240
They're like an early chute coming out

504
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,720
of the ground, an early sprout coming

505
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,039
up. They're like a plant that's just

506
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,960
starting to bud. They're like a tree

507
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,200
that's just starting to bud. The

508
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,520
strength is in that earthworm at that

509
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,919
moment. the most strength. It's

510
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,799
springtime strength. The earthworm has

511
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,039
been waiting all winter for this moment.

512
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,440
And if you take a walk and you see these

513
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,240
little mounds of dirt, these little

514
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,559
hills of dirt, the size of a quarter,

515
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,679
size of a half dollar, the size of a

516
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,640
dime, and you just look at them, it

517
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,280
helps to ignite healing inside the body.

518
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,760
And if you kneel down to the ground and

519
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,799
you take your hand and your fingers and

520
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,280
you touch the dirt that's on the surface

521
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,600
where those worms came up and then went

522
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,159
back into the earth and you touch that

523
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,360
dirt and you feel it with your fingers.

524
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,159
It's going to be very rich soil,

525
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,400
extremely rich. And you can sense it and

526
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,880
you can feel it with your fingers. And

527
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,280
that connection right there alone does

528
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,799
something in the body. Energy that's in

529
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,559
that dirt is fresh from those powerful

530
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:55,200
earthworms. And that energy vibrates

531
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,480
through the hand and into the body. Our

532
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,039
bodies sense everything spring. And this

533
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,240
alone, if given the chance to do this,

534
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:07,919
is a powerful healing ignition. And our

535
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,720
body systems can sense this energy and

536
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,760
take it in, absorb it fast. And

537
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,480
grounding occurs holding that little bit

538
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,279
of soil that came from the worm that

539
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,000
came up from the worm. That very little

540
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,240
bit of soil in between your fingers or

541
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,799
placed into the palm of your hand can

542
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,720
ground you more than walking barefoot in

543
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,720
the grass during the middle of the

544
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,960
summer. If you ever get a chance, you

545
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,480
can try this healing tool. So, let's

546
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,760
talk about the peepers. The spring

547
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,840
peepers. Those sounds you hear during

548
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,159
the springtime. Maybe you're somewhere

549
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,480
on the planet and you're not near a lot

550
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,640
of peepers. Or maybe you hear a peeper,

551
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,080
but you never knew it was a peeper.

552
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,880
Maybe you heard a sound and you didn't

553
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,760
know it was a tiny tiny tree frog or

554
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,840
even a bush frog. But they're out there

555
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,400
and they make their noise, especially

556
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,799
during the spring. Spring peepers tend

557
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,679
to get louder right before it starts to

558
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,679
rain or begins to rain. Sometimes you

559
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,080
hear them at night, sometimes you hear

560
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,799
them at dusk, sometimes you hear them at

561
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,080
dawn. It all depends on where you are.

562
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,559
But peepers tend to squeak the loudest

563
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,880
when it's spring. They're the happiest

564
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,840
when it's spring. They've been waiting

565
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,919
all winter long. When springtime comes

566
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,240
and they spring to life, they have an

567
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,679
energy. They have a sound. And that

568
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,320
sound goes into your ears. It vibrates

569
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,760
throughout your body. That sound is a

570
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,000
spring healing sound. If you choose it

571
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:42,559
to be, if you partake in the peeper

572
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,520
sounds, those spring peeper sounds are

573
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,720
parts of a spring's fleeting moments.

574
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,760
The frequency to a peeper is similar to

575
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,679
a cricket, though not the same thing,

576
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,120
and they do slightly different things

577
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,600
when it comes down to the healing

578
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:02,799
process. The peeper is the spring. The

579
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,039
cricket is the fall. It's a very healing

580
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,279
sound the cricket makes. I've talked

581
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,880
about it before. I'm going to talk about

582
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,919
it again. But the peeper is the spring

583
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,840
and that frequency resonates to every

584
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,760
single neuron and brain cell,

585
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,960
neurotransmitter, electrical impulses,

586
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,200
gal cells, cranial nerves, and the brain

587
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,919
stem. And when the spring peepers

588
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,480
release this frequency, when they emit

589
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,679
this sound and this noise, that sound

590
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,720
and noise has spring power behind it and

591
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,600
refreshes the mind, the consciousness

592
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,200
and helps to restore thought. If you're

593
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,279
somebody and you're walking on a trail

594
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,960
or you're walking in your yard or you're

595
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,039
somewhere outside walking down a

596
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,679
sidewalk of a street and it's around

597
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,440
dawn and you hear the spring peepers and

598
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,840
it's springtime, they will keep peeping.

599
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,159
They will. Unless you get so close to

600
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,919
them that they think they're in danger

601
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,760
where you're a foot away and you're

602
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,000
about to hit the branch, they'll stop

603
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,320
peeping. But for the most part, they

604
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,200
will keep on making their spring peeping

605
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:13,520
noises. But if you were an alien from

606
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,000
another planet, a Sasquatch or a bear or

607
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,640
some other creature that was placed on

608
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,159
this earth by aliens, the peeper will

609
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,880
stop peeping. Instantly stop peeping and

610
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,840
all will be quiet. The frequency that

611
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,039
admits from peepers. The noise, the

612
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,279
sound resonates to the human body. It

613
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,600
resonates to the human consciousness.

614
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,360
And peepers know this. It's been

615
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,200
instilled in the peeper from the

616
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,440
beginning. And the earthly mother knows

617
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,799
this as well. The frequency and the

618
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,600
sound of a peeper during the spring is

619
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,159
extremely healing to the mind and body

620
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,240
of a human being. Let's move on to the

621
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:57,120
next tool. Spring air. The air, the air

622
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,600
we breathe. When you step outside and

623
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,320
you take a deep breath and you can smell

624
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,559
that spring air. Now, when you think

625
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,200
about it, sure, everybody smells that

626
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,320
air because they breathe that air. It's

627
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,080
the spring. So, that's a tool. That's a

628
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,360
tool where everybody's walking around

629
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,080
and it's springtime and they're

630
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,000
breathing that air so it works. It's not

631
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,520
how it works. There's something

632
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,360
different about that air when you're

633
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:26,000
breathing it in as a tool, as a therapy.

634
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,440
It's not about breath work. It's about

635
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,480
knowing what you're smelling. It's about

636
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,640
identifying spring in that air with

637
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,720
every breath. When you breathe in

638
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,840
through your nose, you can smell the

639
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,840
air. You can smell the sun hitting the

640
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,760
earth. You can smell the birds making a

641
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,679
nest. Early enough in spring, you can

642
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,240
smell the ice melting on the rivers. You

643
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,559
can smell flowers blossoming. You can

644
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,440
smell the grass sprouting up. You can

645
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,000
smell the decaying leaves from the fall

646
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,240
working its way into the earth. And most

647
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,799
people focus on pollen because they got

648
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,399
allergies. They're pollen sensitive. So,

649
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,640
they're worried about the pollen in the

650
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,039
spring. And the springtime is their

651
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,360
greatest hell for that reason. But as

652
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:17,679
bad as pollen can irritate a lot of

653
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,559
people, it's also healing. Pollen is a

654
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,039
powerful healing tool on the body. When

655
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,360
we breathe it in, even if we're

656
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,320
sensitive and have allergies to pollen,

657
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,600
it's causing problems. It's also helping

658
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,159
us heal. It's igniting a healing, a deep

659
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,039
healing. At the same time, anytime we

660
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,679
breathe in pollen, we gain strength in

661
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:43,200
other areas of the body. Our life force

662
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,520
strengthens. Even if our sinuses don't

663
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,159
feel like they are or our ears and

664
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,799
sinuses feel clogged up or our nose is

665
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,919
running or we have headaches from it,

666
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:57,120
our internal life force, the life force

667
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,159
of our human body, our existence, our

668
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,399
physical existence, strengthens as we're

669
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,640
breathing in the pollen. So, as much as

670
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,440
it feels like the pollen is hurting us,

671
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,919
it's strengthening our life force, our

672
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,720
internal life force. And when we have

673
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,880
pollen problems, it's usually a reminder

674
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,840
that something else is wrong. It's a

675
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:23,840
pointer because pollen is a natural

676
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,760
earthly occurrence. It's nature. But

677
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,840
it's nature that's not supposed to make

678
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,720
us sick. We're not supposed to be

679
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,600
irritable. We're not supposed to get

680
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,679
inflamed. We're not supposed to have

681
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,760
congestion because of it. We're not

682
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,559
supposed to have an allergic reaction to

683
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,679
pollen. But yet so many do because the

684
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,720
pollen is a healer. It's pointing out

685
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,720
problems. It's a problem finder. So that

686
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,919
means there's other things going on like

687
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,159
allergies to dairy, allergies to eggs,

688
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,480
allergies to other foods that aren't

689
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,039
good for someone that are creating a

690
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,200
mucous barrier. And that mucus barrier

691
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,159
gets triggered by the healing properties

692
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,399
of breathing in pollen. But overall,

693
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,360
when you're aware of it and you know

694
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:10,279
you're breathing in pollen, you're

695
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,880
smelling pollen from the trees, the

696
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:18,240
flowers, the springtime, it is a healer.

697
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,399
It is an igniter. When springtime comes

698
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,320
and everything is sprouting out there,

699
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,559
everything is budding, everything is

700
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,480
rebirthing, everything is

701
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:30,559
awakening, our body starts to do the

702
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,480
same thing. So if we're sick with

703
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,320
chronic illness, disease, if we have

704
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,519
symptoms, aches and pains and tingles

705
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:43,360
and numbness, dizziness, ringing in the

706
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:47,279
ears, popping in the ears, vertigo,

707
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,440
tremors, ticks, spasms, bad migraines,

708
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,960
skin conditions, eczema, psoriasis,

709
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,240
dermatitis, vitiligo, back pain, leg

710
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,480
pain, restless leg syndrome, feet pain,

711
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,200
neck pain, constant reoccurring

712
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,600
infection, UTI, kidney infections,

713
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,640
bladder infections, severe chronic

714
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,399
fatigue syndrome, chronic fatigue, brain

715
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,519
fog, and any kind of autoimmune

716
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:15,039
condition, and hundreds of other

717
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:18,080
symptoms. The spring is not your enemy.

718
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,840
The spring is your friend. And the

719
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,760
spring offers something very powerful to

720
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,519
help you rebirth, to help you heal. It's

721
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,080
in addition to all the other good things

722
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,519
you're doing. You could be somebody and

723
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,360
you're doing some great things for your

724
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,360
health. You're eating good. You're

725
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,480
taking care of yourself. You want to get

726
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,799
better. You want to improve. And the

727
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,880
springtime gives us that lift. It

728
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,440
increases our chances and possibilities

729
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,000
to heal quicker. And in order to do

730
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,159
that, we got to catch the wave. We got

731
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,080
to catch the spring wave. We have to

732
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,559
feel it. We have to sense it. We have to

733
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,720
see it. We have to partake in it. and we

734
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:00,240
can't let it slip by because we're too

735
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,279
busy and it's gone. Our blood resonates

736
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,559
to a stream that's melting and becoming

737
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:11,039
alive again and teeming with life. And

738
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:13,519
our skin resonates to the rain hitting

739
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,799
rocks and boulders and dripping off of

740
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:21,039
them. And our organs resonate and

741
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:24,159
connect to buds bursting on branches and

742
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,559
flowers blooming. a rebirththing for all

743
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,360
the plants coming up from the earth and

744
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,000
the grass. Our organs are rebirthing new

745
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,799
cells. Cells that are dying, cells that

746
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,519
are restoring and rebirththing. And our

747
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,240
endocrine systems resonate to the sun's

748
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,840
shifting, getting higher up in the sky

749
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,760
and that changing light. All of this

750
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,880
says spring is here. All of this says

751
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,440
your body can heal. All of this is

752
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,360
connected to the earthly mother and your

753
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,320
body surviving and thriving and

754
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,320
revitalizing. If you're somebody with a

you, man. Spring break is amazing. I

781
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,839
worked so hard this semester, man. Oh,

782
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,839
man. Hey, can you grab me another beer

783
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,680
out of the cooler? Wow, look at this.

784
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:10,160
The beach is so nice. Oh, wait. Look

785
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,599
out, sir. What's in the cooler? Open the

786
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,359
cooler, please. Sir, open the cooler. I

787
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,440
don't have nothing in here, man. I'm not

788
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,320
doing anything. I just got a sandwich

789
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,440
and some sodas. I'm not littering or

790
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:29,079
doing anything. Sir, open up the cooler

791
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:34,560
now. It's time to heal. Time to move

792
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:38,560
forward. My body can. The springtime

793
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,680
will push this and move me forward. I

794
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,680
know I can do this. It just takes a

795
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,640
helping

796
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,440
hand. The spring is here. I feel my

797
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,160
healing is

798
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:55,920
near. I thought I saw a

799
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,599
deer out the window out there. It will

800
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,960
be

801
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:04,880
okay. I know I'm healing

802
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:07,280
anyway. I'm not straying. I'm on a wave.

803
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm not complaining.

804
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,400
I know in due time I will be

805
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,640
strong. I will be

806
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,280
fine. I can

807
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:23,640
see the earthly mother is looking out

808
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,720
for me. I can hear all her

809
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,640
sounds. They're out

810
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:33,880
there. Let me grab a chair, sit

811
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,960
outside, smell the air. I'm aware that

812
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:40,480
spring be thy

813
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:44,400
healer. God is my maker. God knows I've

814
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:48,480
had it hard and have been shaken along

815
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,880
the way, but I'm not weak. God knows

816
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,599
there's nothing that will break me. And

817
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,800
the earthly mothers created spring. And

818
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:00,720
God won't forsake me. Feel it in your

819
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,839
blood. Don't lose touch.

820
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:07,280
Spring is in everyone's neighborhood.

821
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,560
And remember this, spring is a tool and

822
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,880
nothing's going to stop you from

823
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,440
healing. It's a tool that's there for

824
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,680
the taking. And there's an ancient

825
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,960
connection you have with the spring.

826
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,400
lifetimes ago, many lifetimes before

827
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,079
this new rain, before this new spring.

828
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,960
Your eyes are open, your heart is

829
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:31,839
beating, your body is connecting to God

830
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,520
and the earthly mother springing. You

831
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:40,200
can heal to spring in all springs. Your

832
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,200
body and soul will be singing.

833
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,880
original published medical medium

834
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,440
information gets stolen and poached by

835
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,280
podcast doctors, social media doctors,

836
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,119
influencers, and medical clinics.

837
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,880
Medical medium information has never yet

838
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,040
been proven wrong by medical science and

839
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,720
research. Instead, the opposite. only

840
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,560
proven right and then taken from medical

841
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,240
medium published material and used in

842
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,320
the conventional and alternative health

843
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,240
communities. Medical medium information

844
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,760
continually sets the stage for medical

845
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,760
science to understand chronic illness

846
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,680
better. If you choose to share or use

847

others who see and learn of this

852
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,000
information have a chance to know where

853
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,760
it all originates to give them an

854
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,520
opportunity to heal so they don't end up

855
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,440
losing years of their life searching for

856
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,359
answers like so many have before them.

857
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,280
The medical medium information here on

858
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,200
this podcast doesn't come from broken

859
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,200
science, interest groups, medical

860
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,920
funding with strings attached, botched

861
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,079
research, lobbyists, internal kickbacks,

862
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,079
persuaded belief systems, private panels

863
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,839
of influencers, health field payoffs,

864
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,599
trendy traps, or gathered bits and

865
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,599
pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because

866
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,440
chronic illness is exploding like never

867
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,359
before in our modern-day history, it

868
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,200
takes a greater force than us down here.

869
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,960
It takes a helping hand from above.

870
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,560
Medical medium information has street

871
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,839
cred. It's an organic movement of

872
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,599
countless people around the world

873
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,359
healing more healing stories of real

874
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,520
people not being paid to tell their

875
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,119
life-changing experiences of rising out

876
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,280
of the ashes of sickness and entering

877
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,880
into the light of full recovery, getting

878
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,480
their lives back, and finally healing

879
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,920
when nothing else in the world of health

880
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,920
could move the needle and get them

881
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,320
better. The information on this podcast

882
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,160
is not man-made. It comes from above,

883
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,079
from a higher source. Whatever you

884
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,000
believe in, whether God, the universe,

885
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,280
the light, or the creator, or if you

886
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,640
believe in nothing at all, that we're

887
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,320
just floating through space together on

888
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,160
this rock, know that the information you

889
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,920
hear on this podcast is separate from

890
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,520
all the other noise out there. It comes

891
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,079
from a different place. A pure

892
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,119
