not found anywhere else and is decades

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,960
ahead of what's out there now as I've

11
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,600
always said who has 10 or 20 years or 30

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,160
years to wait for answers and I've run

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,680
into a lot of people over the years that

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,840
are like you know what I've had this for

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,920
20 years I've had this problem for 20

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,800
years and it just didn't have any

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,760
answers to know really what to do or

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,879
what's going on and uh and who wants to

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,559
wait that long I mean people when they

20
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,760
get something going on I mean you know

21
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,760
and even if it's for a week even if it's

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,760
for two weeks even if it's a symptom for

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,320
a month I mean whoo and and I've seen

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,040
people where all of a sudden they got

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,920
something going on and it's it's just

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,920
like it's like hey I I can't live my

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,799
life or or if they're living their life

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,759
they just can't stand a symptom or some

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,680
kind of condition absolutely I mean

30
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,280
without a doubt it's it's really hard

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,479
it's really hard um you know and and it

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,240
makes things difficult today we're

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,240
talking about the gallbladder the

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,520
gallbladder wo gallbladder spasms things

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,360
like that all kinds of gall stuff gall

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,680
stone

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,399
hey you know and maybe you don't have a

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,880
gallbladder maybe your gallbladder was

39
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,240
taken out maybe it was

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,600
removed maybe it was removed you know

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,159
gallbladders are funny and uh and we we

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,719
need to talk about them that's the whole

43
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,320
thing that that's what we want to do I

44
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:51,079
think I think you know I should have

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,520
done a gallbladder show a long time ago

46
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,640
without a doubt I should have done one

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,880
you know I talk about research and

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,479
science a lot and in in the sense that

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,799
you know in chronic illness I feel like

50
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,280
it's it's fallen behind it actually was

51
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,799
never caught up to begin with all the

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,479
way from the start and and um you know

53
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,480
and I say that a lot I say that a lot

54
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,440
when it comes down to chronic illness

55
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,720
but when it comes down to a good surgeon

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,200
removing a gallbladder that's got

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,440
infected that became

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,480
infected you know or or

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,959
spasming so bad and the person is just

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,519
suffering and you know or or you know a

61
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,400
gallbladder that that's basically going

62
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,280
to

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,800
rupture and hey and and we you you you

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
find a good surgeon and that's where

65
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,840
research and science is paid off that's

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,640
where it's paid off right there and um

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,840
so you know I appreciate that I

68
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,800
appreciate that and I respect that

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,920
highly respect that highly appreciate

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,920
that um but when it comes down to

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,440
chronic illness in general all kinds of

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,720
different ways I mean you know science

73
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,840
and research hasn't gotten there

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,120
including the production of a gallstone

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,879
the basic understanding is there but

76
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,200
what's behind all that like how do we

77
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,040
avoid that how do we stop

78
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,239
that what's that about well that's that

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,720
doesn't exist in science and research it

80
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,640
just doesn't may you know and and you

81
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,799
know and so we really need to cover it

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,360
and so when you know this is Advanced

83
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,760
information we're talking about here in

84
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,200
the show without a doubt this

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,799
information this is the only show where

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,159
the information here doesn't come from a

87
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,239
place an agenda driven place you know

88
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,200
like the interest groups and all the

89
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,480
strings attached to medical stuff and

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,280
medical funding and research that's been

91
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,879
all messed up and botched up and the

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,120
thumb on the scale medical lobbyists

93
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,760
that sit there and they just want

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,799
certain drugs to go through they don't

95
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,560
you know and that's all it's about both

96
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,239
you know and all these things can

97
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,000
literally be an alternative and

98
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,519
conventional medicine it really can

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,879
believe it or not internal Kickbacks

100
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,000
persuaded belief systems and private

101
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,920
panels everywhere whereare that

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,319
influence

103
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,120
decisions decisions and then of course

104
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,599
trends that start off of a lot of this

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,799
information so we have contamination

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,959
contamination in alternative medicine

107
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,239
information and of course conventional

108
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,440
medicine information it's the only show

109
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,000
that we keep all that out 100% that

110
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,400
means that we just don't go on the

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,800
internet we don't go on the internet we

112
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,600
don't need to we don't go on the

113
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,720
Internet and try to hack it all out and

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,000
S search all kinds of studies and things

115
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,919
that are all skewed and all messed up

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,520
and all agendas behind it and all kinds

117
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,720
of different panels behind it in all

118
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,280
kinds of different ways it was

119
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,880
manipulated and

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,720
contaminated we don't go by those old

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,039
laws um just the only show that comes

122
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,039
that's Pure Clean comes from a source

123
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,039
that was given to me since Age 4 and

124
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,280
have helped tens of thousands of people

125
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,560
find their way and get the information

126
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,199
they need throughout my whole lifetime

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,520
all these decades and that's where you

128
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,280
are now so that's where we are in this

129
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,199
show right here and gallbladder we're

130
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,000
going to go into this this is a good one

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,479
I really do feel this that uh we're

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,960
going to have a good

133
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,800
time we're going to have a good time I

134
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,600
remember my first experience um with a

135
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,800
gallbladder not my gallbladder but a

136
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,039
first experience with uh somebody who

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
came to me with a

138
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:28,039
gallbladder and and I remember it well

139
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,360
it was a long long time ago um I don't

140
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,639
want to date myself or anything or make

141
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,360
myself sound too old I like to think I'm

142
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,039
still

143
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,160
young but um and I remember I remember

144
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,160
when I first had my office years and

145
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,639
years and years ago and you know opened

146
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,319
it up to the public so it wasn't just

147
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,240
helping people out randomly everywhere

148
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,199
else I mean I I I helped people out all

149
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:54,160
all along the way I remember at age 134

150
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:57,360
I was a stock boy in a uh in a store in

151
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,080
a grocery store and I would help people

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,720
out all the time um I had clients that

153
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,759
developed because of that because Spirit

154
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,319
would give me information and I would

155
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,840
see what's going on with People's Health

156
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,240
right there right there in the grocery

157
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,919
store aisle right there in the grocery

158
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,639
store aisle so I I had a love for all

159
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,039
that I had a love for food and and

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,240
everything around because what Spirit

161
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,440
was teaching me constantly and and what

162
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,560
I needed to do for people and and um so

163
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,080
I liked being in that atmosphere it was

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,880
great because you know people are

165
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,800
shopping for food and and it makes them

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,880
think it makes them think and um and and

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,479
it's such so great and you give somebody

168
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,960
advice and you're like you know what you

169
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,919
need you need cucumber juice for those

170
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,960
gall

171
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,120
stones and then you know after that when

172
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,240
I finally had an office um I remember my

173
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,000
first my first case coming in with with

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,280
uh gallbladder problems and you know

175
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,240
right when the person walked through the

176
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,440
door Spirit was like gallbladder

177
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,080
gallbladder you know we got a pile of

178
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,280
sand in there we got a few stones in

179
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,240
there we got two varieties of stones in

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,919
there and there's even more varieties

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,080
than what's what's you know recorded as

182
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:17,039
far as what medical science and you know

183
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,039
research understands and so it was

184
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,800
really interesting and and and I have a

185
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,919
love for that I have a love for the

186
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,560
liver and gallbladder and everything

187
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,680
around it um so so I remember that first

188
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,080
case really clearly in the person was

189
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,039
suffering

190
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,720
suffering uh it was

191
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,560
heartbreaking and they didn't want to

192
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,520
get it taken out and since surgeries

193
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,919
have gotten better for gallbladders I

194
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,840
mean back then they weren't as

195
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,879
great and um it was more of a difficult

196
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,599
surgery it was a complicated surgery

197
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,360
back then believe it or not now you know

198
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,639
there's there's there's there's better

199
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,280
techniques there's better techniques for

200
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,440
you know snipping a gallbladder out

201
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,280
underneath the liver under there and um

202
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,280
it was a tricky place for surgeons to

203
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,199
have to go and find back in the old days

204
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,879
they had to swim around and take a

205
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,400
really good look you had needed a really

206
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:15,919
good guy or a gal with a really good eye

207
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,879
um back then and um and knew you know

208
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,919
knew that gallbladders don't sit

209
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,759
perfectly in the same place for

210
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,000
everybody and that's something I want to

211
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,560
talk about too is that um gallbladders

212
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,319
just aren't in the same spot for every

213
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,959
single person how's that possible I

214
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,599
thought we were all created equal in

215
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:41,479
some way or identical in some way with

216
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:44,159
our bodies right no no no no no no um

217
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,320
the strangest things with our body one

218
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,680
is with gallbladders they're not always

219
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,519
in the same spot well you know you might

220
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,640
be thinking well where are they how

221
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
where could a gallbladder be besides

222
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,000
tucked underneath the liver under there

223
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,800
under the right side up there you know

224
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,200
where where would it be well an inch

225
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,360
over how about that how about an inch

226
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,760
over which makes a huge difference when

227
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,560
you're when you're a

228
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:14,000
surgeon an inch over um how about like

229
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,600
cocked up a wrong way not or or a

230
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,279
different way how about that how about

231
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,240
that how about a gallbladder that's not

232
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,200
just sitting the way it's supposed to be

233
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,399
but since childhood since meaning since

234
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,880
birth and everything it it it took a

235
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,920
different position how how about that

236
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,640
how about a gallbladder that's a

237
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,399
different shape entirely different shape

238
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,519
it's not that that little pear shape

239
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:43,519
that little pocket but it's it's got an

240
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,480
apple shape how about those apples right

241
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,800
so it's sitting differently not every

242
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,279
gallbladder looks the same not every

243
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,279
gallbladder looks the same I talked to a

244
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:56,360
surgeon actually uh pretty recently and

245
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,000
and and I was I was telling the surgeon

246
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,560
about that kind of very thing and he

247
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,279
says it's amazing that you even know

248
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,320
that he said and I know and the surgeon

249
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,600
you know he a friend of mine and he goes

250
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,760
and he goes and I know you know all

251
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,640
these things because that's what you

252
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,000
done that's what you do we you know we

253
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,320
know that but it's still it's still

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,160
mindblowing that you know this that's

255
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,399
what the surgeon said to me so my friend

256
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,880
said to me it's still mind-blowing that

257
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,360
you know this he knows why I know this

258
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,560
because of spirit but it's still it was

259
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,600
weird it was weird to him to hear

260
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,600
it because because all not all

261
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,240
gallbladders look the same if you cut

262
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,079
enough of them out if you've cut enough

263
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,800
of those babies

264
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,040
out over the years you you'll know

265
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,040
between women's gallbladders men men's

266
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:47,200
gallbladders the whole bit you would

267
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,399
know and um you know it it just it takes

268
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,079
experience and being that I've never

269
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,320
snipped out a gallbladder before ever

270
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,040
he's just like it's just I don't just

271
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,560
don't I I I know you hear Spirit but I

272
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,320
still don't get it how you know these

273
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,639
little nuances how you know these little

274
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,959
things and um and because of that though

275
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,000
the different shapes and sizes and

276
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,200
everything it shows that we're all

277
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,600
unique in all different ways without a

278
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,079
doubt but back in the old days back in

279
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,279
the older days finding that finding that

280
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,399
little gallbladder in there you know

281
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:25,440
wasn't always so easy took some time

282
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:29,040
took a little searching took a little

283
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,839
TLC and but now now I mean surgeons are

284
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,360
you know we found different ways of of

285
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,279
of using you know different technology

286
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,079
for for getting in there and we got

287
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,120
better scanning machines and so forth

288
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,920
and all that and you know and thank God

289
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,600
thank God that's right I mean I stand

290
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,560
behind science and research I stand

291
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,680
behind medical advancement 100% I'm

292
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,480
always peed off about about chronic

293
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,200
illness the area there I think that was

294
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,560
just just totally just you know I just

295
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,880
think we've all been left left out to

296
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,880
dry on that and I can't help it you know

297
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,040
medical denial with chronic illness is

298
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,000
unbelievable and I can't help it I can't

299
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,160
help it I just you know I'm still yeah

300
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,720
yeah I'm still burnt up about that after

301
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,839
all these years I've seen too many

302
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,279
people suffer no answers for people and

303
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,560
the answers they do get now is is

304
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,600
becoming

305
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,920
ridiculous and look I'm not against the

306
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,320
whole lime disease thing but I'm going

307
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,199
to tell you right now um everybody's

308
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,800
going to be diagnosed with Lyme disease

309
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:34,240
everybody in chronic illness everybody

310
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,519
everybody because the system is messed

311
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,279
up terribly terribly anybody with

312
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,519
anything lupus diagnosis those are going

313
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,320
to be a thing of the past it's all going

314
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,480
to be pushed off the lime everything's

315
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,920

to be pushed off the lime anything is

317
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,160
going to be pushed off the

318
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,360
lime and that's that's by Design that's

319
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,920
by Design By the way that's by Design if

320
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,880
that's getting anybody upset right now

321
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,600
because limes tends to tends to you know

322
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,600
the whole lime thing tends to get people

323
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
just red up and they get angry and

324
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
pissed off and just read my chapter in

325
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,800
book one whatever you do and read it

326
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,360
with an open mind don't read it with

327
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,199
anger in your heart read it with an open

328
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,680
mind it's

329
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,959
important um so yeah yeah in and but

330
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,040
with the gallbladder thing you know it's

331
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,519
it's great we have great people you they

332
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,880
can help somebody with a gallbladder

333
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:31,519
problem we have great great

334
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,120
surgeons but it's as far as information

335
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,839
about how to prevent the gallbladder

336
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,639
problem as far as

337
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,120
information to uh dissolve

338
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,480
Stones you know the one thing I don't

339
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:50,880
like is gallbladder

340
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:54,720
flushes y I don't like them no no

341
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,279
no I don't like them at all doing this a

342
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,360
long time and Spirits always said you

343
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,320
know no gallbladder flesh is why I've

344
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,360
seen people pop a good Stone in that

345
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,079
duct get it

346
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,600
stuck when we didn't need to do a

347
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,040
gallbladder flush we didn't need to try

348
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
to do gallbladder flush we could have

349
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,000
just dissolved the stone what was in the

350
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,079
gallbladder while it was sitting in

351
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
there all nice and pretty in a good spot

352
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,959
and we could have slowly dissolved it we

353
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,720
could have gotten a liver in a better

354
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,839
condition so it wouldn't keep on

355
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,600
producing a gall stone or growing it we

356
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,440
could do a lot of things we don't have

357
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,480
to try to do this flush and accidentally

358
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,839
pop a giant Stone up into the duct and

359
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,160
get it stuck and then it's emergency Sur

360
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,880
emergency surgery time or get it in get

361
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,959
it popped in there and get it stuck and

362
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,040
get it

363
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,800
infected over time little strep a cacus

364
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,399
that's already in your digestive tra and

365
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,000
in your in your your IND wadum and

366
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,320
everything else that backtracks and

367
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,279
finds its way up there a little bit of

368
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,079
strip caucus that you know it's always

369
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,079
sitting in people's livers that just you

370
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,480
know jumps up

371
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,800
into jumps up to the gallbladder it's

372
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,160
waiting for something stupid to happen

373
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,600
that's what it's doing it's waiting for

374
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,560
something stupid to happen like a stone

375
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,480
getting jammed because of a flush and

376
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,600
then getting a little bit swollen in

377
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,160
there because the tissue starts to get

378
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,480
irritable and then boom the strep jumps

379
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,800
in there and Dives right in and then

380
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,240
infects the heck out of it and then now

381
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,040
you're rushing to the hospital and it's

382
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,199
partly turning green I I can't tell you

383
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,639
how many times I've seen that happen

384
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,360
from gallbladder fleshes till this day I

385
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,240

fact that you're healing people I like

399
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,360
the fact that you're working on healing

400
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,240
people in different ways you probably

401
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,720
know all kinds of incredible

402
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,880
information and and and everything else

telling people to constantly do a

405
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,839

some original Source somewhere that just

410
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,920
was wrong to begin

everybody's backs you know I've seen a

441
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,360
lot of surgeries that were unnecessary

442
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,080
over the years I've been doing this for

443
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,679
a long long time and it's funny someone

444
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,360

445
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:47,039

back you know vouching for me with

450
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,760
stories all the way since Charlie you

451
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,240
you talked to them You' tell you you ask

452
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,840
them when I started being a medium you

453
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,640
know and it's not just that I mean I've

454
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,120
been I've been working on people forever

455
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,039
working with people forever and going

456
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,400
all the way back and it hasn't been just

457
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,720
5 years hasn't been just 7 years hasn't

458
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,919
been 9 years hasn't been 12 years hasn't

459
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,919
been 15 years been a lot longer and so

460
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,360
I've been able to witness a lot just

461
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,240
like a good surgeon Witnesses so much

462
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,120
just like a good surgeon you know I mean

463
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,320
who's got a track record

464
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,240
a long-term track

465
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,679
record and you know and and basically

466
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,159
the bottom line is I'm not trying to

467
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,360
hurt anybody's feelings I'm just saying

468
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,840
hey look instead of doing the flushes

469
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,640
anymore let's redesign it let's change

470
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,120
it up let's let's figure out something

471
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,400
different let's figure out another way

472
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,480
which spirit and I already

473
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,520
know but let's figure out another way to

474
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,159
dissolve Stones wouldn't that be nice

475
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,120
would wouldn't that be great we can

476
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,799
dissolve them how about that or stop

477
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,919
producing them how about that or both

478
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,760
wouldn't that be nice absolutely

479
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,400
absolutely without a

480
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,480
doubt so Stones what's the deal with

481
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,080
those or what are they made out of right

482
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,240
well made out of

483
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,280
cholesterol okay made out of you know

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,600
kind of like your oil filter in a way so

548
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,080
getting really gunky in there really

549
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,559
clogged and gunky in there if you don't

550
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,200
change your oil if you don't change your

551
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,960
oil in your

552
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,860
liver if you don't change the oil in

553
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,440
your engine in the

554
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,720
[Laughter]

555
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,559
car right I mean it just gets gunier and

556
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,039
dark it turns jet black and it just it's

557
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,240
it's got all kinds of metal fragments in

558
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,640
there because the engine doesn't have

559
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,039
viscosity anymore so the you know the

560
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,760
crankshaft is just spinning in the

561
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:27,520
valves and everything else is just it's

562
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,880
just um it's just everything's getting

563
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,440
Mucky

564
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,960
everything's getting

565
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,679
Mucky and then the oil's getting dirtier

566
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,760
and dirtier and the the air filter is

567
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,080
not being changed and all this garbage

568
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,760
is going

569
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,039
in right I mean some of you probably

570
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,039
know that some of you probably don't

571
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,600
some of you are probably like I don't

572
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,320
know I just turned the key on the car

573
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:55,679
and that's

574
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:59,480
it and that oil turns into a sludge a

575
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:02,320
sludge turns into a sludge

576
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,440
like scrape off the bottom of the oil

577
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,919
pan a

578
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,440
sludge that's how it

579
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:12,320
works so they don't change your oil it

580
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,919
gets dirty and Mucky and ugly it turns

581
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,520
into a sludge a

582
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,840
pudding thick black pudding the bottom

583
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,840
of your

584
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:26,559
pan and it's set it's settlement

585
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:30,080
sediment right sediment is that what it

586
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,279
is and um the oil filter gets clogged

587
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,760
and everything

588
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,640
else or maybe it's just sediment at the

589
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,080
bottom of the pan maybe that's what that

590
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,279
gallbladder is it's like the bottom of

591
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,279
the

592
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,960
pan and all that Gunk and settlement is

593
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,760
in there and that's

594
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,400
different believe it or not that's the

595
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,360
third thing science research isn't

596
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
really identifying they talk about that

597
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,240
they talk about lots of different Stones

598
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,480
you get an ultrasound you get a CAT scan

599
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,640
an ultrasound an MRI and the nurse

600
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,360
practitioner the nurse comes in or the

601
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,279
doctor comes in and says oh my God

602
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,559
you're your your gallbladder is hundreds

603
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:07,559
and hundreds of stones it's filled with

604
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,159
sand

605
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,960
and that

606
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:18,440
sand isn't

607
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,919
always gall stones meaning it meaning it

608
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,320
isn't always cholesterol Stones is

609
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,320
information that's not known out

610
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,640
there news flash that saying and isn't

611
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,559
always Billy Ruben those red blood

612
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,720
cells it's a third

613
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:41,120
component that's science of research

614
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:44,679
hasn't tapped into that gunk in that

615
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:48,240
gallbladder is all kinds of stuff it's

616
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:52,640
dead viral carcasses dead viral

617
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:56,760
byproduct dead pathogen byproduct dead

618
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,600
um uh bacterial byproduct

619
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:04,360
Plastics spit up from the liver from

620
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:07,279
antibiotics petrol oil petrol

621
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,039
oil and I'm not doing the analogy the

622
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,480
metaphor I'm not doing that part I'm not

623
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:13,279
just talking about the oil on the bottom

624
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,880
of a pan is real engine oil in the

625
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:22,760
bottom of a pan of a car you

626
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,000
guys I I'm talking about real petrol oil

627
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,919
put in

628
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,440
antibiotics they don't need to put that

629
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,799
in there by the way I mean I scratched

630
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,720
my head I'm scratching my head right

631
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,360
now they don't need to put that in there

632
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,000
just one of those additives that don't

633
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,200
have to be in

634
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,399
antibiotics they just don't have to be

635
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,440
there isn't that funny isn't that funny

636
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,360
I mean you know we talk about foods and

637
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,480
everything preservatives and foods and

638
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,720
you know you want your chicken

639
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,159
antibiotic free right you want all that

640
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,360
you want your chicken be free range you

641
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,120
you know you don't want preservatives

642
00:25:52,360 --> 00:26:00,320
you don't want aluminum nitrate you

643
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:03,360
don't want aluminum pumped into to your

644
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,120
chickens you know they they you know

645
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,559
inject aluminum and turkeys and chickens

646
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,120
plump them up I mean you don't want that

647
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,760
in there right you don't want all this

648
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,080
whatever in there but when we take an

649
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,279
antibiotic they put all the stuff in

650
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,960
there I mean they don't have to that's

651
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:22,399
the sad part they don't have they don't

652
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,360
have to have petrol oil in there but

653
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:27,279
where does that petrol oil go it's small

654
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,760
amounts real small amounts doesn't

655
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,799
matter liver the liver you know the

656
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,039
liver gets pissed off

657
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,000
anyway and it storage it stores these

658
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,840
these

659
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,080
petrochemicals and you can get other

660
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,200
exposure to petrochemicals

661
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,000
too and from other drugs and other

662
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,480
sources other avenues and liver you know

663
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,960
eventually just if the liver is not

664
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,000
getting cleaned up if we're not eating

665
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,399
right if we're not taking care of the

666
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,559
liver if we're not doing what we need to

667
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:55,039
do for the

668
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,080
liver if our diet's not good if we're

669
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,600
pounding in tons of protein and fat in

670
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,600
our diet

671
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,279
thinking that's the way even if we're no

672
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,440
carb and we're exercising and we're

673
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,200
starting to look better and we're

674
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,159
starting to get a little bit more fit

675
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,200
our liver is still taking a hit like oh

676
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:13,000
my God nobody knows that by the

677
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,080
way and so what does the liver do it

678
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,480
pushes pushes that stuff right up into

679
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,080
the gallbladder and it's not Billy Rubin

680
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,080
it's not our friend Billy

681
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,559
Ruben it's you know it's not our friend

682
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:32,799
CEST

683
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:35,679
raw making names out of these two things

684
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,200
all right I'm being silly today there's

685
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,240
nothing to be silly about with gall

686
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,399
stones and

687
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,960
gallbladders see a lot of people go

688
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,240
through a lot of trouble I think I'm

689
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,120
just giggly

690
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,279
today it's

691
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,519
unbelievable um yeah you got to keep a

692
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:54,000
light heart we got to keep a light heart

693
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:57,240
okay so there's something else that gets

694
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,360
going there's something else going on in

695
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,039
that sludge it's a whole bunch of waste

696
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,320
that's not analyzed by research and

697
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,320
science they don't analyze that you know

698
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:10,080
why it's got a guilty Trail in it it's

699
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,519
got a guilty

700
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,919
Trail it's

701
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:19,240
got a trail it's got It's

702
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,519
evidence it's evidence of all kinds of

703
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,799
crap I mean everything there's heavy

704
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,279
metals in there literally and you know

705
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:29,000
what's so bizarre what's so bizarre is

706
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,480
that that's what's in engine oil that's

707
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,039
that's that when engine oil is not

708
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,000
replaced and it and it sits at the

709
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,480
bottom of the pan you guys it gets

710
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,440
filled with these little micro micr

711
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,640
chips of metal that are coming out of

712
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,640
the engine because there's no

713
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,279
viscosity well there's heavy metals

714
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,240
saturating the liver from all kinds of

715
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:52,279
reasons all kinds of reasons medical

716
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,240
reasons you know medical

717
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:56,960
stuff uh Medical Products uh all kinds

718
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,480
of different things just you know stuff

719
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,039
falling out of the sky uh food pots and

720
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,480
pans people scraping pots and pans

721
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:07,279
restaurants restaurants are the worst

722
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,720
the worst unless it's a good one unless

723
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,440
it's a good one that's really taking

724
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,840
care of everybody in the food properly

725
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,720
so if you're a restaurant owner I'm sure

726
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,159
that's what you're doing if you're

727
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,760
listening to this show then that's

728
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,159
definitely what you're do you're doing

729
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:24,000
without a doubt but the bottom line is

730
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,480
that metal heavy metals toxic heavy

731
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,840
metals sit in that sludge but that

732
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,760
sludge never gets

733
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:35,399
analyzed never gets analyzed they never

734
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:38,159
do and and and and if and if they have

735
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:41,760
which they probably

736
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,760
have um I'm sure they kept out the bad

737
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,600
stuff bad stuff in any study because

738
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,600
like I said at the beginning of the

739
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,360
show blah blah blah this information

740
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,360
doesn't come from this this this this

741
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,960
this this contaminated this this sources

742
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,840
this this this this trendy traps the

743
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,279
payoffs all that crap it's like I said

744
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,200
at the beginning

745
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,760
because what's in that sludge is a whole

746
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,720
bunch of

747
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,679
evidence all kinds of metals Plastics

748
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,640
petroleum oils can you believe it yeah

749
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:14,000
yeah yeah yeah and nobody knows it and

750
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,000
that's the third aspect of what's inside

751
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,519
a gallbladder mind blown mine is Spirit

752
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,240
blows my mind all the time mind blown

753
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,080
seriously if yours isn't then I

754
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:30,360
understand but mine is

755
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:32,559
boom I mean and that's the third part so

756
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,200
let's go through them a little bit all

757
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,279
right the cholesterol Stone why is

758
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,600
cholesterol like amping up and becoming

759
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:44,399
a rolling stone in there what the

760
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,840
heck what is going

761
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,720
on that's because a liver is becoming

762
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,799
dysfunctional a liver is becoming

763
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,159
dysfunctional because big part of its

764
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,440
diet and other part of it the liver is

765
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,799
getting sluggish and dysfunctional

766
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,240
stagnant even fatty even if it's pre-

767
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,240
fatty liver and not diagnosed

768
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:06,080
what about old Billy Billy

769
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,799
Ruben right why is that happening

770
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,000
because red blood cells mean a liver is

771
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:12,039
under stress and it's contaminated with

772
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,840
a lot of toxins and pathogens and stuff

773
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,360
like that so it's it's dealing with he

774
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,039
hemoglobin a lot differently and red

775
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,080
blood cells start to they start to do

776
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:22,240
something they start to glue each other

777
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,519
together the pigment starts to glue

778
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,159
itself together and creating a stone

779
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,519
when the liver is too

780
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,200
overburdened

781
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:33,639
and then you know like Grandma's apple

782
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,600
pie you just need the right recipe you

783
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:37,279
just need the right recipe I said that

784
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,240
probably one of the earliest shows ever

785
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,000
that we did one of the early

786
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,600
shows and I've also said it many many

787
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,159
years ago grandma's Apple Pie tastes

788
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,440
just the way it does because it's just

789
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,799
right because she puts just a little bit

790
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,159
of nutmeg in but not too much and not

791
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,760
too too little little bit of salt not a

792
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,679
lot of salt balancing it with the

793
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,919
sweet I'm being silly today I know sorry

794
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,840
you guys seriously seriously let's take

795
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,960
this as serious as

796
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,880
possible but seriously though with

797
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,399
Grandma's apple pie it's just right for

798
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,000
a reason it made a recipe for a reason

799
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:21,320
with Billy ruin and and and in

800
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,360
cholesterol stones to do what they're

801
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,240
doing it takes also a recipe of what's

802
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,159
in that other sludge P pile what's in

803
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,679
the other sludge pile the sludge pile is

804
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:30,639
the evidence of what's going on inside

805
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:33,240
the liver which creates the recipe of

806
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:38,200
creating the stones for God's

807
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,039
sake yeah mind blown information

808
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,600
overload because it's never been

809
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:45,679
released anywhere that information of

810
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,960
course just like 85 90% of everything

811
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,279
else on the shows I

812
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,559
do I'm saying that in case you know if

813
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,000
you're on the internet a lot of people

814
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,240
they're like okay okay what do to see

815
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,120
okay let's get on the internet okay

816
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,760
let's let's look into this and now

817
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,360
they're like going you they're going

818
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,360
crazy they're looking they're

819
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,559
looking so it's really about the liver

820
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,279
in this situation it's about the liver

821
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:13,360
producing an amount of of toxic waste

822
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,799
from not being cared for but it's the

823
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,039
right kind of toxic waste that can glue

824
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,159
red blood cells together creating that

825
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,760
pigment stone that Billy Ruben stone

826
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:27,200
that stone I hate that

827
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:31,799
stone I hate that stone cuz that one's a

828
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:34,080
weird one Billy Ruben that stone I I

829
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:35,919
don't like that stone a little harder to

830
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,760
dissolve I've had to get a lot of people

831
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
to dissolve

832
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,679
them absolutely I had to change your

833
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,720
diet around the right way to get them to

834
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,159
dissolve I had to do different things

835
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,159
but I I I hate that

836
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:55,559
stone cholesterol Stones eh I don't hate

837
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,159
we can break those down no

838
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:59,960
problem we can we can we can break them

839
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,880
down easier faster we can break down the

840
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,240
Billy Rubin too I mean that's okay too

841
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,120
we can do that stone too and we can get

842
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,440
rid of some of the sludge but we don't

843
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,440
want to do it with a gallbladder

844
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,679
flush a silly gallbladder

845
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,000
flush I'll tell you right now you don't

846
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,119
want that cholesterol Stone to pop up

847
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,760
into that duct and lock itself in and

848
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,200
maybe you're lucky maybe you're lucky

849
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,839
and it won't as a lot of people do they

850
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,679
get by they get lucky on that it's a

851
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,240
good it's but I don't like r roulette do

852
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,879
you I don't like it I don't like taking

853
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,520
a gun with one bullet spinning the

854
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,399
chamber putting up to my head for fun I

855
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,240
just don't like that I'm not a Russian

856
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,200
Roulette kind of guy maybe when I was a

857
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,919
kid maybe when I was a kid I'd be like

858
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,839
all right I I'll take the chance you I

859
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:48,839
was you know maybe when I was 10 11 12

860
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,200
years

861
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:54,679
old I would you know take

862
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,119
chances not like anything stupid like

863
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,240
that but I would be like all right all

864
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,720
right I I I bet we can do this I bet we

865
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,240
can take this bicycle and we can jump it

866
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,680
over this Ravine with this little wooden

867
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,079
ramp I got Spirit watching my back

868
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,160
Spirit won't let me get hurt I'll F I'll

869
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,760
Fly Like a Bird on this

870
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,440
bicycle I'll jump this River with this

871
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,560
bicycle I'll take a chance there's

872
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,160
chances are what's my odd Spirit 90%

873
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,240
chance you're not going to make it 10%

874
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,599
chance that you're going to make it and

875
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,839
when you do make it to the other side

876
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,240
you're probably going to have broken

877
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:33,079
bones all right I'll take my chance well

878
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,359
what's the guarantee about that 10% with

879
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:37,200
broken bones well 1% you won't have any

880
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,359
broken bones just really bad bruises and

881
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,359
injury okay I'll take the chance

882
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,079
1% and you know so yeah but but I don't

883
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,920
like doing that I don't like doing any

884
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,319
of that now that was when I was young

885
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,440
but the point

886
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:55,880
is the point is is that we don't want to

887
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,359
do that you don't want to do the flushes

888
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,520
you don't want to pop a stone stone in

889
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:03,200
there in the

890
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,040
duck and in the

891
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,839
duct okay so let's move on let's move on

892
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,720
we're trying to cut through this um

893
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,839
telling you guys too many stories spasms

894
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,160
and infections gallbladder infections I

895
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,319
hate gallbladder

896
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,079
infections you can get food poisoning in

897
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:19,920
a restaurant and it can take out your

898
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,560
gallbladder

899
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,480
boy man that food born toxin that food

900
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,960
born bacteria that salmonella anything

901
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,359
like that can Rush up to that

902
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,280
gallbladder I mean if yeah if you're

903
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,400
lucky and you're just vomiting for a day

you're burping and burping and burping

907
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,319
because of a food born toxin in a

908
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,319
restaurant and I you guys should listen

909
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:44,720
to my to my uh I think the show's called

clients uh I've had you know doctors

921
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,200
friends getting the worst food poisoning

922
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,839
ever in their

923
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,440
life um you know but you name it and and

924
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:20,000
what happens is with food poisoning is

925
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,200
is sometimes it can get us really good

926
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,640
and it could and that bacteria could

927
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,920
Rush right up to the gallbladder and

928
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,520
infect it get it to spasm like hell for

929
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,160
a long time until the body can

930
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,880
overcompensate and clean it up and

931
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,319
sometimes it can't and then surgeons

932
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,319
have to remove the gallbladder if food

933
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,800
poisoning I'm drinking cucumber juice

934
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,760
right

935
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,240
now by the way just kind of sipping it

936
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,680
in between a little

937
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,920
bit cucumber juice why would I be

938
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,119
drinking cucumber juice on a day we're

939
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,160
doing gallbladder because cucumber juice

940
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,640
helps to

941
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,720
dissolve gallbladder stones but it does

942
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,400
more than that it helps to alleviate

943
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,839
sludge out of the liver in a different

944
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,520
way that it doesn't have to back up

945
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:03,200
Purge back up into the gallbladder sit

946
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,839
there and settle into a pile of Gunk

947
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,480
pile of engine oil in that

948
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,359
gallbladder that's almost like the

949
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,400
gallbladder is the bottom of the pan of

950
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,400
an a car oil

951
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:22,079
pan and um you know what happens what

952
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:24,160
happens here what happens here is that

953
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,599
food poisoning is one thing that's one

954
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,240
thing but also eoli that sits inside our

955
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,119
intestinal tract long term or strep or

956
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,720
ecoli especially ecoli too you know they

957
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,560
sit in our intestinal tract for long

958
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,680
term and if they break out and you get

959
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,359
gastritis and they kind of bubbles up

960
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,319
and breaks out in your intestinal tract

961
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,839
and you got a bout of gastritis you

962
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:43,040
could always get in trouble with your

963
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:45,520
gallbladder and appendix

964
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,480
too so we want to just take care of

965
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,079
things the liver tries to trap as much

966
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,720
bacteria and pathogens as it can

967
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,200
possibly

968
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:58,079
trap the liver's immune system tries to

969
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:01,319
destroy as much bacteria as possible

970
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,160
you know I'm not a what is it uh

971
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:06,920
confrontational kind of guy at all you

972
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:11,040
know I'm not one of those guys um you

973
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:13,000
know with going going uh going all these

974
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,839
years with hearing spirit's

975
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,440
voice and helping people you know I mean

976
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,720
there's been times over the years where

977
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,400
people are just in

978
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,200
disbelief that they're even healing from

979
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,400
the information you know I remember when

980
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,680
I was younger years and years ago

981
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,160
getting people that were healing and

982
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,079
still they can't believe I'm hearing the

983
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,680
voice and giving them the advice that's

984
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:32,800
actually getting them better they just

985
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,760
think it's some kind of fluke I've

986
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,040
remembered cases like that once in a

987
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,760
while every now and

988
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,880
then and I even remember confrontation

989
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,640
when I was younger too every now and

990
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,280
then I remember this one one case going

991
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,119
all the way back I think I was 18 years

992
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,359
old and um this woman came to me no

993
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,079
doctor would listen she was so fatigued

994
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,520
she couldn't just get out of bed it took

995
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,119
everything everything she had to get to

996
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,119
the office everything she had to get to

997
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,040
the

998
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,240
office and

999
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,200
um and she she had New Hope Spirit found

1000
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,800
a virus that she was suffering with she

1001
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,280
had severe chronic fatigue from a

1002
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,119
neurological

1003
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,760
virus and it was inflaming everything in

1004
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,079
her body she was she was literally at 40

1005
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,760
or 50 doctors best clinics across the

1006
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,359
country this is a you know long time ago

1007
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,119
before the world has changed and before

1008
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,240
the internet uh turned into the internet

1009
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,319
and everything else before there was an

1010
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:34,599
internet I'm sorry before before there

1011
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:37,079
was an internet when I remember she was

1012
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,720
recovering first time first time in

1013
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,839
years recovering she can get out of bed

1014
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,240
and start recovering and her husband was

1015
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:48,240
mad angry because I wasn't a medical

1016
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,520
doctor cuz I was a medical medium the

1017
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,520
medical medium so I remember he came to

1018
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,319
the office by

1019
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,839
himself and and she was recovering and

1020
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,000
he came to the office all disgruntled

1021
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,720
all

1022
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,960
angry and he said that uh he didn't he

1023
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,800
didn't want her coming anymore to uh for

1024
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,000
appointments even though she was getting

1025
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,640
better and he admitted she's getting

1026
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,920
better but but there was something

1027
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,359
inside of him that just couldn't stand

1028
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,680
the fact that it was it was the medium

1029
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:20,440
thing couldn't stand it so he hindered

1030
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,760
her healing hindered her healing I

1031
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,880
didn't know she overcame it and took the

1032
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:29,480
advice and

1033
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:32,640
recovered and um but she had such more

1034
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:36,160
more more more you know struggles

1035
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,520
because of the delay of the

1036
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,160
hindrance and so confrontation is

1037
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,040
something I don't like and what happens

1038
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,920
is that when the liver is under

1039
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,560
confrontation cuz that's what happening

1040
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,680
all the time the liver it's under

1041
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,280
confrontation non-stop it's under

1042
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,480
confrontation with with a diet that

1043
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,760
we're under it's under stress it's under

1044
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,720
it's constantly being attacked it's

1045
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,440
constantly being braided it's constantly

1046
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,839
being antagon you know antagonized it's

1047
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,640
constantly being irritated you know

1048
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:10,000
livers up against a tremendous amount of

1049
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,680
that all the time so it it it it breaks

1050
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,520
its ability down to do what it's got to

1051
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,440
do it's got an immune system that wants

1052
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,520
to seek and

1053
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,319
destroy the liver has its own immune

1054
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,400
system that wants to Seek and

1055
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:26,359
Destroy pathogens but when constantly

1056
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,680
you know the confrontation involved it

1057
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:31,440
it could Sidetrack it confrontation

1058
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,119
meaning eating the wrong Foods

1059
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,559
tremendous amount of adrenaline in your

1060
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,880
life tons of

1061
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,440
stress and then it it it can't send the

1062
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,880
soldiers out the liver takes has no

1063
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,920
mercy it takes no mercy it is an immune

1064
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,599
system designed to

1065
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:52,480
destroy

1066
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:54,400
kill yeah yeah that's right that's right

1067
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,400
it's not weak in that

1068
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,520
nature you know it doesn't like

1069
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,559
conversation on any L level it doesn't

1070
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:04,680
like problems but it's not it won't back

1071
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,400
down it won't back down unless it's

1072
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,440
forced to and it's getting sidetracked

1073
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,200
to that

1074
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,680
degree and um so I always think about

1075
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,480
that you know I I I I just want

1076
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,480

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,359
everybody happy I want everybody healing

1078
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,839
and I want everybody happy uh and even

1079
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,400
even as a kid I used to say the spirit

1080
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:24,559
why is this person disgruntled when

1081
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,640
their most beloved person in their

1082
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:30,599
family is so it's getting so much better

1083
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,160
he's been so sick and spirit would say

1084
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,359
well you know it's it's like ego stuff

1085
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,079
and it's it's jealousy stuff it's just

1086
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,240
weird stuff it's a whole pile of just

1087
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,280
emotional

1088
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,559
damage emotional damage and I said well

1089
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,400
you know it's amazing because you know

1090
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,319
and that reminded me of people's

1091
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,319
livers people's

1092
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:50,800
livers you know what's getting in the

1093
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:53,599
way of people doing the right thing for

1094
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,800
their liver a lot of bad information and

1095
00:43:53,599 --> 00:44:00,640
misinformation out there that has those

1096
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,200
things attached to it like ego and and

1097
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,559
all kinds of different things and

1098
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,800
agendas and everything else that are

1099
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,000
going on and it gets in the way of

1100
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,319
people healing gets in the PE it gets in

1101
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,920
the way of people ever protecting their

1102
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,680
liver protecting their liver healing the

1103
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,119
liver looking after their liver and a

1104
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,640
liver needs help and it needs that

1105
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,280
attention it needs that attention and

1106
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,559
this this woman

1107
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,480
actually I mean this was this was

1108
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,319
horrific what she was going through

1109
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,599
horrific and healing for the first time

1110
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:29,200
she just needed she just need needed

1111
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,640
some of that information the liver just

1112
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,920
needs some

1113
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,800
attention needs some attention so it

1114
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,720
could do what you you need to do her

1115
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,599
immune system needed a little bit of

1116
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,119
caring a little bit of compassion a

1117
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:44,960
little bit of the right information for

1118
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,640
the first time in her her life so that

1119
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,000
her immune system could go and seek out

1120
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,839
and Destroy and do what it needs to do

1121
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,240
and not get sidetracked the liver needs

1122
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,599
a same thing it's got an immune system

1123
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,680
that wants to Seek and Destroy and kill

1124
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,520
things but it gets sidetracked so

1125
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,000
confrontation is not good no matter what

1126
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,920
in in you know when it comes down to

1127
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,960
healing and so many people have to deal

1128
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,520
with

1129
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,079
it so what do we do we want to dissolve

1130
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,839
Stones we want to clean up the liver we

1131
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,680
want to do the right things low protein

1132
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,920
diet low protein diet you think you got

1133
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,680
a liver thing developing low protein

1134
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,440
diet why cuz it's lowfat lowfat diet

1135
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,800
lowfat if you're a vegan cut back on the

1136
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,720
nuts cut back on the nuts and seeds too

1137
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,160
many nuts too many seeds nut pies

1138
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,800
nutcakes whatever I even if you're all

1139
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,800
whatever and I respect that I love it I

1140
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,280
love raw vegan stuff I love raw

1141
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,520
plant-based I'm totally behind that 100%

1142
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,240
oh my God I've seen people I've seen

1143
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,760
people get rid of the worst diseases

1144
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:43,920
ever in history with those the 28-day

1145
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:48,520
cleanse the 28 day cleanse in my book

1146
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:52,240
one is literally 28 days of low to no

1147
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:56,400
fat plant-based mostly

1148
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:59,160
raw why to to get the liver

1149
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,559
to where it needs to be to get the liver

1150
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,599
to do more than to dissolve stones to

1151
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,640
dissolve stones for God's sake to get

1152
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,520
the liver in a better place doesn't mean

1153
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,240
I'm anti-animal protein or anything if

1154
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,880
somebody wants to eat animal

1155
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,240
protein but when somebody's doing these

1156
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,640
gallbladder flushes and then going after

1157
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,640
the gallbladder flesh they're eating all

1158
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,440
this animal protein a week later and

1159
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,040
they're pounding that liver down that

1160
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,240
liver the amount of bile it has to

1161
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,680
produce is unbelievable to break down

1162
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,760
fat and animal fat and animal protein

1163
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,319
and and forget the animal stuff that

1164
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:37,400
liver has to do so much to break down

1165
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:40,520
plant fat like nuts tons and tons of

1166
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,119
nuts and oils so if a vegan also a

1167
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,800
plant-based person is eating of

1168
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:47,319
vegetarians eating still all this fat

1169
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,319
constantly eating tons of it the liver

1170
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:52,000
still has to produce tremendous amounts

1171
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:53,000
of bile salt the pressure and the stress

1172
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,599
it goes

1173
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,119
under is ridiculous he can't dissolve

1174
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,760
stuff Stones Under that you can't clean

1175
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,200
up the sludge at the bottom of the

1176
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,400
gallbladder the bottom of the oil pan

1177
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,880
you can't you can't do

1178
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,559
that and if you're eating animal protein

1179
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,880
and you dropped your carbs fine okay you

1180
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:11,319
dropped chocolate cake that's the best

1181
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,960
thing you can do that's great but yet

1182
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:14,760
you're just doing vegetables and lots of

1183
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,440
animal fat without realizing it is your

1184
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,359
calorie to survive because of some

1185
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,440
trendy diet out there from somebody that

1186
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,680
knows absolutely nothing about the liver

1187
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,559
because that's what I've seen that's

1188
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,280

the greatest preventative ever for

1228
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:03,160
keeping gallstones from producing and

1229
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,559

the morning that you do your green juice

1287
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,920
you can do lots of fruit you don't have

1288
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,200
to starve you don't have to starve maybe

1289
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,440
mid morning you can bring a little fat

1290
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,760
in but just hold it back from morning

1291
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,040
morning don't even have milk which is

1292
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,640
fat in your coffee in the morning

1293
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,680
because you just put fat in there which

1294
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,559
what it does it puts stress on the liver

1295
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,160
the liver can't do what it needs to do

1296
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,240
it just had a night from hell every

1297
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,520
single night the liver has a night from

1298
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,760
hell trying to process and and take care

1299
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,760
of the the the the the garbage that's in

1300
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,839
your diet in your life the poisons that

1301
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,040
are inside the liver that inherited from

1302
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,680
your parents all the way down and that

1303
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,599
liver is so filled up with poisons it's

1304
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,880
unbelievable and it strains all night

1305
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,200
and it has to work all night while

1306
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,079
you're sleeping and in the morning what

1307
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,119
do we do we put something in there like

1308
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,280
an

1309
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,079
egg and we're going to end up with a

1310
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,119
cholesterol Stone I'm sorry maybe not

1311
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,680

1312
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:23,559
losing weight and you're on this new

1313
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,480
diet fancy diet and you think eggs are

1314
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,799
great and you're not going to get a

1315
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,920
cholesterol Stone that's not how it

1316
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:29,280
works you'll get that cholesterol Stone

1317
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,799
down the

1318
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,319
road that's

1319
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:36,480

longer they've dissolved their

1325
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,559
Stones you could but but the lemon water

1326
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:51,599
is critical for dissolving Stones

1327
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:54,160
cranberries dissolve Stones cranberry

1328
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,200

cranberry water

1331
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,680
actually actually

1332
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,079

and they clean up the liver they clean

1337
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,119
up the background of what's creating all

1338
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,160
these problems that we talked about in

1339
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:17,839
the

1340
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,280
show the liver cleans up all these

1341
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,960
backgrounds all the background garbage

1342
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,240
the background noise that's coming up

1343
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,559
that that no one wants to analyze the

1344
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,359
gunk inside a gallbladder and nobody

1345
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,839
wants to look into cuz it's like dirt

1346
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:32,520
looking in a dirty closet it's like the

1347
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,160
medical industry looking in a dirty

1348
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,119
closet and analyzing what's in there and

1349
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,839
be like how did that get in there oh it

1353
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:46,359
different industries that produce so
