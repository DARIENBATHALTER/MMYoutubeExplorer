1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
heavy metal pumped up about it

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,279

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,559

controls us more than we know

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,880
toxic heavy metals control our mind

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,119
i think that's why the industries

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,720
are even involved with it because they

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,199
are

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,279
the more toxic heavy metals that enter

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,000
our brain

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,800
the more chances

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,960
we're gonna screw up we're gonna screw

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
up

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,079
toxic heavy metals

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
causes more suicides

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,920
than people would even believe or know

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,800
heavy metals can create a depression

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,600
that's so devastating a mysterious

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,320
depression that's so devastating where

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,520
you can't seem to see

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,879
the light on any level

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,039
where

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,120
that depression

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,600
takes over

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,600
it takes over everything there's no hope

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,520
there's no

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,040
light

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,040
there's no sanctuary

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,680
there's no

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,320
anything when you're that severely

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,400
depressed

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,799
but yet the toxic heavy metals creating

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,479
that depression

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,479
can push somebody to suicide

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,680
toxic heavy metals

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,799
really show themselves when an elder

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200
gets

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,600
dementia

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,079
and you lose touch with that elder

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,000
that mother that father

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,000
that grandmother

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,360
that grandfather

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that great grandmother that great

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,240
grandfather

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
you lose touch with that person or that

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,600
best friend

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,159
where the best friend is

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,360
losing their mind

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,360
toxic heavy metals

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,479
can devastate lives

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,920
but yet

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
you don't hear anything really about

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,440
toxic heavy metals i spent 35 years

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
trying to teach people about toxic heavy

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,080
metals

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,840
so they know and now you kind of faintly

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,280
hear it amongst the

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,440
alternative health industry right and

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
they all give all the wrong stuff for it

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,319
like

61
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,680

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,160
terrifying

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,040
internally when you take charcoal

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160

and

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,959
what happens is that

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,519
that

they can confuse us to make us confused

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,840

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,960
i'm sorry mr smith i'm sorry mrs smith

196
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,960

got alcohol poisoning in his dead

198
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,639
toxic heavy metals

199
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,120
creates a lot of problems including

200
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,759
madness

201
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,360
madness

202
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,759
to the point where

203
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,840
terrible crimes are committed it takes

204
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,759
also a bad person don't get me wrong but

205
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,440
when you have toxic heavy metals in a

206
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,160
bad person that's when it goes really

207
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,160
downhill

208
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,319
you put toxic heavy metals in a good

209
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
person you'll get bad decisions and

210
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
wrong decisions and you'll get all kinds

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,599
of issues and all kinds of symptoms and

212
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,080
conditions and confusion amongst friends

213
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,639
and family around them making their life

214
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,560
difficult making the person suffering

215
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,360
difficult but if you stick toxic heavy

216
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,840
metals in a madman

217
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,479
then a war or something can happen you

218
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,599
stick toxic heavy metals in someone

219
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,000
who's just already batshit crazy and you

220
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,640
put metals in them it only compiles it

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,320
and makes it worse right

222
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,919
you stick toxic heavy metals in a

223
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,919
surgeon they're going to be extra

224
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,080
tremoring when they're cutting you open

225
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,920
okay but they don't want to retire

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,680
because they can't retire because they

227
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
need the money because surgeons still

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,440
have to work for a living so as they're

229
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,959
shaking a little bit and they're on all

230
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,720
their caffeine to control it and their

231
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,160
medications to control it the surgeon's

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,160
working on you and they got a tremor

233
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,839
condition because the toxic heavy metals

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
toxic heavy metals can change the

235
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,839
outcomes of people who are getting

236
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,760
surgeries done by doctors that got toxic

237
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,360
heavy metals inside of them toxic heavy

238
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,640
metals can change the outcome of all

239
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,399
everybody's lives for all these

240
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,519
different reasons

241
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,519
toxic heavy metals

242
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,800
can make it

243
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,040
where critical mistakes are made all the

244
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,959
time

245
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,640
so

246
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,080
is it important

247
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,720

i don't even know if i could even do

285
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,519
something as good as what they did

286
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,000
because for some reason

287
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,160
they're they they have the capacity to

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
fight for it i don't know if i have that

289
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,360
strength to fight for what they've done

290
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,440
the fight to make actually this stuff

291
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,680
the cleanest stuff on the planet

292
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,240
i mean of course i would fight but man

293
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,920
that's what i love about this stuff

294
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320
but if this company ever changes what

295
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,519
they're doing boom they're gone they

296
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,120
change what they're doing with their

297
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,720
products out of here i don't wanna i

298
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
don't you know what i mean

299
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,720
but anyway incredible stuff right now

300
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,079
it's the best stuff out there and they

301
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,959
made promises that they're not gonna

302
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,640
change

303
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,120
so you guys we're on tick tock right now

304
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,800
we're live there there's a question on

305
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
tick tock what's the difference between

306
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,399
blueberries and wild blueberries good

307
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
question you guys so what's the

308
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,279
difference between blueberries and wild

309
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,200
blueberries okay

310
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,880
a blueberry

311
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,640
is a cultivated fruit that still has

312
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,200
wonderful nutrients and some

313
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,600
antioxidants i love regular blueberries

314
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,680
if i see a pint of regular blueberries

315
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
i'll eat them absolutely they're good

316
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,279
for you they are

317
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,680
they're related they're related to its

318
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,079
cousin which is the real blueberry like

319
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,440
the wild blueberry right the wild

320
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,720
blueberry is a wild food that means that

321
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,880
the difference is when you're dealing

322
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
with the wild food is is remarkable the

323
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,240
antioxidants are off the chart they're

324
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,560
much higher anthocyanins much stronger

325
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,200
right that's just one thing the other

326
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,720
thing is adaptive

327
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
adaptive

328
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,240
you can burn the wild the blueberries

329
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,959
down to the ground and they'll come back

330
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,600
if you go and torch the cultivated

331
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,440
blueberry down to the ground

332
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
you see nothing

333
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,519
you see nothing come back

334
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,519
nothing comes back

335
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,279
and that's one of the big things right

336
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,880
there what that means is the wild

337
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,120
blueberry's got

338
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,320
thousands and thousands of years of

339
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,399
information in it to survive to beat out

340
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,600
stuff and that's what i want inside my

341
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:57,279
body i want something that has thousands

342
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,440
of years of information in it

343
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,320
in it

344
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,120
right

345
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,279
for survival survival because of what

346
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
we're up against now too

347
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,399
anyway that's just some reasons the wild

348
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,800
blueberry actually has the ability

349
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,760
to actually help with

350
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,200

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,920
bacon sausage breakfast egg breakfast

382
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,519
you do that then you're probably not

383
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,600
gonna flush much at all out of your

384
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,519
liver but if you start out with lemon

385
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,560
water first thing and it's all you do

386
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,920
you made a move man in your life you did

387
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,600
you made a big move right

388
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,800
so cut open the lemon

389
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,079
and i'm going to squeeze some lemon in

390
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,120
here right there

391
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,240
this is really hard to do

392
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,160
right

393
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,959
it's not hard to do

394
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,920
i'm being

395
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,959
hardly sarcastic i guess

396
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,959
i don't know what i'm being

397
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,480
done

398
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,240
that's step one right there you did it

399
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,560
even if it's just this at least you're

400
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,240
gonna get a little hydration and a flush

401
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,800
right in the morning especially if you

402
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,360
don't do any heavy fats in the morning

403
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,399
too so if you just do the lemon water in

404
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,199
the morning life starts to change

405
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,240
don't do hot lemon i know i did this

406
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,240
yesterday where no hot water no hot

407
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,880
you don't want to kill the lemon you

408
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,720
don't want to kill the

409
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,920
michelle l that's the best word for it

410
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,639
exactly

411
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,440
she's just yeah totally

412
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,600
so

413
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,160
you don't want to kill the living

414
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,639
phytochemical compounds inside

415
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,720
the lemon the lemon juice you don't want

416
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,639
to destroy that the living enzymes the

417
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,240
living water inside when a lemon's on a

418
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,320
tree or in the basket or at home in the

419
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
basket of the grocery store or at home

420
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,279
on your cutting board your lemon's still

421
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,680
alive it has it hasn't died

422
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,399
so when you do the hot water you kill

423
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,759
the lemon juice you kill it right so you

424
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,320
don't want to do that in order for that

425
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,440
hydration to happen it has to be raw

426
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,480
lemon juice you put it in hot water you

427
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,959
have cooked lemon juice which is fine if

428
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,959
you want a hot lemon tea so a little bit

429
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,720
of lemon balm tea you want some honey

430
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,240
you want some ginger tea you want to

431
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,160

432
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,440

thing you need is spirulina right do you

have a spirulina that's the one i like

476
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,039
that's the best one right there so

477
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,120
that's the vimorcy you'll see the little

478
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,280
vimergy label right there

479
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,600
there it is right there

480
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,799
so that's the vimorji right see if i can

481
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,400
get this straight how do you get this

482
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,440
straight

483
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,360
what

484
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,960
what there we are

485
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,039
that was that was weird that was

486
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,039
psychedelic i couldn't tell you right

487
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,400
now that was really psychedelic

488
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,559
all right

489
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,360
so that's the vimercy powder right there

490
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,679
so you need that now if you get another

491
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,960
if you get another spirulina

492
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,400
right

493
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,960
keep in mind it may not be as strong and

494
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,880
may not be as good it may not be as

495
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,160
clean and if that's the case you're

496
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,520
still using something and so that's good

497
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,760
okay

498
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,120
but that's the best one

499
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,880
it's barley grass juice powder let's see

500
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,120
if we get a close up on that one too so

501
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,640
the barley grass juice powder

502
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,919
right there you go

503
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,039
so that's the emergency barley cream now

504
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,320
this is important to know barley grass

505
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,840
don't make a mistake and get just barley

506
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,919
grass

507
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,760
don't do that you want barley grass

508
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,160
juice powder because here's how it works

509
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,679
barley grass you're just gonna poop out

510
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
you're just gonna poop the barley grass

511
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,679
out

512
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,880
that's all

513
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,600
it's just going to come out the other

514
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,679
end

515
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,760
that's what it's going to do

516
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,200
barley grass juice powder you're not

517
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,160
going to poop out

518
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,480
sure you might poop some out naturally

519
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
depending on how fast you poop after you

520
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,520
eat and stuff everybody's got a

521
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,919
different time span because of

522
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,520
peristaltic action issues and stuff but

523
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,240
the barley grass juice powder will

524
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,400
absorb and assimilate that will absorb

525
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,039
and assimilate and it'll get into your

526
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,360

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,039
cleaning up the liver too and when

566
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
you're cleaning up the liver and

567
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,960
removing all the toxic waste including

568
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,039
toxic heavy metals what happens is the

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
door opens the gate opens

570
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,120

eventually your liver gets better and

576
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,400
better and then boom the weight starts

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,640
years eating bananas

644
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,559
i love them you know what's funny about

645
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,559
the alternative industry

646
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,320
i hate bananas so much

647
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,760
they create all these diets around don't

648
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,120
have any sugar don't have any sugar and

649
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,080
stuff like that when they don't even get

650
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,360
it a banana is anti-viral

651
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,240
they don't even know why anybody's sick

652
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
and they're telling you not to eat a

653
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,400
banana

654
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,799
bananas have antiviral compounds in them

655
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,559
anti-pathogen compounds anti-mold

656
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,480
anti-yeast anti-everything meanwhile the

657
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,600
alternative industry has been putting

658
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,600
people into banana fare for years now

659
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,039
right i did a podcast episode on it

660
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,320
right medical media podcast apple

661
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,520
podcast

662
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,240
they try to put people in fear of

663
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,279
bananas like scared to death of a banana

664
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,760
right

665
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,240
and how ridiculous is that

666
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,159
they're children with autism and adhd

667
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,159
the doctors like don't eat bananas don't

668
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,720
give the kids sugar

669
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,919
it's it's psycho

670
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,159
meanwhile

671
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,320
your brain runs on sugar did you know

672
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,720
that if your brain doesn't receive sugar

673
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,039
within 10 seconds guess what it dies

674
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,720
it dies

675
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,480
the blood going to your brain is

676
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,240
traveling with glucose in it if you

677
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,919
don't get glucose to your brain why do

678
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,840
you think the old keto diet used to kill

679
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,279
people all the time you guys don't know

680
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,799
many well actually some of you guys

681
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,080
might have experienced watching this or

682
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,440
gone through it so i'm actually wrong

683
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,200
about that spirit just said you're wrong

684
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,559
there are some people that actually are

685
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,320
in the medical medium community that did

686
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,320
the old keto diet in the old way and

687
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,120
almost died

688
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,360
i love when spirit uh corrects me

689
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,200
it's like a school teacher it's like a

690
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,320
school teacher on my butt

691
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,279
every time

692
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,039
anyway so the whole point is

693
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,559
is that we need sugar to the brain so

694
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,720
now here's how the heavy metal detox

695
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,960
smoothie works it works

696
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,440
where there's glucose to travel a lot of

697
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,960
these nutrients

698
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,880
to the brain

699
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,520
to get the metals out that's where i was

700
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,520
going the whole point and and so where

701
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,039
i'm heading here is why do we do the

702
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,039
heavy metal detox movie

703
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,799
we do it because we're trying to get

704
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,080
metals out of the brain and glucose is a

705
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,000
big part of it and we make sure there's

706
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,240
ample glucose inside the smoothies what

707
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,240
we do all right i'm gonna put the banana

708
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,240
down

709
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,520
let's make some celery juice really

710
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,520
quick

711
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,840

712
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,919

713
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,640
here it's part of the cleanse if you

don't have a juicer use a blender then

715
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,600
strain it with a cheesecloth or a milk

716
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,279
nut milk bag and that's fine you can do

717
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,720
that you know

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,840
damaged for years

751
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,200
lydia says facebook stops

752
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,880
yeah that's whoa

753
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,559
they're just they just yeah we're

754
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,559
censored on facebook for some reason

755
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,960
because i'm talking about bananas

756
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,159
somebody in facebook probably doesn't

757
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,760
like the bananas because they've been

758
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,559
taught not to be bananas so they're like

759
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,159
oh i'll fix that medical medium let's

760
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,159
hit this button a couple more times and

761
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,159
knock off another bunch of people

762
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,919
just guess it

763
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,919
all right

764
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,720
so when it comes down to the heavy metal

765
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,799
detox smoothie it's really gentle it's

766
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,000
critical that it's that gentle sarah

767
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,679
says i just ordered the spare of the end

768
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,679
of barley grass juice powder amazing

769
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,679
amazing

770
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,480
making a little bit of solar juice so

771
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,080
celery juice neutralizes the toxins

772
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,200
and neutralizes metals it helps to

773
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:11,440
dislodge that

774
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,799
it creates a dislodging of purging now

775
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,120
celery juice does not bind onto metals

776
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,720
specifically and carry them completely

777
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,120
out of the body that's not celery

778
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,640
juice's role celery juice's role is to

779
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,640
neutralize metals

780
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,520
lower their strength and their toxic

781
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,799
nature

782
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,320
celery juice does bind on to metal

783
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,640
byproduct

784
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,320
that makes us sick that gives us a lot

785
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,320
of metal conditions and symptoms and

786
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,320
diseases

787
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,360
people get better just drinking celery

788
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,720
juice with the brain fog i hear it all

789
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,159
the time it's like oh my god my brain

790
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,880
fog so much better i'm doing celery

791
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,360
juice and part of that reason is because

792
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,120
the celery juice is removing

793
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,120
toxic heavy metal

794
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,000
by-product

795
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,000
by-product

796
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,240
that's different than the metal itself

797
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,159
but it's byproducts so celery is already

798
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,799
helping everybody with their metal

799
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,760
problems every single day

800
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,760
that's what's incredible

801
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,520
michelle l says it's a team effort

802
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,600
indeed it is the celery juice acts as

803
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,799
part of that as part of that team member

804
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,799
so it's really important

805
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,679
now listen some people have more toxic

806
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,760
heavy metals than others some people

807
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,240
have them deeper in the brain

808
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,440
keep that in mind some people have more

809
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,760
metals different kinds of metals

810
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,559
all that's important to know you

811
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,480
somebody else may not be doing anything

812
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,440
but the heavy metal detox smoothie and

813
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,120
they have a really bad case of metals

814
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,159
and they're not reading the details in

815
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,360
the book

816
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,679
about like

817
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,200
adding additional customizing protocols

818
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,399
and stuff

819
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,080
customizing is critical and that's what

820
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,080
medical medium information it's about

821
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,640
it's not one size fits all because

822
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,640
everyone has a different level of metals

823
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,080
and different circumstances with with

824
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,360
what they're dealing with in their

825
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,360
symptoms and conditions right

826
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,430
so there we go got some celery juice

827
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,679
right here

828
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,360
[Music]

829
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,520
hey w can you let us know how long it

830
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,039
can take to get metals out exactly what

831
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,840
i'm talking about right now yo fruits

832
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,360
and

833
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,200
vegetables that's a cool handle eo

834
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,279
fruits and vegetables so yeah so what

835
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,880
happens is that

836
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,919
a lot of people may have a lot of a lot

837
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,240
of different metals so let's go into

838
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,720
that a little bit okay so i got my brain

839
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,720
over here

840
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,159
one of my brains

841
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,080
right

842
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,440
somebody may have metals in the left

843
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,880
left hemisphere and not the right

844
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,720
hemisphere somebody may have them in the

845
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,240
left and right uh hemisphere somebody

846
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,679
may have them in the frontal lobe

847
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,519
everybody's got a different situation

848
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,399
with metals more people might have more

849
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,679
metal

850
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,679
other people might have more metal in

851
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,679
the brain stem

852
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,120
a lot of different situations

853
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,279
someone might have metals in the

854
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,760
emotional center of the brain

855
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,679
keep that in mind so we can have metals

856
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,840
in different areas some people may have

857
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,360
more mercury more leads somebody

858
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,039
somebody might have more aluminum more

859
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,720
copper somebody might have only copper

860
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,039
and a little bit of aluminum somebody

861
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,360
might have aluminum calcium

862
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,720
the bad one industrialized calcium

863
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,600
copper

864
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,159
lead arsenic cadmium and nickel somebody

865
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,120
might have just a ton of mercury

866
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,480
not literally a ton figuratively but a

867
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,480
lot of mercury

868
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,840
so that's the difference right there

869
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,360
okay and that's what changes

870
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,960
everything all right

871
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,960
so keep that in mind i see aj

872
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,399
all right we got some celery juice right

873
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,399
here

874
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,279
you guys we got some celery right here

875
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,279
i'm gonna pour it from the corner this

876
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,440
time see when i'm back here my juicer's

877
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,559
in the way so i actually have to

878
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,960
pour it from the corner

879
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,960
smart

880
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,200
just laughing at myself

881
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,159
like usual all right so we got some

882
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,159
celery juice right here

883
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,880
how do you test which heavy metals you

884
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,960
have good question let's answer it

885
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,760
let me just cap this off you guys right

886
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,519
here

887
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,519
yep thank you for asking that question

888
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,320
i'm going to move this down here just

889
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,320
give me one second

890
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,440
nice how do you test what metals that

891
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,440
you like what metals you have here's

892
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,840
here's how it works to begin with metals

893
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,360
sit inside organs so you can't test for

894
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,679
all the metals and you can't test for

895
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,279
every metal in the body it doesn't work

896
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,120
like that so that's important to know

897
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,640
right so

898
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,720
if you guys just came on here make sure

899
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,640
you have cleanse the heel when you can

900
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,600
get it free at the library

901
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,600
um amazon.com 51 off the heavy metal

902
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,440
detox cleanse is in here or day two of

903
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,960
the heavy metal detox cleanse challenge

904
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,200
so just so you know what we're doing

905
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,200
right

906
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,320
so when you get a heavy metal detox test

907
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,960
they're testing a quick snapshot of time

908
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,679
they're testing your blood a quick

909
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,519
snapshot of time is what they're doing

910
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,960
they're getting some blood in the moment

911
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,360
at that part of the body right

912
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,200
so when you're getting your blood tested

913
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,360
okay

914
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,039
if you ever have an ink have you ever

915
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,720
had a tattoo just assume you got toxic

916
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,240
heavy metals in the organs

917
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,519
because that's what the ink is it's got

918
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,279
all these metals in it we'll talk about

919
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,000
that in a second again

920
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,000
but if you had your blood tested

921
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,880
for toxic heavy metals it's a snapshot

922
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,480
it's just a window meanwhile metals can

923
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,000
build up in your organs for years but

924
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,599
you don't see it in the blood test so

925
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,119
when they do take a blood test and they

926
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,399
see some that's just what's floating

927
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,839
around in their bloodstream in that

928
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,000
moment

929
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,879
they can't go and do a brain biopsy on

930
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,159
you so they can't be like hold on mister

931
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,159
hold on mr wilson

932
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,960
we're going to see how many we're going

933
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,960
to knock you out under general

934
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,960
anesthesia

935
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,200
and uh

936
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,960
we're going to do a brain biopsy on you

937
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,879
right now don't worry we're gonna knock

938
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,720
you out okay we knocked you out you're

939
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,480
you're under anesthesia now let's just

940
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,599
cut open the skull and let's do a brain

941
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,040
biopsy

942
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,639
and we're gonna get that biopsy and now

943
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,159
we're gonna study that on how many heavy

944
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,760
metals you are you have and here's the

945
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,480
problem even with that so even if they

946
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,480
could do that

947
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,320
they're going to pick a spot in the

948
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,399
brain that the metals aren't even in

949
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,800
your metals can be located anywhere they

950
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,800
can be anywhere they can they can biopsy

951
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,960
the wrong side they can

952
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,720
the metals can be anywhere inside the

953
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,160
brain they can't go and dissect your

954
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,520
brain while you're under anesthesia

955
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,119
you'll never come out of it if they

956
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,960
dissect your brain and cut everything

957
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,400
open and look for it it's not going to

958
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,200
happen

959
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,079
so

960
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,160
it's impossible to measure metals is

961
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,040
what i'm trying to say unless you drank

962
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,320
a

963
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,480
a gallon of lead

964
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,320
lead water

965
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,240
and you had lead poisoning and you

966
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,839
literally were going into neurological

967
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,359
seizure and coma and you're in the

968
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,480
hospital they know you have lead

969
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,160
poisoning

970
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,680
they can test out lead really high in

971
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,920
your bloodstream because you just got

972
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,800
the lead but you but other than that if

973
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,800
we don't have that kind of exposure

974
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,680
then what we're dealing with is we never

975
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,520
know there is no analysis or test that

976
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,599
could determine how many metals we have

977
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,520
in every organ inside our brain inside

978
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,119
our liver or anything else

979
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,359
you start getting alzheimer's you got

980
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,680
metals really bad

981
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,680
a hair analysis doesn't do it do the

982
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,680
trick either

983
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,920
a hair analysis is not going to tell you

984
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,440
how much lead you have in your liver how

985
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,800
much mercury you have in different parts

986
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,880
of your brain how many how much

987
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,520
mercury's in your spleen how much

988
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,920
aluminum's in your pancreas how much

989
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,680
aluminum is underneath your derma how

990
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,720
like nothing like you're not gonna get

991
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,720
any answers for that

992
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,880
i'm just gonna since i brought this up

993
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,320
i'm not telling you to remove your

994
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,920
tattoos i saw a bunch of comments

995
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,480
yesterday and everybody's like oh crap i

996
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,400
gotta get my tattoos removed

997
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,800
you don't have to get your tattoos

998
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,280
removed you don't you just have to be

999
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,119
proactive on catching the metals as they

1000
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,480
leave your derma into your bloodstream

1001
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,079
because for the rest of your life

1002
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,839
they're gonna leave your derma into the

1003
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,119
bloodstream they're gonna soak down down

1004
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,200
through

1005
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,359
and if you go and get a tattoo today and

1006
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,280
you hop into like a hipster

1007
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,960
tattoo place

1008
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,200
you know it's real like like totally you

1009
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,880
know i don't know hollywood boulevard

1010
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,320
hipster tattoo place that you've been

1011
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,800
recommended to you because they got the

1012
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,560
best vegan non-cruelty ink

1013
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,320
you're just completely just you know

1014
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,320
you're you're it's distant for

1015
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,280
misinformation because there's no such

1016
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,359
thing

1017
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,599
you have to have metal in the ink to get

1018
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,640
that color to pop so light hits it and

1019
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,280
it pops

1020
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,359
you have to have that christie seriously

1021
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,640
i'm serious there is none

1022
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,640
so

1023
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,760
what happens is that you have to have

1024
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,680
it's all metal it's all metal

1025
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,920
it's all minerals

1026
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,920
but not the good kind so your ink is

1027
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,320
filled with all metal

1028
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,800
yeah i don't care who says we had ours

1029
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,599
tested there's no metals in it no no no

1030
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,680
no both i call bs

1031
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,680
i call bs

1032
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,960
industrialized metals and they're

1033
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,920
they're they're

1034
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,599
it's fine particles it's nano it's

1035
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,640
actually under it's like septo

1036
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,079
it's like septo right

1037
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,640
so you need to know that

1038
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,320
that metal is like septo size

1039
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,359
so that's what it is that's an entirely

1040
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,920
different size right that's crazy small

1041
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,680
so what it is is that's what is inside

1042
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,680
the ink and that's what makes the light

1043
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,000
hit it so you hit the the light goes and

1044
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,839
hits your skin and then it pops so you

1045
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,240
guys will give you a rundown now and

1046
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,119
everything

1047
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,400
all right

1048
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,599
let's do it

1049
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,520
16 to 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water you

1050
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,000
guys know the drill wait 15 to 30

1051
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,000
minutes going to 16 to 32 ounces of

1052
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,680
celery juice

1053
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,480
wait

1054
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,160
another 15 to 30 minutes

1055
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,680
get your smoothie going that's what

1056
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,000
we're going to do right now

1057
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,160
smoothie time

1058
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,720
let's have some fun

1059
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,960
where are my bananas

1060
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,640
right here

1061
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,480
we got the bananas we're going to throw

1062
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,920
a couple of bananas in here

1063
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,079
okay

1064
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,920
glucose

1065
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,240
delivers

1066
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,079
the phytochemical compounds and the

1067
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,880
antioxidants and everything else that

1068
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,000
have to get to your brain and liver and

1069
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,440
other organs you gotta have the banana

1070
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,440
don't be afraid of banana

1071
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,400
unless you hate banana then okay put

1072
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,560
mango in there

1073
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,079
you hate banana but man

1074
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,560
here's the thing like all these

1075
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,880
alternatives are in here

1076
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,200
just so you know they're all in here

1077
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,520
on what you can do that's what's amazing

1078
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,520
okay

1079
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,800
all right so we got a couple of bananas

1080
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,760
in there let's get the wild blueberries

1081
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,839
in here here are the wild blueberries

1082
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,599
right here

1083
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,160
that's why blueberry time

1084
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,160
here we go

1085
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,280
put about two cups in here

1086
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:45,359
so i'm dropping that in here you guys

1087
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,119
right frozen wild blueberries

1088
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,400
if you don't have wild blueberries use

1089
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,560
blackberries but they're not going to do

1090
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,119
the same thing but it's the closest

1091
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,680
thing we can we can use if you don't

1092
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,839
have an option the key is to have three

1093
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,359
out of these five ingredients if

1094
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:03,440
possible shoot for three out of five

1095
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,280
shoot for four out of five shoot for

1096
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,560
five out of five would be really

1097
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,880
incredible

1098
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,440
but if you only have three out of five

1099
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,960
that's what you have then

1100
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,800
we got the wild blueberry in there

1101
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,319

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,880

some barley grass juice powder next

1159
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,720
right here

1160
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,240
medical medium info is about going as

1161
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,839
far as you need to go when you want to

1162
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,200
go and when you want to do it it's about

1163
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,680
going as far as you want to go

1164
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,200
and when

1165
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,200
yes let's talk about the lymphatic

1166
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,640
system once i get this smoothie going i

1167
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,079
want to talk about the lymphatic system

1168
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,680
there's a lot of misinformation about

1169
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,520
the lymphatic system out there and quite

1170
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,880
frankly it's it's kind of embarrassing

1171
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,880
at this point

1172
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,960
and and and a nuisance too because it

1173
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,440
interferes with people's healing so i

1174
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,800
can't wait to cover that for a minute

1175
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,400
so i'm going to put

1176
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,760
now the dulce liquid

1177
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,960
right there

1178
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,079
i'm going to put a shot of that in

1179
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,760
you could do one or two dropper fulls

1180
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,520
i might even throw a little whole piece

1181
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,400
in there too just a little whole piece

1182
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,599
of

1183
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,760
there we go

1184
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,920
right

1185
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,359
and then

1186
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,800
i'm going to put a little bit of this in

1187
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,920
here too i mean people that don't even

1188
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,599
have the wild blueberries but they can

1189
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,599
get a hold of a wild blueberry juice

1190
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,760
that's that's the way to go right

1191
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,200
you can go do that option

1192
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,960
it doesn't mean go to the store and buy

1193
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,560
a blueberry juice because the blueberry

1194
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,800
juice is not going to be the same thing

1195
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,720
it's going to be wild blueberry

1196
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,720
now you guys know i do work

1197
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,400

1200
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,800
because the process of what they do i'm

1201
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,960
supportive 100 i endorse them i work

1202
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,440

1203
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,960
little bit in there right

i like to take a swig of that right now

1205
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,920
all right

1206
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,359
i think we got what we need in here

1207
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,200

1210
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,400
and we'll talk about the lymphatic

1211
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,200
system for a couple of minutes let's

1212
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,200
turn this puppy on

1213
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,839
here we go

1214
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,359
all right

1215
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,359
let's get the blender off before we

1216
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,119
all right

1217
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,520
that's why we're live

1218
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,119
[Music]

1219
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,119

1220
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,119
kitchen

1221
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,870

[Applause]

1226
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,599
only person out there that clarifies who

1227
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,119
they work with the transparency and

1228
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,119
honesty

1229
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,119

the anti anti-madness creator

that's what this is

1248
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,599
about getting people's lives back on

1249
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,359
track getting them out of ocd getting

1250
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,880
them out of bipolar getting them out of

1251
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,280
the personalization getting them out of

1252
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,480
anxiety depression

1253
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,319
all of it getting them out of just

1254
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,000
a deep sense of sadness and they don't

1255
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,839
know why they have the sadness i've

1256
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,440
watched for years i've watched for years

1257
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,119
something that happens to people like

1258
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,640
they have this deep sense of sadness

1259
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,160
they they're not sure if it's a

1260
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,640
depression but they don't really know

1261
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,480
they just it's a sense of like

1262
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,160
sadness right so then they go to a

1263
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,280
therapist and the therapist is trying to

1264
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,960
crack them

1265
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,800
so then the therapist is trying to crack

1266
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,880
them tell me about your life

1267
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,560
like whoa i'm like this is what i do

1268
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,000
this is what i you know this is my life

1269
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,960
and i'm like okay well let's find out

1270
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,079
where the problem is right there's

1271
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,200
nothing wrong with that right you go to

1272
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,800
the therapist

1273
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,240
and then there's that therapist the deep

1274
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,440
sense of sadness doesn't end up

1275
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,040
resolving so now they're at a

1276
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,400
psychiatrist right then they're then

1277
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,839
then from there they're at their doctor

1278
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,599
and that doctor's doing a work up and

1279
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,000
taking blood out of them and more blood

1280
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,680
out of them and making them sicker right

1281
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,040
and then now they're going from the

1282
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,400
doctor to another doctor but they have

1283
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,000
this deep sense of sadness right and

1284
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,319
then their family's like why are you so

1285
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,040
sad why are you so sad then they go find

1286
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,960
a psychic

1287
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,880
and then the psychic says that they're

1288
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,119
sad because in their past life they had

1289
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,839
their head chopped off under queen

1290
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,000
victoria of whatever year and whatever

1291
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,960
whatnot or they were burned alive at the

1292
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,800
stake as a witch or their sadness is

1293
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,480
because they were on the titanic and

1294
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,079
they went down the titanic went down and

1295
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,599
they were one of the people that died on

1296
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,720
the titanic in their past lives and

1297
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,880
that's why they have this deep sadness

1298
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,480
meanwhile the whole time

1299
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,920
it's toxic heavy metals eating away at

1300
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,280
their brain and that sadness becomes

1301
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,800
something worse down the road unless

1302
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,160
they address the toxic heavy metals and

1303
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,240
something worse than something worse so

1304
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,000
then when they have a real serious

1305
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,559
problem down the road with their brain

1306
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,119
20 years down the road okay and now it's

1307
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,119
serious like some serious craps going on

1308
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,599
no one knew it was a toxic heavy metals

1309
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,200
but they thought all these years is

1310
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,320
because of one of their past lives they

1311
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:22,540
died on the titanic

1312
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,540
[Music]

1313
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,280

1314
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,800
metal detox cleanse

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,240
okay snap on some apples we're gonna

1316
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,599
talk about the lymphatic system let's

1317
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,920
run across that with a little bit

1318
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,280
lymphatic system

1319
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,720
we're on it

1320
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,800
oh

1321
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,760
very careful the guts of this dummy just

1322
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,760
fall right out

1323
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,240
okay

1324
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,800
lymphatic system time you'll see some

1325
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,800
lymphatic vessels somewhere right here

1326
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,800
say the lymphatic vessels here

1327
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,280
some little lymph nodes some lymphatic

1328
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,400
vessels there we are right

1329
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,000
if you hear

1330
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,839
from facebook groups that are not

1331
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,760
authentic facebook groups of medical

1332
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,960
medium where it's not the medical medium

1333
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,480
authentic

1334
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,079
right

1335
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,599
facebook group and you've got these so

1336
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,319
what happens is you get medical medium

1337
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,599
fans that eventually create

1338
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:19,359
not all of them do this but they

1339
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,880
eventually create a facebook group right

1340
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,800
over the years

1341
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,599
they create a facebook group and then

1342
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,040
they start changing everything they

1343
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:31,200
start trying to indoctrinate the people

1344
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,640
coming in they make it look like it's

1345
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,079
all medical medium they make it look

1346
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,160
like medical medium doesn't know what

1347
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,079
he's talking about anymore and they just

1348
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,720
get people in so they can sell all their

1349
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,720
stuff right all their lymphatic tonics

1350
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,880
and all kinds of crazy stuff and then

1351
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,240
what happens is people go into the group

1352
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,920
the group gets bigger and bigger and

1353
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,240
bigger and it becomes kind of like this

1354
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,079
half-like medical medium yeah i kind of

1355
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,200
like them in this half i kind of hate

1356
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,839
them

1357
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,920
and it becomes this group that is just a

1358
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,640
smorgasbord of like nothing but

1359
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,040
misinformation some haters

1360
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,559
some naysayers people don't even read

1361
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,400
the books or the medical medium books

1362
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,440
they never even read any of the books

1363
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,200
and it becomes this just big colossal

1364
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,240
cluster

1365
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,760
and that's what it is right

1366
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,440
and so

1367
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,359
in these groups in some of these groups

1368
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,800
under each other you're saying yes yes

1369
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,000
yes you've seen this over and over again

1370
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,839
yeah i know

1371
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,839
so i just have to bring this up because

1372
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,319
here's one of the colossal screw-ups

1373
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,240
that are happening now is

1374
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,599
you can't do the heavy metal detox

1375
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,760
cleanse unless you cleanse your

1376
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,680
lymphatic system get lymphatic drainage

1377
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,119
and lymphatic massage that's the most

1378
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,880
ridiculous thing i've ever heard in my

1379
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,680
life

1380
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,920
and so people will be like wait a minute

1381
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,119
i'm afraid do i even start the heavy

1382
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,480
metal ones meanwhile the person's

1383
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,079
suffering they got anxiety they got

1384
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,640
depression they got all kinds of

1385
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,200
problems they're sick they got you mean

1386
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,200
i can't do the heavy metal detox cleanse

1387
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,920
unless i do what with my lymphatic

1388
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,000
system buy your lymphatic products

1389
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,839
okay so i'm in this new facebook group

1390
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,160
right now and i'm gonna now buy all your

1391
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,559
lymphatic system products too let me

1392
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,559
spend a fortune a thousand dollars on

1393
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,160
all of your lymphatic products because

1394
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,319
you're telling me i can't do the heavy

1395
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,400
metal detox movie unless i clear my

1396
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,119
lymphatic system

1397
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,280
and oh by the way i better pay for and

1398
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,960
buy your program too your thousand

1399
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,720
dollar program that i'm gonna have to

1400
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,559
buy as well because you seem to know

1401
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,079
more than the medical medium does

1402
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,599
because the medical medium is not saying

1403
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,040
that you have to cleanse and drain and

1404
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,559
do this with your lymphatic system

1405
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,319
before doing the heavy metal detox

1406
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,760
smoothie

1407
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,520
and that's the information out there

1408
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,400
that goes screwed up happens in all

1409
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,400
these

1410
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,920
places dana white

1411
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,359
says it's because they're selling a

1412
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,119
lymphatic reset program 100 true right

1413
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,800
so what you have is you have all these

1414
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,440
like i used to call baby sharks but

1415
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,040
right now i just call basically just

1416
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,520
i don't know what name i could name them

1417
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,280
now right i don't want to like

1418
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,720
you know how you're just like you just

1419
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,240
you don't want to stoop down to their

1420
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,599
level you guys know it's right you don't

1421
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,960
want to stoop down to your level and be

1422
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,880
like say something really bad

1423
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,839
right but when their intention is really

1424
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,680
dark

1425
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,920
and they're misleading people and they

1426
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,599
stare people off off the deep end

1427
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,960
instead they're the wrong direction and

1428
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,800
they end up not helping them but they

1429
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,880
want to sell them their whatever

1430
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,960
you can't you know you it's it's just

1431
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,640
crazy how it works right

1432
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,839
but they use medical medium to bring

1433
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,200
these people down so they're using

1434
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,559
medical medium to bring these people

1435
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,160
down they use medical medium to lure

1436
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,240
them in and then they use medical medium

1437
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,960
to bring them down right so let's talk

1438
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,960
about the lymphatic system

1439
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,720
the heavy metal detox cleanse or

1440
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,240
smoothie and celery juice

1441
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,440
or lemon water

1442
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,440
is cleaning up your liver

1443
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,200
when you clean up your liver the

1444
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,280
lymphatic system automatically gets

1445
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,160
cleaned up so your lymphatic system

1446
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,680
automatically gets cleaned up

1447
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,760
anything you're doing for your lymphatic

1448
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,000
system doesn't fix the problem

1449
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,359
it doesn't and no one even can measure

1450
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,520
if it's helping the lymphatic system

1451
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,359
they can't see your lymphatic system

1452
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,440
you can take a lymphatic system tonic

1453
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,920
it's not going to fix it or help it

1454
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,760
there's no anything that shows

1455
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,000
that it would or could

1456
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,280
it's someone's idea i guess out there

1457
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,760
that oh lymphatic system this will help

1458
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,440
so the point is is that they'll tell you

1459
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,559
you can't start the metal cleanse or

1460
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,440
anything unless you address the

1461
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,040
lymphatic system right it's false

1462
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,280
information of the worst kind and it's

1463
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,440
misleading first of all the heavy metal

1464
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,960
detox smoothie that you would drink if

1465
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,720
you're doing this to see this metal

1466
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,800
smoothie right there

1467
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,559
goes into the liver and it starts to

1468
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,400
restore it

1469
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,839
as your liver is restoring the lymphatic

1470
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,599
system is automatically restoring

1471
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,680
because your lymphatic system is going

1472
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,000
to be

1473
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,520
not great because your liver is stagnant

1474
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,359
and sluggish it's the dumping ground so

1475
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,520
your lymphatic system is the trash

1476
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,319
ground for a bad liver for a liver

1477
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,760
that's stagnant and sluggish and dirty

1478
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,280
so when you're doing the heavy metal

1479
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,359
detox

1480
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,880
you're cleaning up

1481
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,960
right your liver

1482
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,640
so then the sewer system lymphatic

1483
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,800
system gets cleaned up automatically

1484
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:08,079
that's the whole point so by saying no

1485
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:10,000
you have to buy my lymphatic program

1486
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,760
and you have to subscribe and buy all my

1487
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,200
stuff and products and lymphatic before

1488
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,280
you can even do medical medium because

1489
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,280
medical medium doesn't know

1490
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,160
he doesn't know better i know better

1491
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,880
than him so i'm gonna sell you my my

1492
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,160
lymphatic programs right

1493
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,920
and that's where the confusion gets

1494
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,520
right there it's really terrible

1495
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,440
and

1496
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,200
i get it you know

1497
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,280
there's a lot of sharks baby sharks out

1498
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,800
there that's what it is lots of them a

1499
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,720
lot of baby sharks in the medical mean

1500
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,799
community that healed from medical

1501
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,760
medium information they're still using

1502
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:43,599
it now but then they leave and they kick

1503
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,200
like they kick medical medium down as

1504
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,040
they're leaving they step on them and

1505
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,799
spit on them and then they go because

1506
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,280
they're just like no i want to sell my

1507
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,599
whatever my ionizer water machine i want

1508
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,079
to sell my fulvic acid i want to sell my

1509
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,520
humic acid i want to sell my shilajit i

1510
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,920
want to sell them whatever i'm going to

1511
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,240
mlm into

1512
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,400
so the liver is just the lymphatic

1513
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,319
system is an overflow of your liver so

1514
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,599
your liver has to clean up and that's

1515
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,280
what this does so when you do your

1516
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,000
celery juice you do your lemon water

1517
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,000
right here and you do your your heavy

1518
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,680
metal detox smoothie right or if you're

1519
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,280
just using a little bit of spirulina

1520
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,720
every day or however you want to do it

1521
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,480
and customize the way you want to do

1522
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,799
you're cleaning up your liver inevitably

1523
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,960
it cleans up your lymphatic system is

1524
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:27,119
what it does

1525
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,960
key information right there just so you

1526
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,200
know

1527
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,200
so

1528
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:36,799
you'll see this out there all the time

1529
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,799
and the problem is they won't get

1530
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:40,960
censored but i will so facebook will

1531
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,559
censor me but facebook won't censor them

1532
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,240
so their group gets bigger and bigger

1533
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,559
with the misinformation

1534
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:49,440
and that's the way life works but i

1535
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:52,240
think darkness just finds its way to

1536
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,559
kind of like create these situations

1537
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,799
and it's just it's it's interesting

1538
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:59,200
but hey we work for the light and we got

1539
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,040
to remember that okay the other thing

1540
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,040
too is these other places they become

1541
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,720
cults you know so what happens is they

1542
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,200
become cults

1543
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,200
in so many ways because they're the ones

1544
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,839
making all these darn roles they're

1545
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,119
making roles that are like

1546
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:16,160
crazy

1547
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,839
and you have to pay in those cults right

1548
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,880
you have to pay that's how crazy it

1549
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,160
works too

1550
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,480
because now you're in fear and you

1551
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,319
better get that lymphatic protocol

1552
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,319
programmed for a thousand dollars you

1553
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,599
better get something out you know what i

1554
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:31,119
mean and that's how just so you think

1555
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:33,119
they prey on sick people

1556
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,280
and that's that's what happens

1557
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,799
when your lymphatic system

1558
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,520
when your liver gets really really

1559
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:41,359
sluggish and stagnant and really dirty

1560
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,119
and it's dumping in into your

1561
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,720
bloodstream and it's dumping into

1562
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,319
everything it's not just

1563
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,480
a lymphatic system when your liver is

1564
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,559
really dirty it overflows and it dumps

1565
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,680
into everything and then we get

1566
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,880
sensitive

1567
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,400
and sensitive and people get sensitive

1568
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,680
and it's not even the lymphatic system

1569
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,040
causing a problem that's the other

1570
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,799
problem so people don't realize that

1571
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,640
their lymphatic system is not giving

1572
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,160
them any problems

1573
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,599
they're sick from nervous system

1574
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,040
problems they're sick from vagus nerve

1575
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,559
problems they're sick from neurological

1576
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,760
issues they're sick from pathogens

1577
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,359
they're sick from all these things

1578
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,400
they're not sick because their lymphatic

1579
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:16,480
system is an issue that's another reason

1580
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,559
why it's so screwed up of what they're

1581
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,400
doing they're trying to get someone kind

1582
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,000
of mental about their lymphatic system

1583
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,440
when their lymphatic system has nothing

1584
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,720
to do with why they're sick to begin

1585
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,240
with and has nothing to do with why

1586
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,040
they're sensitive nothing to do with why

1587
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,960
they're neurologically feeling pain and

1588
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,480
their suffering nothing to do with their

1589
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,559
symptoms nothing to do with their

1590
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:38,000
anxiety or anything like that

1591
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,680
nothing you can have somebody

1592
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
got somebody with a real lymphatic

1593
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,160
problem like severe lymphoedema

1594
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,760
right some something separate

1595
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,200
you have somebody with that and they

1596
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,640
won't have anxiety they won't have

1597
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,559
anything else they won't have any of

1598
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,480
these problems doesn't mean so what they

1599
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,839
do is they take all these symptoms and

1600
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,960
conditions everybody's suffering with

1601
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:58,880
and then they'll say whoa i can totally

1602
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,880
i can manipulate them saying this is a

1603
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,599

lymphatic system or something and i

1608

00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:30,079
angelic intervention i believe the

1648
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,200
angels intervened with amazon

1649
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:36,960
to cut the book so low in price

1650
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:39,040
regardless of whatever happens whether i

1651
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,799
can keep lights on or not

1652
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,319

utilities going

1654
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:46,400
it doesn't matter i really think it's

1655
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,319
angelic intervention they made the price
