you guys and you're hanging on to this

61
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399

and you're literally doing everything

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,079
you can you're struggling to climb

64
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,920
you're climbing you're getting to the

65
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,200
top right and right when you get to the

66
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,319
edge of the cliff and you finally get

67
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
your hands over it

68
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,400
someone smacks you in the head and then

69
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
you

70
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,760

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,000
you're on the ground

72
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,879
or you fell off the cliff completely and

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000

from this patient we didn't prepare her

220
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,599

221
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,759
peer pressure protocol

222
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:39,120
it's about peer pressure what who

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,759
what what happened they hit the ground

224
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,360
after they had the blood drawn what

225
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,000
would happen they took they were walking

226
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,319

227
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,919

307
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,200
you can do a cholesterol off of that

308
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,079
40 years later someone who was who was

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,959
and they found jeans in a mud pit and

311
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,519
they pulled the genes out of a mud pit

312
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
and it stayed in the forensic flab for

313
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
40

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
years right at the police station or

315
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,360
wherever it was going to be and they can

316
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,760
take a q-tip and they can just find this

317
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
one

318
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,160
little speck take it and you get the a1c

319
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,760
out of it you can get an anti-nuclear

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,079

322
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,120
what it is there's a massive blood scam

323
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,480
i really believe it's done on purpose i

324
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,880
do i believe

325
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,720
the blood is not just being thrown away

326
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,200
but i believe the blood hits the black

327
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,000
market

328
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,320
is what i do i believe it hits the black

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,279
market for all kinds of sinister things

330
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,399
at this point

331
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,240
because why would they take that much

332
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,640
millions and millions of gallons of

333
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,959
blood you know what it is

334
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,000
it's like it's it's it's a precious

335
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,279
resource but

336
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,160

340
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,600
it's it's a it's not precious it's not

341
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,959

342
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,680

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,519
it works

376
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,079
it's really really bad you guys so let's

377
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,320
cut let's

378
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,680
let's go into this one truth bombs truth

379
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,959
bombs are critical

380
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,639
they're critical right it's about

381
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,240
protecting the chronic leo it's about

382
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,680
protecting people it's about protecting

383
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,959
people's lives

384
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,480
it's about making sure you don't get

385
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,600
hurt because the system is set up

386
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,600
for you to get hurt every day

387
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,440
in it that's how the system set up is

388
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,200
for you to get hurt that's how it is

389
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,720
the alternative movement is set up for

390
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,720
you to get hurt too and that's what

391
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,360
we're talking about the pitfall

392
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,079
lowers your immune system so the blood

393
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
draw

394
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,160
lowers your immune system that's one of

395
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,639
the pitfalls right

396
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,360
okay what's another pitfall hcl

397
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,600
supplements

398
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,639
thinking it's going to help your hcl

399
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,639
meanwhile

400
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,320
scorching your own stomach glands

401
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,680
i've always talked about hcl supplements

402
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,839
being really bad

403
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,760
because they they aren't your natural

404
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,920
gastric juices

405
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,800
you know produced by your own stomach

406
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,720
glands

407
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,160
so when you take the hydrochloric acid

408
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,560
supplements you

409
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
burn your stomach you burn your gut you

410
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
burn your duodenum

411
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,959
that's not your hcl from a human being

412
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,120
that from your actual glands themselves

413
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,519
dr fun he's not saying don't do blood

414
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
tests he says do less but you have to

415
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,240
self

416
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,680
advocate listen to the podcast medical

417
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,839
meeting podcast at apple pod

418
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,639
podcast blood draw uh uh blood draw

419
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,040
which was the name of that podcast oh

420
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,440
and vampirism right blood test blood

421
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,639
drop

422
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,920
vampirism right um and bloodletting

423
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,639
that's the other thing so the bottom

424
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
line is

425
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,720
listen to that episode blood droplet

426
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,399
letting vampirism get get to know it's

427
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
an important one i'm not against blood

428
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,360
draw i'm not against your

429
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,560
blood test i'm not against you getting a

430
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,480
blood test but this is critical to know

431
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,440
critical to know cindy lou good to see

432
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,920
you this is critical

433
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,680
information to protect you yeah it's

434
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,959
that important right

435
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,639
it's vampirism it's vampirism you know

436
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,320
this day and age let's talk about this i

437
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,160
did the hcl for a couple of seconds

438
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
letting you guys know the hcl that they

439
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,120
give you

440
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
and say hey take this hydrochloric acid

441
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,639
supplement because alternative medicine

442
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
is a bunch of pitfalls too a tremendous

443
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,760
amount of pitfalls so

444
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
the hcl supplements i've seen that

445
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,920
damage people over the years

446
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,600
i really have so you got to look out you

447
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,000
don't want to be doing the hcl

448
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,639
supplements because it's damaging

449
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,639
and how is it damaging it scorches your

450
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,360
own stomach glands it scorches your own

451
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,000
stomach

452
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,040
lining scorches your duodenum it's not

453
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,440
the same thing

454
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,079
as your own stomach glands producing

455
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,279
gastric

456
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,839
acid a specific blend i talk about

457
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,839
in medical medium new edition right here

458
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,040
where i talk about the seven

459
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,720
blend gastric acid right so

460
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,720
when they give you hydrochloric acid

461
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,240
supplements that's not the seven

462
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,279
blend of hcl narashini good to see you

463
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,240
um we need to take we need to be vampire

464
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,560
slayers

465
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,680
uh yeah that's really funny lunell hey

466
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,440
what's happening

467
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,279
you called me live i'm glad i caught you

468
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,800

469
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,279
to be here

470
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,000
um so it's important to know that that

471
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,240
hcl

472
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,480
is the bad stuff right the hydrochloric

473
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
acid supplements that's a pitfall all on

474
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
its own

475
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,519
let's hit more pitfalls what's another

476
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,639
one right there sodium bicarbonate

477
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:14,959
that's a that's a pitfall all in its own

478
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:19,120
it is an intestinal liner irritant

479
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,160
it harms all of our good microorganisms

480
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,839
and if we're all about good

481
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,800
microorganisms if we're all about good

482
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,079
bacteria

483
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,560
good microorganic organisms that sodium

484
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,120
bicarbonate

485
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:34,839
annihilates good bacteria

486
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,839
annihilates important good

487
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,399
microorganisms annihilates

488
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,920
these things a beneficial fungus we need

489
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,759
to survive we have beneficial

490
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,399
fungusiness that's how we stay alive

491
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,120
right

492
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,079
that's how we absorb right well sodium

493
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,600
bicarbonate

494
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,440
holds no bar just goes right in there

495
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,560
holds no quarter

496
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,120
goes in there and it starts to it starts

497
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,040
to

498
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,920
uh injure our good microorganisms not to

499
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,240
mention

500
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,520
total irritant on the lining of the

501
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,439
intestinal tract

502
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,360
small intestinal tract large intestinal

503
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,439
tract that's something right there

504
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,880
never liked one one bit if you guys just

505
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,919
came on making the banana cherry

506
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,199
smoothie i'm talking about all the

507
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
pitfalls i'm talking about all the

508
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,679
supplements

509
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,360
all the different stuff that's out there

510
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,280
the trends the trendy traps

511
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,120
karen says so what can we replace sodium

512
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,880
bicarbonate with

513
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,960
uh you're just you just don't need it

514
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,280
there's nothing that you have to replace

515
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,120
sodium bicarbonate with because sodium

516
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,559
bicarbonate isn't something that's

517
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,360
giving you something

518
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,000
internally so it's not providing

519
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,520
anything

520
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,120
for you right so you use it for baking

521
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,720
you know that's what you could do i

522
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,320
guess but it's not if that's what you

523
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,679
wanted to do but i wouldn't recommend

524
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,880
look i wouldn't recommend

525
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,520
using it internally is is the whole

526
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,559
point

527
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,000
so this is about ingesting it

528
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,360
right you know you can bake without it

529
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,960
too you can bake without sodium

530
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,600
bicarbonate but you don't need

531
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,960
sodium bicarbonate so replacing sodium

532
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,840
bicarbonate isn't so

533
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,320
okay so all right it's almost like if

534
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,600
you

535
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,520
well it's almost like arsenic right you

536
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,039
you're not supposed to be drinking

537
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,960
arsenic

538
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,559
so if someone says hey don't drink

539
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,559
arsenic what can you replace it with

540
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,320
i don't know what i mean it's not like

541
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,640
somebody okay something like say

542
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,080
you love whiskey it's like stop drinking

543
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,919
whiskey because it's going to hurt

544
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,160
your liver it's going to hurt you what

545
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,039
do i replace whiskey with

546
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,559
uh vodka no you don't want to replace

547
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,840
you're not trying to replace it you're

548
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,280
not trying to replace it but it's a good

549
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,679
question

550
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,799
so anyway let's move on to another one

551
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,360
too

552
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,280
i'm talking about sodium bicarbonate um

553
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,760
put it this way i've seen people with

554
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,280
crohn's colitis celiac digestive

555
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,360
problems bloating

556
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,080
dump a bunch of sodium bicarbonate in

557
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,919
and literally be in fetal position

558
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,520
and have to go to the emergency room

559
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,360
they're at the er now

560
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,960
and now they're going through the whole

561
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,200
stages of the er

562
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,360
they're waiting there waiting to see a

563
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,720
doctor doctor doesn't understand their

564
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,000
condition anyway

565
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,600
they've already been diagnosed with

566
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
crohn's and doctors like well crohn's

567
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,880
will whatever

568
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,720
we'll you know have you you know maybe

569
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,320
we can give you a medication tonight and

570
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,240
send you home with and

571
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,000
this person's suffering and they got and

572
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,760
they did the whole sodium bicarbonate

573
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,200
i've seen this over and over again

574
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,880
let's head to another one iron

575
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,480
supplements gotta be careful with iron

576
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,559
supplements because when people are low

577
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,480
in iron you have to keep this in mind

578
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,000
if the iron supplements aren't really

579
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,200
natural like really

580
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
clean like really like derived from a

581
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,720
good source

582
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,120
like with me with iron supplements with

583
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,480
me

584
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,240
is that i like to recommend foods that

585
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,440
are always high in iron right

586
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,559
with the leafy greens right um

587
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,919
the i like some raisins you know i like

588
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,360
wild blueberries i like things that have

589
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,000
the iron in it

590
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,840
which are important right the herbs it's

591
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,400
another thing too the cilantro

592
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,240
parsley i love i love the foods that

593
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,720
have the iron in there right

594
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
that's a whole thing too it's it's the

595
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,400
reason why we go

596
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,720
low in iron is because we're also

597
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,720
low-grade viral infections so

598
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,640
we got the viruses right so that's

599
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,520
another thing all in its own

600
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,320
you got the viruses and viruses like

601
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,520
epstein-barr

602
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,240
feed off of iron so that's why the iron

603
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,960
drops

604
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,960
because the viruses feed off of iron so

605
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,880
we have to be cautious right

606
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,200
so you keep if you're if you know if the

607
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,880
doctor is giving you all these iron

608
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,240
supplements and stuff care and churchill

609
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,120
iron supplements help

610
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,080
keep me anemic right helped keep me

611
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,640
anemic

612
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,480
so you got to be cautious with iron

613
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
supplements because iron supplements

614
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,000
cause a lot of trouble with a lot of

615
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,000
people what it does is

616
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,679
the symptoms can get worse when you're

617
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,480
dumping in a lot of iron supplements

618
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,400
because

619
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
it's fuel for certain varieties of

620
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
epstein-barr virus they love to feed off

621
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,840
of iron so then

622
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,280
you're dumping more iron in and then the

623
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,880
virus are eating more and how you're

624
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,240
getting more body aches and pains you're

625
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,360
getting a little bit more fatigue and

626
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,480
the doctor's just like well you're

627
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,000
getting more fatigue because you're

628
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,799
anemic meanwhile the doctor is supposed

629
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,880
to be saying

630
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,039
you're getting more fatigue because of

631
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,440
low-grade viral infections

632
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,799
and and and but they don't say that and

633
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,760
that's the whole thing on it's all on

634
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,760
its own

635
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,159
dolly says i take a tiny bit of sodium

636
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,440
bicarbonate occasionally it eases my

637
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,280
acid burn

638
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,080
i use apples too however i notice less

639
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,880
reflux with iodine as prescribed by dr

640
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,880
brownstein

641
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,440
iodine protocol so what i like to do for

642
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,919
reflux is i like to fix the problem

643
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,200
so that's what i like to do because acid

644
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,240
reflux is

645
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
streptococcus bacteria staph bacteria

646
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,360
it's e coli bacteria it's a lot of

647
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,840
bacteria

648
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,480
acid reflux is also a stagnant sluggish

649
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,280
liver

650
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,720
so what i like to do with acid reflux so

651
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,559
that it's not just

652
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,880
coming and going and you're trying to

653
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,440
find some things to kind of soothe it

654
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,760
i like to actually fix it so what i like

655
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,360
to do is lower fats it's something

656
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,120
that helps all on its own because you're

657
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,520
not bombarding the liver you're not

658
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,320
fatting yourself to death because that's

659
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,960
what everybody does

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,159

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,880
uh with with um with acid reflux a

749
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,400
protocol

750
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,760
all of it so it's important to do

751
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,679
it's um g colgin says it's a lot of

752
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,520
information to remember took me a long

753
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,080
time to absorb

754
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,000
yeah it's information to actually help

755
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,480
you heal when you take the time to apply

756
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,159
it then you can heal and go all the way

757
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,480
i know everybody wants a magic pill

758
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,840
don't want a magic pill yeah someone

759
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,760

doctor that's the magic pill right there

769
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,840
all i got to do is pop that pill

770
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,200
everything's fixed

771
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,200
everything goes away that's all i need

772
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,279
and that's what everybody wants that's

773
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,080
what everybody wants they don't want to

774
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,080
know

775
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,840
you know what's really going on but i

776
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,919
mean if i had the acid reflux i'd be

777
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,960
doing some goldenseal to knock out the

778
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,279
bacteria

779
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,880
i'd be doing some licorice root knock

780
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,760
out any viral stuff

781
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,240
also it soothes the linings right i'd be

782
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,760
if i

783
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,440
if i had acid reflux um i'd be doing

784
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,320
those for sure these are just a couple

785
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,400
of things i would do

786
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,440
lemon balm if i had acid reflux it's

787
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,960
another one too

788
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,039
be doing some zinc if i add acid reflux

789
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,520
that's what i would be doing right

790
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,440
and i'd be doing celery juice 16 to 32

791
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,039
ounces i'd probably be doing 32 ounces

792
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,039
of celery juice okay if i had acid

793
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,120
reflux that's what i would do

794
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,320
um definitely 32 ounces i'd be doing a

795
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,240
lemon water right

796
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,760
anyway these are the vimergy stuff right

797
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,120
you guys know the vimorji

798
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,960
because that's another thing because i'm

799
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,120
going to go into some other stuff about

800
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,880
how we get trapped on those down those

801
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,000
pitfalls too because if you don't have

802
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
the right supplements and there's

803
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,880
alcohol in them

804
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,799
with a really low grade or they got

805
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,559
fillers or they got preservatives

806
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,159
well then we're trying to climb that

807
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,679

those guys this is my the stuff that i

822
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,399
love my favorite

823
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,039
talk about diatomaceous earth

824
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,440
when i hear people are on diatomaceous

825
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,960
earth

826
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,440
right i i just feel for them

827
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,200
it it gives me like a chill down my

828
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,919
spine

829
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,880
i've heard so many stories but seeing it

830
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,440
in person

831
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,679
too sophie says i got rid of my acid

832
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,120
reflux had problems for 15 years

833
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,640
incredible that's amazing diatomaceous

834
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,720
dr fahn have you seen anything with

835
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,840
diatomaceous earth particles ever

836
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,919
i just see dr fonz there too um

837
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,240
i've witnessed it for years right i

838
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,559
remember this one case

839
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,279
where the person was just ripped the

840
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,760
shreds from it and

841
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,200
it's it's and then i know this other

842
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,640
case where

843
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,039
um this person actually blamed

844
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,799
the end of their life because of it it's

845
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,240
the most saddest story

846
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:48,240
i've ever ever ever seen i think the

847
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,240
bottom line is what i don't like about

848
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,080
diatomaceous earth is it

849
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,440
clings to the walls of the intestinal

850
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,360
lining and colon

851
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,440
and when you're inflamed it's the last

852
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,720
thing you want it causes so much agony

853
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,480
for a lot of people and if you don't

854
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,039
feel any agony and you feel fine and you

855
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,120
don't

856
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,240
you're good with it and you're taking it

857
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,480
it doesn't mean it's

858
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,559
not creating what i've always known as

859
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,360
this malabsorption where you can't

860
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,320
absorb

861
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,919
properly you can't absorb the same thing

862
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,440
charcoal does the same thing

863
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,200
in many ways right people take the

864
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,360
charcoal we'll get to that too

865
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,360
this diatomaceous earth it's always just

866
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,440
it's always been a problem

867
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,039
sherry says i just received your updated

868
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,120
medical medium book i started your

869
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,039
protocol already feeling better after a

870
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,200
week i have stage four ebv

871
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,960
i'm so excited to be on this healing

872
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,840
journey honored you're here

873
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:42,240
truly it's the best news best news ever

874
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,159
incredible yeah vanessa says i believe

875
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,080
the iron supplements i took during third

876
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,200
trimester and i developed severe

877
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,480
preeclampsia

878
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,600
i swore it was connected vanessa i'm

879
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,640
going to tell you right now something

880
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,120
that's really interesting

881
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,000
okay is that preeclampsia is low grade

882
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,080
viral

883
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,039
so yeah so if you're taking an iron

884
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,480
supplement

885
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,600
during pregnancy and you're

886
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,440
and there's a virus at hand the virus is

887
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,240
going to get really strong because when

888
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,919
you're pregnant

889
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,760
50 of your immune system when you're

890
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,600
pregnant is watching the baby

891
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,880
so that's important to know so here's

892
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,720
how it works it's like

893
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,320
50 of your um 50 of your immune system

894
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,799
is to take care of the baby

895
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,159
that's what 50 does when you're pregnant

896
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,279
is to take care of the baby your baby

897
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,880
doesn't have an immune system when

898
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,080
you're pregnant

899
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,279
so your 50 goes to the baby

900
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,559
right so now you only have 50

901
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,640
of your immune system for the rest of

902
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,279
your body instead of a hundred percent

903
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,200
so you only have 50 now right now if you

904
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,200
have any kind of low-grade viral issue

905
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,520
you can get pre-eclampsia pretty easily

906
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,520
for a lot of women so we dump a whole

907
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,600
bunch of iron in there then we feed that

908
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,279
virus right

909
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,840
dump a whole bunch of iron in there and

910
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:57,679
you feed the virus where's my virus

911
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,960
here we are and the virus will start

912
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,080
eating all the iron

913
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,080
and next thing you know what you got

914
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,039
this pre-eclampsia because the virus

915
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,279
multiplies

916
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,559
fast it proliferates when it's feeding

917
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,080
off of the iron

918
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,120
that's how it's done irma forgive me for

919
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,600

um this is not the gas pump the gasoline

1011
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,040
we're breathing in and the air

1012
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,720
fresheners and the clones and perfumes

1013
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,240
it's not the clones and perfumes know

1014
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,079
that poisonous on a daily

1015
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,359
daily basis is not the hair sprays it's

1016
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,000
not the conventional cleaners that's

1017
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,000
happenstance

1018
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,200
you know happenstance you know it's not

1019
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,560
the fact that

1020
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,400
50 of all pharmaceuticals

1021
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,119
50 of all pharmaceuticals are recalled

1022
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,160
from dangerous side effects fifty

1023
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,760
percent

1024
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,160
of all the pharmaceuticals in the world

1025
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,680
that have ever been minted and printed

1026
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,720
and produced and created fifty 50

1027
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,480
of all of them have been pulled

1028
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,760
because of side effects right no it's

1029
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,359
happenstance

1030
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,119
everything's everything's happenstance

1031
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,599
let's move on

1032
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,560
um whey protein powder it's one of my

1033
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,480
favorites it's a

1034
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,839
viral feeder viruses feed off of it you

1035
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,839
want to get sicker

1036
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,160
do some whey protein powder you want to

1037
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,440
get worse do some whey protein powder

1038
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,720
right i always say no way to weigh

1039
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,119
that's what i that's what i've always

1040
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,359
said all these years is like say no way

1041
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,280
to weigh and that's it whey protein

1042
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,560
powder plus they'll throw they'll throw

1043
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,400
all kinds of stuff in whey protein

1044
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,599
powder and boot it up and make it worse

1045
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,480
natural flavors

1046
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,760
which is msg whey protein powders always

1047
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,000
have natural flavors in there if you

1048
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,040
find

1049
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,160
one that doesn't have a natural

1050
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,800
flavoring it's still bad news

1051
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,320
yeah david happenstance that's what it

1052
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,760
is it's all happenstance

1053
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,560
so let's move on to another one whey

1054
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,680
protein powder is really really

1055
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,480
ear an irritant for people makes mucus

1056
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,599
form from feeding bacteria so whey

1057
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,920
protein powder

1058
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,520
feeds bacteria really easily that's

1059
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,520
another thing too you want to grow all

1060
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,200
that bad bacteria to keep on doing the

1061
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,920
whey protein powder right

1062
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,720
so we got that covered we got a lot of

1063
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,599
different things

1064
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,079
let's go into multivitamins junk junk

1065
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,359
junk

1066
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,079
junk junk multivitamins

1067
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,720
are the junk keep that in mind that's

1068
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,560
the multivitamins cheap

1069
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,440
low-grade vitamins sitting in vitamin

1070
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,480
storage

1071
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,880
bins massive lots of vitamin

1072
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:56,320
warehouses filled with vitamin

1073
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,760
powders the bad ones garbage

1074
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,119
bulk low grade sitting there sometimes

1075
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,320
for 10 years

1076
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,119
and you know what they don't put in the

1077
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,280
the expiration date doesn't start when

1078
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,359
they get the bulk stuff

1079
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,680
the bulk stuff that sits in these

1080
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:17,680
massive massive warehouses where

1081
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:20,560
the bad cheap vitamins get their stuff

1082
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,119
the expiration date starts when it gets

1083
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,079
into your

1084
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,480
bottle that's when it starts it doesn't

1085
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,320
start

1086
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,119
it could sit for 10 years

1087
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,520
and then you get this moldy vitamin that

1088
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,800
has

1089
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,160
a little bit of everything a little bit

1090
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,520
of calcium a little bit of this a little

1091
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,480
bit of that a little bit of selenium a

1092
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,079
little bit blah blah blah

1093
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,280
a little bit of some enzymes bubble all

1094
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,960
this other stuff all the way down a

1095
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,160
little vitamin a blah blah blah blah

1096
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:47,680
right your multivitamin the bees

1097
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,680
and all that that stuff is so old

1098
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,079
even though the date looks great hey

1099
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,960
this expires 2022.

1100
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,560
this one's fresh dude it's 10 years old

1101
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,200
already

1102
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,800
so low grade bulk garbage

1103
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,000
multivitamins where they rip you off a

1104
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,920
little speck of everything

1105
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,599
in there it's not even done right that's

1106
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,040
just one reason why it's not good

1107
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,800
multivitamins will have

1108
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,240
a lot of fillers in there a lot of

1109
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,839
garbage in there but the big

1110
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,720
reason why i also don't like the

1111
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,839
multivitamins is because

1112
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,119
it's it's the one the big reasons is

1113
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,480
this stuff

1114
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,400
is like ancient it's not produced and

1115
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,560
then goes out the door

1116
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,760
right manufacturing doesn't work like

1117
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,040
that for the low

1118
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,560
grade multi vitamin stuff for

1119
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,079
for all that stuff so that's one thing

1120
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,960
right there it's really important to go

1121
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,400
to another one

1122
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,400

they put a little bit of all these

1149
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,520
things in there

1150
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,920
that could never move the needle and you

1151
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,000
buy it and you spend good money on it

1152
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,440
and then there's fillers in there too

1153
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
that's a whole nother thing all on its

1154
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,760
own so

1155
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,200
that that i mean just giving you a quick

1156
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,839
rundown of why i don't even like that

1157
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,760
stuff

1158
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,359
um and it's not even for hair skin and

1159
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,839
nails you want you want

1160
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,040
your skin better you got to do some

1161
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,000
stuff for it

1162
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,440
you know you've got to do something for

1163
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,079
it if you're getting hair loss as a

1164
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,320
woman

1165
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,079
that's adrenals that have to be

1166
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,160
addressed hair skin nail supplements

1167
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,920
don't address the adrenals

1168
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,760
so it's not even addressing why a

1169
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,839
woman's losing her hair like

1170
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,599
hair skin hair skin nail supplements

1171
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,440
aren't addressing adrenals

1172
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,359
they're not since that's important all

1173
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,040
on its own um

1174
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,800
and then let's keep on going a little

1175
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,839
bit more with this right

1176
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,960
so when it comes down to

1177
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,760
hair skin nail supplements okay keep in

1178
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,280
mind that this is how it works right

1179
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,560
what's in there is a man-made

1180
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,520
concoction of what

1181
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,000
someone thinks you will need to get your

1182
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,280
skin

1183
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,160
better your nails better right

1184
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,880
and that's a mistake all on its own in

1185
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,119
order to get

1186
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,440
nails better you have to fix the liver

1187
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,000
but a hair skin nail supplement

1188
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,680
isn't going to fix your liver it's not

1189
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,880
there to repair your

1190
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,880
liver keep that in mind right so

1191
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,560
already we're off the mark like boom

1192
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,560
down the drain we're already going down

1193
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,280
the drain we already have a problem

1194
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,000
in order for hair skin nail supplement

1195
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,640
to be a hair

1196
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
skin nail supplement it has has to be

1197
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,160
fixing your liver

1198
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,800
and it's not fixing your liver in order

1199
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,440
to get your nails to way you want them

1200
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,319
you've got to fix your liver that's your

1201
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,520
vitamin

1202
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,960
mineral producer in a way

1203
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,960
or storage bin right that's what's

1204
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,400
storing all your vitamins and then

1205
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,560
converting them

1206
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,920
if your liver stagnant and sluggish and

1207
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,680
having problems

1208
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,319
you're not going to be fixing that liver

1209
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,200
with a jamokey

1210
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:41,359
gimmicky hair skin hair skin nail

1211
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,680
supplement it's not going to happen

1212
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,560
um it has to be something that's geared

1213
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,560
towards fixing a stagnant sluggish liver

1214
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,480
that's what it needs like that's what

1215
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,240
you need and that's a problem all on its

1216
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,520
own so that's a big one looking for my

1217
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,839
liver right now

1218
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:00,960
um and so keep that in mind really

1219
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,960
so that's something there

1220
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,359
so the bottom line is that's when it

1221
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,200
comes down to nails so when it comes

1222
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,480

right so you know all this information

1335
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,960
is really it's precious information

1336
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,280
i had a doctor tell me that the other

1337
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,160
day beth says what about fish oil let's

1338
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,520
go

1339
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,599
this oil said there right

1340
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,680
fish oil is a bad one i actually have a

1341
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,839
fish oil bottle somewhere around here

1342
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:32,640
but before this for this as a prop

1343
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,960
fish oil is one of those things where we

1344
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,720
get

1345
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,960
sold a bill of goods with that one like

1346
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,520
we need that omega in the fish oil like

1347
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,960
we need

1348
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,079
fish oil right we're sold we're

1349
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,960
brainwashed into fish oil

1350
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,680
okay and the irony is is we don't need

1351
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,920
fish oil

1352
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,119
so what they do is they take all these

1353
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,760
body parts

1354
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,800
fish body parts that aren't being used

1355
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,599
okay so they take

1356
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,720
fish and they flay the fish they take

1357
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,400
the fillet

1358
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,160
and they put that in the restaurants

1359
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,440
right they take the filet they put that

1360
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,119
in the grocery stores

1361
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,040
they take to the filet they put that in

1362
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,880
the seafood market right

1363
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,079
they take that filet and they make it

1364
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,680
into fish sticks frozen fish right

1365
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,680
and then they take the heads the tails

1366
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,079
the fins some of the guts

1367
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,839
they take all that and the skin and

1368
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,720
everything else and all this gnarly

1369
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,400
stuff

1370
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,640
and they take that and they send that to

1371
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,319
the fish oil companies right

1372
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,960
fish oil companies got a billion fish

1373
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,920
different kinds of fish all mixed up

1374
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,520
different fish

1375
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,640
parts all messed up mitch mashed right

1376
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,640
and then they press it press it press it

1377
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,319
to get all that fish oil out of it

1378
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,000
okay which is actually the whole thing's

1379
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,640
just sick right

1380
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,319
then that fish oil has got more mercury

1381
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,680
in it than if you were to eat a piece of

1382
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,760
fish

1383
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,839
so that fish oil's got more mercury in

1384
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,040
it than if you were gonna ever eat a

1385
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,960
piece of fish

1386
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,079
that's what's really interesting about

1387
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,119
it okay so

1388
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,960
it's got more mercury and if you were

1389
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:05,680
ever to eat the salmon right here

1390
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:09,440
okay so that salmon's got mercury in it

1391
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,839
but that salmon has way less mercury in

1392
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,359
it

1393
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,680
than if you were going to have a fish

1394
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,880
oil supplement now fish oil company be

1395
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,680
like no no no we remove our mercury

1396
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,559
nope we get ours tested we remove the

1397
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,880
mercury

1398
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,559
when they do that mercury removal right

1399
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,720
that centrifuge

1400
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,040
and they do that mercury removal they're

1401
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,880
creating a homeopathic

1402
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:37,040
nightmare a homeopathic nightmare

1403
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,280
when you remove mercury out of fish oil

1404
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,960
you leave the essence of that mercury

1405
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,040
behind

1406
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,480
now we made it hundreds of times

1407
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,440
stronger we turned it into a

1408
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,599
methyl mercury a mercury that can travel

1409
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,400
deeper into the brain

1410
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,240
so fish oil supplements take you to also

1411
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,920
you want alzheimer's

1412
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,119
do you guys want dementia you want to

1413
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,119
you don't want to know where your car

1414
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,480
keys are ever ever

1415
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,680
you don't want to know where your phone

1416
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,559
you don't want to remember your phone

1417
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,760

1418
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,000
you don't want to remember your best

1419
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,880
friend's phone number um

1420
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
you want severe debilitating anxiety

1421
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,559
depression

1422
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,240
uh keep on doing fish oil because it'll

1423
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,480
take you there faster

1424
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,000
that's the brain killer it's one of the

1425
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,960
brain killers

1426
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,400
and um so the fish oil thing is the real

1427
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,920
scary thing for me

1428
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,680
for a lot of people and i'm worried

1429
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,520
about a lot of people that are on it

1430
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,280
because it's like dude it's time to

1431
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,559
reverse whatever damage that has

1432
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,319
occurred all these years you've been on

1433
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,680
fish oil all these years it's time to do

1434
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:39,040
something about it right

1435
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,040
so i'm going to put the salmon away

1436
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,359
we're live right now if you guys didn't

1437
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,599
know

1438
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,640
uh cassandra risley my ferritin is

1439
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,559
extremely low

1440
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,319
how do i how do i get it to increase

1441
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,599
without an iron supplement if they're

1442
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,280
bad for you

1443
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,200
if you have to go with an iron

1444
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,839
supplement go with a plant-based iron

1445
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,359
supplement

1446
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,040
i mean that's what i would do do what

1447
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,240
your doctor tells you because android

1448
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,000
your doctor tells you your doctor tells

1449
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,559
you to do this or that or take iron or

1450
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
whatever it is

1451
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,920
you listen to your doctor but i'm just

1452
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,400
saying that if it was me

1453
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,319
and i had low iron what i would do is i

1454
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,119
would get it from foods

1455
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:14,000
if you or if if my doctor was telling me

1456
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,599
hey

1457
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,040
you should do you know iron here's the

1458
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,559
iron and be like well let me go find a

1459
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,480
good plant-based iron and then ask your

1460
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,839
doctor's permission right

1461
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,839
um that's something right there but

1462
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,760
foods is like where i like to get iron

1463
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,040
from my wild blueberries i like to get

1464
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,079
iron from

1465
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,920
um from barley grass juice powder it's

1466
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,559
another thing too so i love to get iron

1467
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,119
from that

1468
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:38,079
love to get iron from spirulina because

1469
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,920
even small amounts of iron right this is

1470
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,040
barley grassy's powder right here even

1471
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,559
small amounts of

1472
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:47,839
iron okay um

1473
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:50,240
small amounts of iron right can be more

1474
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,920
assimilatable could be more absorbable

1475
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,559
could be more

1476
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,640
you can have more conversion process

1477
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:59,839
with that with your body and your liver

1478
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:02,480
because you can take gobs of iron

1479
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,440
and your body just not do anything with

1480
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,920
it right

1481
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,520
so then when the doctor draws your blood

1482
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,160
like well yeah your iron's up

1483
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,800
doesn't mean it's working but your irons

1484
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
up right

1485
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,559
so they draw the blood that's what

1486
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,200
happens there um i like knowing i'm

1487
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,200

1488
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,480

i've seen bad batches of krell for some

1547
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,520
reason that has slipped

1548
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,280
through the gates over the years you

1549
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,480

a fan of it

1551
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,920
ten different reasons i'm just giving

1552
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,640
you two right there it doesn't remove

1553
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,559
metals out and if it does it drops them

1554
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,079
um talk about caffeine a little bit

1555
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,440
caffeine you guys know how much i've

1556
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,119
been talking about caffeine medical

1557
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,640
being podcasted apple podcasts i talk

1558
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,480
about caffeine right

1559
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,720
caffeine's a whole nother level right

1560
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,720
there of of problems you got the coffee

1561
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,640
drinks you got the energy drinks

1562
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,240
you got the coffee you got the chocolate

1563
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,880
right so you got the matcha tea you got

1564
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,359
the teas

1565
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,559
right you got the green teas caffeine

1566
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,599
that's the ager

1567
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,599
of our time right if women want to age

1568
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,119
and they want those wrinkles fast and

1569
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,000
they want those wrinkles in their early

1570
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,880
30s and late

1571
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,040
20s they want they want their skin to

1572
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,240
sag they want the malaysia they want the

1573
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,000
spots if if women want all that stuff

1574
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,680
then drink lots of caffeine

1575
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,839
drink your coffee drinks drink your your

1576
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,920
green tea drink your matcha tea

1577
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:08,000
just give you the rundown it's the ager

1578
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,119
it's the women ager

1579
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,119
and man ager two but it's the ager

1580
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,640
especially women because women have

1581
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,319
their adrenals are under different

1582
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,800
demands their adrenals go through

1583
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,960
different

1584
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,559
different things than men's adrenals do

1585
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,599
women's adrenals are always in more

1586
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,200
fight or flight

1587
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,119
and then when you add the caffeine you

1588
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,640
put them in super fight or flight

1589
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,400
then you burn out the hormones in the

1590
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,280
adrenals hormone producers that's

1591
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,240
another thing too

1592
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,280
but the caffeine burns out the liver it

1593
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,520
eats up

1594
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,520
it eats up the bones women get

1595
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,160
osteopenia from it they get teeth

1596
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,280
problems

1597
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,680
caffeine will be that's the literally

1598
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,200

1661
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,960

yeah chad it's it

1665
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,119
young women don't know this right

1666
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,079
they're all about making sure their

1667
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,319

1668
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,359
white like taking care of their teeth

1669
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,200

1670
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,520
right and they're doing the apple cider

00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,920
vinegar every single day

1672
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,319
and it's like it scares me because i

1673
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,720
want what people want if

1674
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:14,160

1675
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,040
i want your teeth to be whatever you

00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,559
want them to be right if you want to be

1677
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,960
whatever you want to be i want to

1678
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,960
support that right but then i just watch

1679
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,880
this disaster happening it doesn't have

1680
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,000
to touch the teeth like i said already

1681
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:31,040
but it's it's i've watched this disaster

1682
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,160
happen the apple cider vinegar nightmare

1683
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,440
in the 20-something year olds and then i

1684
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,359
know that it's like

1685
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,680
it's hard when you know this stuff right

1686
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:41,200
it's hard you guys when you know

1687
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,280
and you're like okay you just did three

1688
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,839
years apple cider vinegar gummies and

1689
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,599
shots

1690
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,280
and you're 25 years old it's like okay

1691
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,599
when you're 35 you're gonna be in the

1692
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,280
dentist chair every single day

1693
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,440
and there's nothing you can say you know

1694
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,359
it's like see we hear i see that topical

1695
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,520
charcoal

1696
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:59,839
topical charcoal is is fine if you want

1697
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,960
to use charcoal topically for something

1698
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:06,319
yeah i mean if you want uh so

1699
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:09,599
but but internally like diges

1700
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:11,440
ingesting it right but the people i see

1701
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,200
with the teeth problems that come years

1702
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,119
later it's like yeah you've been doing

1703
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,880
the vinegars i don't know what to say

1704
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,119
you've been doing it what am i gonna do

1705
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,480
i can't stop you from doing it i can't

1706
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:26,960
i can't stop you i don't know what to do

1707
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:30,799
right but the charcoal suffocates

1708
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:34,079
absorption so it's

1709
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:37,440
so fine and it doesn't

1710
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:40,559
come out of your

1711
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:44,079
layer that layer that's on the

1712
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:47,599
inside the gut this layer right

1713
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:51,040
it suffocates and destroys

1714
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:54,799
like your cell

1715
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,000
um basically that that transfusion that

1716
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:59,520
occurs right

1717
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,400
with cells the absorption process

1718
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,880
and as a cell in your intestinal lining

1719
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,319
is

1720
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:10,079
is awaiting to absorb anything

1721
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:11,760
the charcoal is so fine it clogs up the

1722
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:15,280
cell it doesn't cleanse the cell

1723
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,839
it clogs it up it suffocates so when you

1724
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,520
when you do the internal charcoal and

1725
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:21,599
you're taking the supplements

1726
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,599
you coat your entire intestinal tract

1727
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,799
going all the way down to your colon

1728
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:29,040
with charcoal and it adheres it just

1729
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:30,480
cleans just like diatomaceous earth

1730
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,119
particles clings

1731
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,160
to the walls and it doesn't let

1732
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,119
nutrients

1733
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,520
go in it doesn't let the absorption

1734
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,599
absorption for you get malabsorption

1735
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,920
you're going to be pooping out all of

1736
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:46,480
your nutrients and not bringing them

1737
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,319
in it's a nightmare let's head to

1738
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,640
another one

1739
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:50,640
um

1740
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:59,680

chocolate is

1744
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,880
healing and do all the ceremonies and

1745
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:10,000
it's so hard to witness

1746
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,520
um you know the problem is

1747
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,760
it could be because they're they're

1748
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,559
they're slaves to the caffeine industry

1749
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,400
you know

1750
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:22,240
it's the caffeine industry knows if you

1751
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:25,680
can if you can invade the healing

1752
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:28,079
sacred area of wellness right

1753
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,839
the caffeine industry knows if you can

1754
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,160
hit the yoga mamas

1755
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:34,160
if you can hit the yoga community if you

1756
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,599
can hit the spiritual community

1757
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:40,799
if you can saturate these communities

1758
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:42,000
into the sacred belief community right

1759
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:44,160
of sacred

1760
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,160

1761
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,720
self-care sacred medicine sacred

1762
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,319
everything

1763
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,119
the caffeine industry knows that if you

1764
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:54,400
can you can get in there

1765
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,079
they're golden they just have to get in

1766
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,640
there and they have they've gotten in

1767
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,880
there right

1768
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,480

and what happens is

1772
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:11,280
it's basically an enslavement for women

1773
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,079
and it's just to basically keep them on

1774
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,119
caffeine

1775
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,400

you know it's not a good idea why is it

1825
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,280
not a good idea

1826
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,720
because you know it's you know it's not

1827
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,960
a good idea

1828
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,839
i gotcha so are you supposed to be on

1829
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,240
chocolate every single day

1830
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:18,559
and just be on highs and lows what

1831
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:23,200
happened you crashed really bad

1832
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:24,319
it's awful and then you are feeling good

1833
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,640
you feel like you don't even know who

1834
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:29,119
you are now like depersonalization

1835
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,720
maybe you just need a chocolate hit like

1836
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,960
another cacao hit

1837
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,319
and you can kind of find yourself and

1838
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,760
normalize

1839
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,599
but what happens when it starts wearing

1840
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,280
off then you're into this like weird

1841
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,039
depression again

1842
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,559
all right i'll talk about after the show

1843
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,200
we're live right now

1844
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,799
no i know i told you to call in i'm

1845
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,200
sorry about that but we got to cover the

1846
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,559
rest

1847
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,559
i got to talk about a little bit more

1848
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,559
the problem is with cacao is is that it

1849
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,440
blows your adrenals out so you age fast

1850
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:02,000
and so really what's happening is it's

1851
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,119
teaching women just to get their babies

1852
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,680
also on cacao

1853
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,440
everybody on cacao and can continue that

1854
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,599
life cycle of cacao right

1855
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,440
of the caffeine industry so that the

1856
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,200
shareholders can sit back

1857
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,960
and they know that the addiction itself

1858
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,280
takes care of it and no matter what

1859
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,480
you can be in financial ruin but you'll

1860
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,599
buy that chocolate

1861
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,960
you can be like no job and still buy

1862
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,760
that chocolate inflation

1863
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,880
can go through the roof and literally

1864
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,039
there's there's like

1865
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,559
people just can't afford anything and

1866
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,480
they'll just be buying the chocolate it

1867
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,440
reminds me of a friend of mine right

1868
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,559
who had no money no money but made sure

1869
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,880
like no money

1870
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,240
to actually even like feed their family

1871
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,720
right but yet

1872
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,400
they made enough meaning they made room

1873
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,720
for cigarettes

1874
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,520
right they made room for cigarettes they

1875
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,240
always had

1876
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,799
they bought two packs a day right but

1877
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,960
yet

1878
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:54,799
their kids like there's like their kids

1879
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,280
it was like no we can't afford that

1880
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,960

1881
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,960

1882
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,720
those strawberries they're too much per

1883
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,559
pint but it was still

1884
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,880

1885
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,640
