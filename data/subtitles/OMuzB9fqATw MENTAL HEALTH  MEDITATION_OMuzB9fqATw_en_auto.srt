1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,880
you hear people talk about meditation

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,279
all the time that's what they'll talk

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,480
about i meditate i'm doing my meditation

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,120
in the morning

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,360
i'm doing my meditation

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,440
why is everybody meditating because

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,119
their brains are messed up

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,039
their brains are messed up

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,039
that's why they're meditating their

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,960
brains weren't so messed up

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,320
they wouldn't be meditating

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,439
no one would be sitting there for an

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
hour

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,359
trying to meditate when they got a lot

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,039
of things to do people be really busy

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
and everything but their brains are

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,640
messed up depression anxiety

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,360
depersonalization

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,280
right and that that's just three words

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,280
that cover

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
thousands and thousands of endless

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,320
different symptoms in it right there

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,520
just so you know depersonalization you

24
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,760
could have feelings of sadness

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
loneliness loss of hope not knowing

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,879
where you are not worrying not knowing

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,960
where you should be wanting to be

28
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,320
someplace else right whatever it is

29
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,000
feeling disconnected not feeling

30
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,840
connected feeling disconnected from

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
loved ones feeling like you can't see

32
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,719
feeling like you can't hear like

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,800
depersonalization is unbelievable like

34
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,479
the vast amount of

35
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,280
symptoms right

36
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,799
but

37
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,360
people have to understand the reason why

38
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,960
we meditate and everybody meditates is

39
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,720
because they either

40
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,240
have something that they're not settled

41
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,759
with they're not happy with they're

42
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,360
looking for happiness they're looking to

43
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
elevate their happiness they're looking

44
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,200
to elevate their well-being they're

45
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
looking to spiritually achieve they're

46
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,119
looking to kind of rise out of whatever

47
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,040
it is they're stuck in whatever it is we

48
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,119
meditate because

49
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,880
something's messed up

50
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,400
something's messed up

51
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
it's not like everything's perfect

52
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,400
everything's incredible like you

53
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
everything nothing is wrong with

54
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,040
anything anyhow anywhere i'm just gonna

55
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,119
go meditate

56
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
right it doesn't really work like that

57
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,880
we start searching for meditations we

58
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,720
start searching for reasons to meditate

59
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
and reasons to actually achieve that

60
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,960
kind of extra help with our brain and

61
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,439
consciousness and mind spiritual mind

62
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,280
body however we want to look at it

63
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,759

smoothie we're talking about meditation

289
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,600
we're talking about

290
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,959
how everybody's brains are just getting

291
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,040
beefed up

292
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,000
really bad out there you see it every

293
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,440
day

294
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,120
and a lot of people are just losing

295
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
their minds

296
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
it's not has nothing to do with

297
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,680
it has nothing to do with people being

298
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,640
crazy or not that's not it

299
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,880
so we have to kind of be able to

300
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,480
separate that understand that it's not

301
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
about being crazy

302
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,519

just you don't know what you're

308
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,240
suffering with and understand you don't

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,200
meditation for a couple of seconds too

376
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
what are you using when you're doing

377
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,000
meditation what are you trying to

378
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,639
connect what are you using

379
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,079
trying to use your third eye right

380
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,240
trying to use

381
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,680
that direct passageway into the soul

382
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,839
you're trying to use the subconscious

383
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,079
consciousness right into the soul

384
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,600
right when you're meditating and we're

385
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,519
trying to use our physical brain to kind

386
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,279
of connect that that's what we're doing

387
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,320
right

388
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,440
we're trying to get spiritually

389
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,040
connected

390
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,399
we're trying to get grounded right when

391
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,240
we're meditating so we're actually

392
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,399
trying to get grounded

393
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
okay

394
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,800
right

395
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,240
we're trying to connect to above too

396
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,839
when we do meditations or are we trying

397
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,519
to connect to a bubble that's that's

398
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,440
something right there meditations don't

399
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
mean you're just sitting there like

400
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,040
doing ohms and you're just sitting there

401
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,000
that doesn't mean that you can be

402
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,200
sitting on your back porch

403
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,839
looking at a bird fly by

404
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
and

405
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,800
contemplating that's a meditation right

406
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,240
there

407
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,079

wealthy people around you that are in

417
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,720
some resort somewhere up on some

418
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,720
mountain in aspen

419
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,760

class you can be anywhere you can be

421
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,320
anywhere you can be literally

422
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,600
in your room you wake up one morning and

423
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,639
you're still laying in your bed and you

424
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
can meditate right there

425
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,440
you can lay in your bed in your bedroom

426
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,279
right when you wake up in the morning

427
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,639
and right when you wake up

428
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,639
what you do

429
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,120
is just start thinking about what clouds

430
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,199
look like

431
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
and what the sky looks like and you

432
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,720
think about the bluest sky you've ever

433
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
seen

434
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,079
and you close your eyes and you envision

435
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,519
you're looking at that blue sky right

436
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,160
when you wake up that's a powerful

437
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,160
meditation

438
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
you don't have to be about around a

439
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,000
bunch of sweaty people

440
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,920
in some resort somewhere or you don't

441
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,680
have to be around somewhere else or

442
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,920
whatever

443
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,720
people don't have to be sweaty or not

444
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,800
depends if they just did yoga

445
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,560
but the point is is you don't have to do

446
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,240
that

447
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,399
there's a lot of ways to do powerful

448
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,639
small meditations that are really true

449
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,079
powerful meditations

450
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
and you can do them real quick and easy

451
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,639
you can be sitting literally in a chair

452
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,519
outside in nature and you can see a bird

453
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,199
fly by you can see a pigeon land

454
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,120
if you're in the city and you can get a

455
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,519
meditation right off of looking at a

456
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
pigeon

457
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,160
but what are you trying to do

458
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,519
trying to alleviate something you're

459
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,800
trying to heal something you're trying

460
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,480
to achieve something you're trying to

461
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,560
bridge a gap

462
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
too right

463
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,839
hannah t says this is an incredible live

464
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,120
i'm honored

465
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,440
it's an incredible life because you're

466
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,440
here

467
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,240
so when it comes down to meditation

468
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,680
meditation is hard for a lot of people

469
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,959
who have been through hell and back too

470
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,160
they've been there and done that they

471
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,079
tried different meditations

472
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,360
right they've done different things and

473
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,120
it just didn't feel like they got

474
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,519
anywhere with it too a lot of people

475
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
have a lot of panic and anxiety so

476
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,480
trying to meditate it's really difficult

477
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
for them if they got tightness to the

478
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,360
chest and they're trying to breathe and

479
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,800
meditate it's hard for a lot of people

480
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,079
have neurological problems and no one

481
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,199
realizes that they just think they're

482
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,079
wimps

483
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,079
they're not wimps

484
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,240
meditation is difficult when you're

485
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,079
suffering from bipolar or depression or

486
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
anxiety or depersonalization or

487
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,279
schizophrenia or whatever you're

488
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
suffering from mentally and emotionally

489
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,839
or just emotional injuries and ptsd if

490
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,079
you're suffering from ptsd meditation is

491
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,199
hell i know so many people who have ptsd

492
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,120
and had ptsd and meditation was just

493
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,560
total health for them

494
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,920
because as they're trying to meditate

495
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,920
all they see is the hell they've been

496
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,600
through

497
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,839

499
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,279
or think about anything that's why

500
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,240
sitting

501
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,399

is critical for meditating that's

505
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,720
critical watching a bee hum around and

506
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,160

507
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,680

they don't have to be

518
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,199
this grandiose process

519
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,000

751
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,200
haven't been through it themselves they

752
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
don't understand

753
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,039

the ages

858
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,600
how many bigfoots were feasting off of

859
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,520

860
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,000

these wild blueberries

863
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,600
and then they would go and disappear in

864
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,120
the woods and then indigenous culture

865
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,960
native americans other indigenous

866
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,720
cultures would come in and feed off of

867
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
those wild blueberries they would come

868
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,880
and go and then the beer bears would

869
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,559
come in and the grizzlies and the black

870
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,799
bear would come in they'd feed off of

871
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,640
them bears love that and they would feed

872
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,960
off them and they would go

873
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,799
walk away the alien crash would come and

874
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,399
land and the aliens come out of the

875
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,320
alien crafts in the middle of the night

876
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,679
or the day and they would feed off those

877
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,399
wild blueberries and go back in the

878
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,399
craft and take off

879
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,760
these plants have seen a lot you guys

880
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,600
they've seen a lot

881
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,039
and so that's important to know right

882
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,880
there

883
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,720
and it's more than just that they have

884
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,120
survived

885
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,000
they have adapted

886
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,360
this is a wild food

887
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,200
this is a food that takes care of itself

888
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,760
when it takes care of itself it holds

889
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,919
something holds something powerful and

890
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,440
this stuff is high in manganese by the

891
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,080
way

892
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,200
extremely high in manganese making these

893
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,440
is that

894
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,600
that bridge builder trace mineral

895
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,519
and it's high in this juice right it's

896
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,600
high in the wild blueberry so

897
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,679
people wonder like how do these

898
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,600
antioxidants work well that manganese is

899
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,919
part of how these antioxidants work and

900
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,240
bridge that gap

901
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,840
but the anthocyanins that blue color

902
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,519
have to go somewhere so when you eat

903
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,120
these wild blueberries you drink the

904
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,640
juice you're getting straight i always

905
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,279
say this is mainlining it right here

906
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,880
this is direct fast into the bloodstream

907
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,799
right so

908
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,360
when it's the juice it's like right into

909
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,519
the bloodstream fast right through the

910
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,120
stomach walls right through the duodenum

911
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,399
walls right through the intestinal tract

912
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,840
and that's just going through you quick

913
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,320
and then it gets into your bloodstream

914
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,760
in that blue that blue color finds its

915
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,799
way to where

916
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,960
to the meditation center it finds its

917
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,880
way to the meditation center that blue

918
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,480
color finds its way to where the

919
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,880
meditation

920
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,960
is happening

921
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,559
you can meditate

922
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,760
fast

923
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,000
anytime you want you can stop

924
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,600
and you can see a squirrel

925
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,919
and then you can just

926
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,720
instantly believe

927
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,600
i am that squirrel now

928
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,200
and transport yourself through

929
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,760
your thought process using your

930
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,640
consciousness that you are that squirrel

931
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,960
chewing on that nut on the tree that's a

932
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,960
meditation in that moment real fast

933
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,399
that quick

934
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,840
you can shut your eyes and you can

935
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,720
listen to the wind blow

936
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,880
that's a meditation

937
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,799
you can also go into a meditation center

938
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,640
and mess around and play around with

939
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,399
singing bowls and

940
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,159
sit there and

941
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,320
you do whatever you want but the point

942
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,720
is what can help

943
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,880
in the meditation centers what i've

944
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,519
always heard from spirit of compassion

945
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,960
is the blue color

946
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,440
and i've been talking about this for

947
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,960
over 30 years probably 40 years

948
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,960
trying not to date me too much

949
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,880
but i've been around for a while already

950
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,679
on this planet

951
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,360
i hope to be around longer

952
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,039
by the way if something happens to me

953
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,159
guys

954
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,000
all right

955
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,240
just saying

956
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,840
something happens to me you know

957
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,960
all right

958
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,360
yeah

959
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,960
anyway

960
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,000
i'm just telling you i didn't kill

961
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,480
myself or anything like that just

962
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
letting you know

963
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,399
or anything else

964
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,399
something happens it wasn't an accident

965
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,600
okay

966
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,600
something happens to me and

967
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,039
we lose me and they say it was an

968
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,039
accident it wasn't an accident

969
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:04,000
anyway out of there for a second

970
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,440
the bottom line is it's what i'm trying

971
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,640
to tell you

972
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,040
okay

973
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,359
is that that blue anthocyanin i've been

974
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,599
talking about for well over three

975
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,520
decades spirit of compassion has always

976
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:20,119
told me it goes and it gets to the brain

977
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,119
and it goes into a place

978
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,760
in the emotional centers of the brain it

979
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,639
goes into a place where the third eye is

980
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,079
it goes into the place

981
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,919
that harbors that energy source

982
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,119
that supernatural force that we have

983
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,839
inside our brains because we're not just

984
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,879
physical brain matter and gray matter or

985
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,359
supernatural force and soul so we're all

986
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,440
that so that blue goes into that

987
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,440
supernatural force and it goes into

988
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,440
there into that area in the brain

989
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,119
and it connects to the consciousness and

990
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,760
subconsciousness to the soul into the

991
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,599
supernatural force and that energy field

992
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,000
and that electricity that's in our brain

993
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,599
and around our brain that anthocyanin

994
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,720
connects to that that's what spirit of

995
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,920
compassion told me when i was a kid

996
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,920
it connects to that

997
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,720
and that's power

998
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,480
from food

999
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,480
i have heard over and over again people

1000
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,000
are like yeah i know food you could use

1001
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,119
food as medicine yeah but what kind of

1002
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,119
food are you talking about

1003
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,119
you talking about wild food because if

1004
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,160
you're not talking about wild food and

1005
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,520
you're not talking about wild

1006
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,520
blueberries and you're not talking about

1007
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,160
wild food then i don't know what you're

1008
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,400
talking about

1009
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,920
it's a big difference

1010
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,520
every time i talk about the wild

1011
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,280
blueberries someone goes out and buys a

1012
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,800
clam shell with the big cultivated

1013
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,079
blueberries in it it's like he told me

1014
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,839
blueberries are good for me and they

1015
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,079
dump them in there and i feel bad

1016
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,839
because i get it because we've also

1017
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,839
we've also been brainwashed about our

1018
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,920
food and our

1019
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,160
food sources out there and we're we're

1020
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,839
just not taught we just don't know we

1021
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,920
don't know there's a difference between

1022
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,760
wild and then everybody and then the

1023
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,920
organic police come in and start

1024
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,839
freaking out and say well why isn't

1025
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,359
wyman's organic and they don't even

1026
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,000
realize

1027
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,520
that wild is above organic and they

1028
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,839
don't even know wilde doesn't love

1029
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,720
organic they don't know that and that's

1030
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,520
a whole sad thing all on its own

1031
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,040
i talked about that the other day

1032
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,359
people think

1033
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,440
organic is holy

1034
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,839
holy

1035
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,160
can't do no wrong

1036
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,920
you know like holy and

1037
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,000
godly

1038
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,839
they don't realize yeah we have to eat

1039
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,079
organic food heck yeah but they don't

1040
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,000
realize that organic foods loaded with

1041
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,560
copper spray and

1042
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,480
nicotine spray to kill the pollinators

1043
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,480
and kill the they don't know what kills

1044
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,839
the pollinators it kills the pollinators

1045
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,680
and

1046
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,960
organic is it all crapped up to be

1047
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,400
right

1048
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,720
wild food

1049
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,640
right doesn't need to be cared for so

1050
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,400
what happens is that you barely spray

1051
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,200
ever you can go years without spraying a

1052
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,280
wild food source meanwhile organic farms

1053
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,560
are actually they're organic farms are

1054
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,359
conventional farms did you guys know

1055
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,680
that

1056
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,720
organic farms came after conventional

1057
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,440
produce conventional farms organic farm

1058
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,760
owners companies organic farm companies

1059
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,440
bought conventional farmland and started

1060
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,640
planting the stuff the soil saturated

1061
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,320
with pesticides and chemicals

1062
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,160
and so people don't realize they're

1063
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,480
growing all their organic food out of

1064
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,960
pesticide-ridden soil

1065
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,440
meanwhile a wild food gets sprayed so

1066
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,960
very little and the soil was never

1067
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,000
sprayed to begin with from a

1068
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,400
conventional farm so it's pure soil down

1069
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,839
there they don't get this beverly says

1070
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,960
what are we going to do with all of

1071
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,960
these shortages going on

1072
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,720
that's the whole point like i'm talking

1073
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,720
about a wild food

1074
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,880
look i got my freezer stocked with some

1075
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,640
wild blueberries

1076
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,240
that's one thing i got and i'm stocked

1077
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,359

there

1079
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,000
