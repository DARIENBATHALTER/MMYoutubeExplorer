[75.76 - 78.40] i'm doing so
[77.04 - 79.68] i want you to know about the eggs and

[82.88 - 85.12] to eczema and all kinds of different
[84.24 - 87.92] conditions
[85.12 - 89.36] and staying away from eggs is critical
[87.92 - 91.52] it's critical so that's why i'm here
[89.36 - 94.24] talking about this topic today alone
[91.52 - 95.76] but in this in it actually really soon
[94.24 - 96.96] i'm going to have guests come on people
[95.76 - 98.64] that heal from medical medium
[96.96 - 99.28] information i'm going to have doctors

[99.28 - 102.48] can have dentists come on special
[101.36 - 105.12] friends special guests
[102.48 - 106.96] scientists lab technicians people i know
[105.12 - 109.20] people have known for years that are
[106.96 - 111.44] actually fighting the battle out there
[109.20 - 113.28] helping people heal from chronic illness
[111.44 - 114.08] spreading the medical medium information
[113.28 - 116.88] which is the most
[114.08 - 117.60] advanced healing information that exists
[116.88 - 119.52] today
[117.60 - 120.88] so many know it doctors know it so many
[119.52 - 122.40] other people know and i want you guys to
[120.88 - 123.36] learn about it too so today it's all
[122.40 - 125.68] about eggs
[123.36 - 126.56] and why they're not working for us and
[125.68 - 128.96] why we're getting
[126.56 - 130.48] sicker without realizing it and we don't
[128.96 - 132.48] blame the egg
[130.48 - 133.84] nobody blames the egg you'll blame a
[132.48 - 135.68] piece of fruit
[133.84 - 137.36] somebody will blame something else way
[135.68 - 138.48] before they'll blame all the eggs they
[137.36 - 140.72] eat all those years
[138.48 - 142.00] even if it was an egg once a year once a
[140.72 - 144.72] week once a month
[142.00 - 146.00] or once a day they won't blame the egg
[144.72 - 147.68] so i'm going to go into it
[146.00 - 150.56] so we're going to we're going to cover
[147.68 - 153.36] it so the medical industry
[150.56 - 154.72] is involved with why eggs are bad not
[153.36 - 157.12] because they're out there talking about
[154.72 - 158.64] eggs being bad but what happened is they
[157.12 - 162.56] were using eggs
[158.64 - 165.52] back years and years ago to raise bugs
[162.56 - 166.80] so bugs are why we're sick and we're
[165.52 - 168.24] going to go into this this is going to
[166.80 - 169.68] be really intense it's going to be
[168.24 - 171.68] really interesting
[169.68 - 174.80] and so much information i got to cover
[171.68 - 178.40] see basically what happened is viruses
[174.80 - 181.20] pathogens bacteria were raised in labs
[178.40 - 184.00] a long time ago back in the 1920s back
[181.20 - 186.00] in the 1930s back in the 1940s
[184.00 - 187.60] and so on and these bugs were raised in
[186.00 - 190.08] labs these are the bugs
[187.60 - 191.52] that got into people now that are into
[190.08 - 192.96] you if you have acne
[191.52 - 194.48] that's streptococcus i'm going to go
[192.96 - 195.84] into streptococcus all the different
[194.48 - 196.64] groups and stuff like that a little bit
[195.84 - 198.48] later
[196.64 - 199.76] but if you have acne that means you have
[198.48 - 201.44] strep in your system
[199.76 - 204.32] that strep is in your system because
[201.44 - 205.44] that strep left a lab back in the 1920s
[204.32 - 207.84] 1930s
[205.44 - 208.64] i don't know how mysteriously left the
[207.84 - 210.72] labs
[208.64 - 213.28] probably on purpose obviously so we can
[210.72 - 214.24] stay sick so we can be a sick society a
[213.28 - 217.20] sick culture
[214.24 - 219.04] 250 million americans alone are sick
[217.20 - 220.56] right now with symptoms and conditions
[219.04 - 222.24] and if you don't think you got a chronic
[220.56 - 224.80] illness if you have one symptom
[222.24 - 226.56] that comes and goes intermittently or if
[224.80 - 228.00] it just comes and goes periodically or
[226.56 - 229.60] you can't get rid of it or it's there
[228.00 - 230.48] all the time or you got two symptoms or
[229.60 - 232.32] three symptoms
[230.48 - 233.76] that's a chronic problem that's a
[232.32 - 235.36] chronic illness so
[233.76 - 238.00] do you suffer from autoimmune do you
[235.36 - 240.56] suffer from maxima psoriasis vitiligo
[238.00 - 242.56] lupus lyme disease endometriosis pcos
[240.56 - 243.52] fibroids breast cancer tingles numbness
[242.56 - 245.04] aches pains
[243.52 - 246.88] burning feelings sensations heart
[245.04 - 248.64] palpitations ringing in the ears vertigo
[246.88 - 251.20] dizziness tick spasms
[248.64 - 252.08] acne ibs crohn's bloating colitis
[251.20 - 254.40] fibromyalgia
[252.08 - 256.80] hundreds of more conditions they're
[254.40 - 258.56] caused by pathogens
[256.80 - 260.08] so you can get your best medical
[258.56 - 261.76] information out there alternative
[260.08 - 264.16] medicine or your best healer or your
[261.76 - 266.56] best advisor in in medical health
[264.16 - 268.56] and they won't tell you which bugs or
[266.56 - 270.96] bugs that are responsible for this
[268.56 - 271.68] responsible for all your illnesses and
[270.96 - 274.64] how eggs
[271.68 - 276.80] feed these bugs so this is critical
[274.64 - 280.40] information it's really important
[276.80 - 280.96] so in order for pathogens to stay alive
[280.40 - 283.28] they need
[280.96 - 284.00] food and everybody has pathogens in
[283.28 - 287.04] their body
[284.00 - 288.48] every other pathogens in their system
[287.04 - 290.64] that's how it works if you've had
[288.48 - 292.40] fibromyalgia if you've had a hashimoto's
[290.64 - 294.00] problem if you had a thyroid issue
[292.40 - 296.16] there's pathogens involved so we'll
[294.00 - 298.24] cover some of that too along the way
[296.16 - 299.68] so eczema psoriasis that's a virus
[298.24 - 302.48] inside the liver along with
[299.68 - 304.08] abundant amounts of copper a toxin that
[302.48 - 304.96] sits in the liver so i'll explain about
[304.08 - 308.00] that too so
[304.96 - 311.12] here's how it works viruses
[308.00 - 312.16] stay alive by feeding off of food inside
[311.12 - 314.32] of our body
[312.16 - 316.08] pathogens stay alive by feeding off of
[314.32 - 317.84] food inside our body so that's how it
[316.08 - 319.12] works i got some eggs right here
[317.84 - 320.88] of course you have to have the eggs
[319.12 - 323.36] right here right so
[320.88 - 324.32] when you're eating the eggs every day
[323.36 - 326.56] you're just
[324.32 - 328.16] bringing yourself closer to sickness now
[326.56 - 329.52] you could throw up a blind eye at this
[328.16 - 331.12] you can just throw your hands at it and
[329.52 - 332.80] be like okay what does he know
[331.12 - 334.08] what's going on here or whatever but
[332.80 - 335.60] because you're feeling good you might be
[334.08 - 336.16] young you might be indestructible at the
[335.60 - 337.44] moment
[336.16 - 339.12] you might be working out in the gym
[337.44 - 340.96] every single day you're 20 years old
[339.12 - 342.40] you're 25 years old you're 22 years old
[340.96 - 343.20] whatever and you're like no i have eggs
[342.40 - 344.80] on my salad
[343.20 - 347.28] i'm told it's a protein source i'm going
[344.80 - 349.68] to cover all that stuff but in the end
[347.28 - 351.84] you will get symptoms everybody does
[349.68 - 353.28] whether they get it at age 38 whether
[351.84 - 354.48] they start getting reproductive problems
[353.28 - 356.96] at age 35
[354.48 - 357.84] whether they get something at age 42
[356.96 - 360.24] they get it
[357.84 - 362.16] see that's the whole thing no one's
[360.24 - 364.96] going to escape that unless they
[362.16 - 366.00] really know what to do for themselves
[364.96 - 368.40] what do you actually do
[366.00 - 370.40] what to use for the health and and how
[368.40 - 372.88] to avoid things they shouldn't be eating
[370.40 - 373.52] because in the end everybody gets
[372.88 - 375.68] symptoms
[373.52 - 376.64] bottom line i've been doing this for 35
[375.68 - 378.40] plus years
[376.64 - 380.00] been involved with it i've talked to
[378.40 - 382.80] thousands of health professionals
[380.00 - 384.32] over the years i know how it works
[382.80 - 385.44] everybody gets symptoms if you don't
[384.32 - 386.80] think you're getting them now
[385.44 - 389.36] you're going to get them later so why
[386.80 - 391.28] not avoid them why not actually
[389.36 - 393.60] do something about it this is one of the
[391.28 - 395.76] most powerful ways to handle it is
[393.60 - 397.84] getting rid of these babies right here
[395.76 - 400.16] and so get them out of your diet no
[397.84 - 402.40] matter what and so look
[400.16 - 404.16] i'm not in the food wars okay we know
[402.40 - 405.76] that i'm not all about the food world
[404.16 - 407.44] meaning like you guys may not know if
[405.76 - 408.80] you're brand new to this it's the first
[407.44 - 410.64] time you're watching this
[408.80 - 412.56] with me or anything like that but people
[410.64 - 414.16] who know medical medium information
[412.56 - 415.76] know that i'm not involved with that
[414.16 - 417.60] whole food war thing where it's the
[415.76 - 419.04] vegans against the paleo's the paleo's
[417.60 - 420.56] against the vegans whether it's whatever
[419.04 - 422.08] diets that you know anybody subscribed
[420.56 - 423.60] to where animal protein against the
[422.08 - 425.84] non-animal protein people
[423.60 - 427.44] and how it goes and the flip-flopping
[425.84 - 429.04] that happens all in it where people
[427.44 - 430.40] leave the vegan world and they go back
[429.04 - 431.84] to animal proteins
[430.40 - 433.20] meanwhile they got sick to begin with
[431.84 - 434.64] off the animal proteins people leave the
[433.20 - 437.12] animal proteins they go back to vegan
[434.64 - 438.48] world they're all going back and forth
[437.12 - 440.24] and what's happening is everybody's
[438.48 - 441.52] guessing and everybody's still dealing
[440.24 - 443.44] and fighting with their symptoms
[441.52 - 444.80] as they go along the way or they get rid
[443.44 - 446.00] of symptoms for a little while and then
[444.80 - 449.20] they come back
[446.00 - 450.64] so not about just subscribing to one
[449.20 - 452.48] side of it or one hey
[450.64 - 454.48] veganism is the way to go or hey
[452.48 - 455.44] paleoism is the way to go it's not how
[454.48 - 458.16] i've ever been
[455.44 - 459.76] i'm about real answers real truth
[458.16 - 460.24] they're in the medical medium series
[459.76 - 462.40] books
[460.24 - 463.84] so you can actually be armed and be able
[462.40 - 465.76] to take care of yourself and help
[463.84 - 467.52] yourself heal and get better
[465.76 - 470.00] that's what it's about it's about making
[467.52 - 471.68] sure that mom who can't get out of bed
[470.00 - 473.68] to take care of her kids gets real
[471.68 - 475.60] answers for the first time after she's
[473.68 - 477.20] already been to five neurologists after
[475.60 - 478.88] she's already been to five other doctors
[477.20 - 480.16] or a dermatologist or
[478.88 - 482.00] however because of her excellent
[480.16 - 483.76] psoriasis or some other condition i'm
[482.00 - 486.16] all about making sure
[483.76 - 487.52] you get your information so you can heal
[486.16 - 489.84] and be empowered
[487.52 - 491.36] and rise above all the nonsense and the
[489.84 - 492.56] noise that's out there including the
[491.36 - 494.40] noise that's on youtube
[492.56 - 495.92] including the food war noise including
[494.40 - 497.12] everybody thinking they got their handle
[495.92 - 499.36] on a diet or whatever
[497.12 - 500.16] when in the end no one knows what causes
[499.36 - 502.08] illnesses
[500.16 - 503.68] they don't know the epstein-barr causes
[502.08 - 505.28] actual sickness like all the different
[503.68 - 507.28] conditions i mentioned earlier
[505.28 - 508.64] some of them many of them and they don't
[507.28 - 510.16] know about all the different shingles
[508.64 - 511.76] varieties the epstein-barr varieties the
[510.16 - 513.04] over 60 varieties so we're going into
[511.76 - 515.44] this stuff in depth
[513.04 - 518.80] um gonna have to actually drink a little
[515.44 - 518.80] celery juice keep me going here
[518.96 - 522.64] so let's go into a little bit more of
[522.00 - 524.24] this
[522.64 - 526.32] the basics let's just start out with the
[524.24 - 528.08] basics right here
[526.32 - 529.92] viruses and pathogens that are
[528.08 - 531.60] responsible for autoimmune
[529.92 - 533.44] and other illnesses if you've been
[531.60 - 535.04] diagnosed with an autoimmune condition
[533.44 - 536.64] of any kind and your doctor finally said
[535.04 - 538.00] hey it's autoimmune or you went online
[536.64 - 540.56] and looked and it's autoimmune
[538.00 - 542.00] whatever that is what that means without
[540.56 - 543.92] anybody telling you
[542.00 - 546.56] is that you have a condition where you
[543.92 - 549.36] have a pathogen inside the body
[546.56 - 551.68] causing problems creating neurotoxins
[549.36 - 552.72] creating dermatoxins like if it's eczema
[551.68 - 555.52] psoriasis
[552.72 - 557.68] that's a pathogen creating a toxin that
[555.52 - 560.32] floats to the skin this is advanced
[557.68 - 561.68] information now if you eat eggs
[560.32 - 563.60] if you're eating them or you ate them in
[561.68 - 566.80] the past you're feeding
[563.60 - 568.08] that pathogen you're feeding that virus
[566.80 - 569.52] and that's what's keeping you sick and
[568.08 - 570.96] that's what what's going to keep you
[569.52 - 571.76] sick so this is really important to
[570.96 - 574.96] understand
[571.76 - 577.28] so that's just a basic rundown of that
[574.96 - 578.88] so food is medicine you guys heard that
[577.28 - 580.48] everybody's heard that food is medicine
[578.88 - 582.56] food is medicine right
[580.48 - 584.64] what food that be that medicine all of
[582.56 - 585.28] it and you know you know the whole thing
[584.64 - 588.84] with that
[585.28 - 591.28] is food is medicine what's
[588.84 - 592.96] medicine with food if you don't know
[591.28 - 594.80] what causes illness
[592.96 - 596.48] how can you know what's good or bad for
[594.80 - 598.56] you how can you know as a health
[596.48 - 599.12] professional what's really good or bad
[598.56 - 601.44] for you
[599.12 - 603.44] how can you know as an influencer how
[601.44 - 606.00] can you know if somebody actually giving
[603.44 - 607.52] advice out there when you don't know
[606.00 - 609.20] what causes illness
[607.52 - 610.80] if you don't know what causes all the
[609.20 - 612.88] different symptoms and conditions
[610.80 - 614.32] how do you know what food is good or bad
[612.88 - 615.36] why do you think people are still eating
[614.32 - 618.80] eggs
[615.36 - 620.56] and that's how it works if people knew
[618.80 - 622.24] what was really wrong with them and what
[620.56 - 623.12] was causing illness and sickness out
[622.24 - 625.76] there
[623.12 - 627.04] eggs would actually get a bad rap like a
[625.76 - 628.32] really bad rap
[627.04 - 630.88] see that's the whole point so
[628.32 - 633.44] everybody's saying hey food is medicine
[630.88 - 634.24] but sure there are some good things in
[633.44 - 636.40] eggs
[634.24 - 638.16] but there's bad things in eggs too
[636.40 - 640.32] there's bad things that actually
[638.16 - 641.20] feed bugs and that's really important
[640.32 - 643.12] understand
[641.20 - 644.96] just because there's a nutrient in eggs
[643.12 - 647.12] or like omega-3 or something like that
[644.96 - 649.60] that you're being told is in an egg
[647.12 - 651.36] just because you know some omega-3s in
[649.60 - 652.72] here there's some protein in here
[651.36 - 654.48] something that you think is actually
[652.72 - 656.32] good for you or some nutrients and stuff
[654.48 - 657.68] like that just because that's in here
[656.32 - 658.72] doesn't mean there's something else that
[657.68 - 660.72] isn't in here
[658.72 - 661.76] that's causing trouble look the
[660.72 - 665.12] industries
[661.76 - 668.08] use this in labs as a food
[665.12 - 669.44] source for all the bugs that are keeping
[668.08 - 671.68] everybody down
[669.44 - 672.64] disempowering women and men actually
[671.68 - 674.96] hurting people
[672.64 - 676.64] keeping them sick hurting children
[674.96 - 678.72] keeping them sick
[676.64 - 680.56] that's what they did they did that
[678.72 - 681.36] without your permission no town hall
[680.56 - 684.48] meeting
[681.36 - 687.36] no vote no anything this was done
[684.48 - 688.56] without your decisions involved so eggs
[687.36 - 691.44] were actually
[688.56 - 693.28] ruined because of this okay and before
[691.44 - 695.20] all this yeah eggs will probably find
[693.28 - 697.92] food to eat why not
[695.20 - 698.24] why not so let's go into uh something
[697.92 - 699.84] called
[698.24 - 702.00] autoimmune i want to cover that a little
[699.84 - 703.60] bit why i want to talk about
[702.00 - 705.92] that when it comes down to eggs
[703.60 - 708.00] autoimmune and eggs and and kind of
[705.92 - 710.00] link that together so that's really
[708.00 - 712.00] important to talk about because so many
[710.00 - 712.72] of you with autoimmune conditions of any
[712.00 - 714.72] kind
[712.72 - 717.20] or symptoms that may not have been
[714.72 - 720.00] diagnosed as autoimmune or anything
[717.20 - 720.40] so many of you are actually eating eggs
[720.00 - 722.64] or
[720.40 - 723.84] go back to eating eggs or maybe come off
[722.64 - 725.60] of them and go back to them you know
[723.84 - 728.80] it's one of those things where
[725.60 - 730.16] it's a staple in all the diets maybe if
[728.80 - 731.84] you're not a vegan sure
[730.16 - 733.60] but you know what it's a lot of people
[731.84 - 735.20] they're not vegan long
[733.60 - 737.12] you know they're vegan for a very short
[735.20 - 739.52] time they're vegan for like five years
[737.12 - 740.32] yeah that's a short time that's a really
[739.52 - 742.00] short time
[740.32 - 743.92] or they're vegan for one year and
[742.00 - 745.68] they're back on eggs what do they do
[743.92 - 747.36] when vegans usually leave
[745.68 - 748.72] that whole thing plant-based people they
[747.36 - 750.40] go right back to eggs
[748.72 - 752.32] they do a little fish or they stay with
[750.40 - 755.36] eggs they bring on cheese or something
[752.32 - 757.28] or butter they usually start there but
[755.36 - 759.04] so i want to talk about how most
[757.28 - 760.48] everybody has been either been on eggs
[759.04 - 762.96] when they're younger or they're on
[760.48 - 763.68] eggs later or they're just on eggs every
[762.96 - 766.08] day
[763.68 - 769.44] so let's talk about this think about
[766.08 - 771.20] technology back in the 1950s late 1940s
[769.44 - 772.32] right think about technology think about
[771.20 - 774.48] the phones go watch an
[772.32 - 775.76] old movie i know i say this a lot watch
[774.48 - 778.32] an old movie
[775.76 - 780.00] and look at technology back in 1950 all
[778.32 - 781.84] right you'll be in shock
[780.00 - 783.36] because we're so used to tech now we're
[781.84 - 785.20] so used to life now we're so used to
[783.36 - 787.52] what's happening now okay
[785.20 - 788.32] and so go back and look at that and when
[787.52 - 790.24] you look at that
[788.32 - 792.16] you'll see the old phones you'll see the
[790.24 - 794.48] old cars cars as big as
[792.16 - 795.20] as big as boats you'll see all of that
[794.48 - 798.24] you know
[795.20 - 800.80] and what happens is when you realize
[798.24 - 801.52] technology was where it was at then you
[800.80 - 804.56] have to realize
[801.52 - 805.84] medicine was where technology was at
[804.56 - 808.72] back then too
[805.84 - 811.12] it was in the dark ages okay that was
[808.72 - 813.92] the dark ages of medicine
[811.12 - 815.68] that was where theories were born just
[813.92 - 817.36] like now theories are here now
[815.68 - 819.20] we're still you know in the dark ages in
[817.36 - 820.16] many ways because you know hey they
[819.20 - 821.84] still don't even know what causes
[820.16 - 824.32] chronic illness and autoimmune but think
[821.84 - 827.12] about as far as back in the late 1940s
[824.32 - 828.64] early 1950s well that's when the
[827.12 - 831.76] autoimmune theory was
[828.64 - 833.44] birthed that's when it was born okay so
[831.76 - 834.72] if you're someone who's young right now
[833.44 - 836.08] if you're someone that's already been to
[834.72 - 837.68] a couple doctors you've got a little bit
[836.08 - 839.52] of eczema and you're realizing it's
[837.68 - 841.68] autoimmune or you've got some swelling
[839.52 - 844.08] on the body or you got something that's
[841.68 - 844.80] you're getting a diagnosis of lupus or
[844.08 - 846.00] you just got
[844.80 - 847.76] symptoms that are actually being
[846.00 - 849.20] classified as autoimmune are you dealing
[847.76 - 850.80] with a little fibromyalgia or chronic
[849.20 - 852.48] fatigue syndrome or whatever it is
[850.80 - 854.24] that's all in the autoimmune family or
[852.48 - 856.64] lyme disease now pushed in autoimmune
[854.24 - 858.08] i'm going to go into that more detail it
[856.64 - 861.52] whatever you're dealing with
[858.08 - 863.92] okay autoimmune is a theory still
[861.52 - 865.36] the word is a theory the concept is a
[863.92 - 868.40] theory your sickness is
[865.36 - 871.28] real your symptoms are real they are
[868.40 - 872.08] very real way more real than the
[871.28 - 875.04] industry
[872.08 - 875.60] lets you feel or know because that's how
[875.04 - 878.56] it is
[875.60 - 880.24] by saying it's autoimmune they're saying
[878.56 - 882.08] your body's attacking itself they're
[880.24 - 883.76] saying your body's destroying itself so
[882.08 - 884.72] that's what they're doing so think about
[883.76 - 886.32] that for a minute
[884.72 - 887.92] here you are you go to a doctor it's not
[886.32 - 889.68] the doctor's fault doctors work for the
[887.92 - 890.96] industry it's not doctors are amazing
[889.68 - 893.04] it's not about the doctor
[890.96 - 894.16] but you go to the doctor and the
[893.04 - 895.76] doctor's gonna be like yeah you have an
[894.16 - 896.24] autoimmune condition that's what you
[895.76 - 898.08] have
[896.24 - 899.52] so now you're you're making your protein
[898.08 - 900.88] shakes now you're making your smoothies
[899.52 - 902.64] now you're having your hard-boiled eggs
[900.88 - 904.32] on salads now you're doing all this
[902.64 - 905.84] because you're trying to eat healthy go
[904.32 - 907.20] to a good functional medicine doctor and
[905.84 - 908.40] they'll like get off a gluten get off of
[907.20 - 909.60] this get off of that
[908.40 - 911.76] but they still think you have an
[909.60 - 914.24] autoimmune condition they're still
[911.76 - 916.48] following that 1950s
[914.24 - 917.52] theory where your body's attacking
[916.48 - 919.84] itself
[917.52 - 921.36] see autoimmune means your body's immune
[919.84 - 922.24] system is attacking the glands and
[921.36 - 924.72] organs
[922.24 - 925.60] that's what it means that's a theory
[924.72 - 928.96] that occurred
[925.60 - 933.04] back in the technology of that you know
[928.96 - 935.20] old school of the 1940s and the 1950s
[933.04 - 936.80] that was a theory that came up because
[935.20 - 937.52] science of research had to protect
[936.80 - 940.08] itself
[937.52 - 940.72] because millions of patients were coming
[940.08 - 943.44] in
[940.72 - 944.64] with new symptoms for the first time in
[943.44 - 947.12] history
[944.64 - 949.36] so please know that and there's no
[947.12 - 950.48] science proven autoimmune yet the
[949.36 - 952.24] autoimmune theory
[950.48 - 954.56] there's no science or research that can
[952.24 - 957.68] actually prove the autoimmune
[954.56 - 958.88] theory okay that's how it works you can
[957.68 - 960.64] look all you want
[958.88 - 962.72] they'll still say your body's attacking
[960.64 - 963.52] itself and they'll talk about an auto
[962.72 - 966.16] antibody
[963.52 - 966.96] but they could never find that auto
[966.16 - 969.84] antibody
[966.96 - 970.40] causing harm it's not possible it's
[969.84 - 973.52] still
[970.40 - 974.40] a complete and total theory a farce
[973.52 - 976.72] actually
[974.40 - 977.84] it's basically a ruse played on you and
[976.72 - 981.20] i'll tell you why
[977.84 - 983.44] it's to train you that you have a faulty
[981.20 - 985.36] body that your sickness is your fault
[983.44 - 986.72] it's not a pathogen it's not the
[985.36 - 988.64] epstein-barr virus
[986.72 - 990.64] it's not this it's not that the industry
[988.64 - 991.92] doesn't want you knowing these truths
[990.64 - 993.84] the industry doesn't want you knowing
[991.92 - 995.36] any of that the industry wants to keep
[993.84 - 997.28] you sick that's how the money machine
[995.36 - 999.52] works you've heard of that right
[997.28 - 1001.84] well it's like that with autoimmune the
[999.52 - 1004.00] theory so this is how it works
[1001.84 - 1005.28] in the 1950s they didn't know why all
[1004.00 - 1007.84] these people were sick
[1005.28 - 1009.84] they were pouring in and pouring in
[1007.84 - 1011.04] symptoms they'd never seen before i've
[1009.84 - 1012.96] even talked to old
[1011.04 - 1014.96] doctors back in the day when they were
[1012.96 - 1016.24] already 90 years old after practicing
[1014.96 - 1018.16] way back then
[1016.24 - 1019.84] and i've and i've talked to them and
[1018.16 - 1021.04] they've told me how it all worked and
[1019.84 - 1024.16] what was happening
[1021.04 - 1026.96] and the autoimmune theory was just a way
[1024.16 - 1028.48] to confuse people to protect science and
[1026.96 - 1029.92] research because these signs of research
[1028.48 - 1032.96] has to protect itself
[1029.92 - 1034.72] and it uses you and women kind to do so
[1032.96 - 1036.96] not in all fields i'm talking about
[1034.72 - 1038.16] chronic illness so just know this not in
[1036.96 - 1039.76] all fields
[1038.16 - 1041.04] you know when i talk to scientists
[1039.76 - 1042.72] they'll say the same thing they'll say
[1041.04 - 1043.36] it doesn't it doesn't protect itself all
[1042.72 - 1046.72] the time in
[1043.36 - 1047.36] other areas and but it does in chronic
[1046.72 - 1049.52] illness and
[1047.36 - 1051.04] women suffering and struggling so when
[1049.52 - 1053.04] women come in with all their different
[1051.04 - 1054.48] symptoms or heart palpitations oh it's
[1053.04 - 1056.80] their hormones
[1054.48 - 1058.56] or all it's you know or their fatigue
[1056.80 - 1060.56] their severe fatigue oh it's their body
[1058.56 - 1062.16] attacking itself or it's in their head
[1060.56 - 1065.20] and they're creating it
[1062.16 - 1068.00] or it's genes these are techniques used
[1065.20 - 1069.36] for the industry to protect itself so
[1068.00 - 1071.92] first of all the industry
[1069.36 - 1072.72] used eggs to raise all of these
[1071.92 - 1075.28] pathogens
[1072.72 - 1076.56] that make us sick then when everybody
[1075.28 - 1079.12] got sick
[1076.56 - 1081.36] and is getting sick now and pouring into
[1079.12 - 1083.12] their offices and still today like never
[1081.36 - 1084.24] before in history we have an epidemic
[1083.12 - 1087.36] right now right
[1084.24 - 1089.04] now that people are pouring in sick they
[1087.36 - 1090.56] use the old theory that came out the
[1089.04 - 1092.24] protected research and science the
[1090.56 - 1094.24] grandfather law theory which is the
[1092.24 - 1094.56] body's attacking itself how do you like
[1094.24 - 1097.92] them
[1094.56 - 1100.08] apples huh exactly so so
[1097.92 - 1102.00] you're going to be say 22 years old 21
[1100.08 - 1103.92] years old maybe 40 years old maybe 45
[1102.00 - 1105.68] years old with your first diagnosis you
[1103.92 - 1107.20] got a thyroid problem oh wait a minute i
[1105.68 - 1108.80] got hashimoto's thyroiditis so i got
[1107.20 - 1110.64] hyperthyroidism
[1108.80 - 1112.40] and you're going to find out that's your
[1110.64 - 1114.32] body attacking itself there's no answers
[1112.40 - 1114.80] out there so there's no answers out
[1114.32 - 1116.72] there
[1114.80 - 1118.08] whether you like it or not about me
[1116.72 - 1119.60] telling you this truth whether you're
[1118.08 - 1121.44] somebody that's like ah that's not true
[1119.60 - 1123.92] there's answers no no no i trust my
[1121.44 - 1125.44] doctor no no i trust research in science
[1123.92 - 1127.44] i trust all the different non-gluten
[1125.44 - 1128.88] diets i trust everything
[1127.44 - 1131.12] but you know what there's there's
[1128.88 - 1132.96] something i call bullshitting yourself
[1131.12 - 1135.12] and that's what people do every day and
[1132.96 - 1136.88] they actually themselves to
[1135.12 - 1139.04] still eat eggs that i've learned i'm
[1136.88 - 1141.92] going to talk about that a little bit
[1139.04 - 1144.32] here's here's how it works it's
[1141.92 - 1146.64] important to know what causes sickness
[1144.32 - 1147.44] so you can actually help others move
[1146.64 - 1150.00] forward
[1147.44 - 1151.84] rise out of this it's important to know
[1150.00 - 1154.48] that pathogens
[1151.84 - 1155.20] cause sickness heavy metals cause
[1154.48 - 1158.32] sickness
[1155.20 - 1161.60] mercury aluminum you know lead arsenic
[1158.32 - 1164.32] uh nickel you know cadmium copper cause
[1161.60 - 1165.04] illness and heavy metals like mercury
[1164.32 - 1168.72] okay
[1165.04 - 1171.60] with foods like eggs feed bugs
[1168.72 - 1172.56] that keep us sick that keep us down that
[1171.60 - 1174.32] keep us hurting
[1172.56 - 1176.48] that keep us fatigued that keeper keep
[1174.32 - 1178.80] give us thyroid problems and so forth
[1176.48 - 1179.60] you have to break out of that whole
[1178.80 - 1181.60] thing
[1179.60 - 1183.04] where you actually think that your body
[1181.60 - 1185.20] is attacking itself
[1183.04 - 1186.64] or that you that you cause the problem
[1185.20 - 1189.60] or its genes
[1186.64 - 1190.00] or it's even the wrong foods you're
[1189.60 - 1191.36] eating
[1190.00 - 1193.12] people will be like well it's fruit
[1191.36 - 1194.08] that's causing my hashimoto's that's
[1193.12 - 1196.88] actually not even
[1194.08 - 1198.08] possible fruit cannot feed pathogens
[1196.88 - 1200.88] like viruses
[1198.08 - 1202.32] they can't feed that they're actually
[1200.88 - 1205.44] blueberries
[1202.32 - 1207.52] help you get rid of pathogens they help
[1205.44 - 1209.44] you get rid of viruses
[1207.52 - 1211.28] they help you heal that's the whole
[1209.44 - 1212.32] point and so you need to know there's
[1211.28 - 1215.20] certain foods that
[1212.32 - 1215.76] are medicine and there's foods that
[1215.20 - 1218.08] aren't
[1215.76 - 1220.56] medicine that's why it's so important
[1218.08 - 1222.08] here that's why i'm talking about this
[1220.56 - 1223.92] so many people are sick because they're
[1222.08 - 1225.60] eating the wrong foods
[1223.92 - 1227.28] and they think it's medicine they think
[1225.60 - 1229.52] the wrong food is healing
[1227.28 - 1231.12] and that's how it works they're also
[1229.52 - 1232.08] told their body's attacking itself so
[1231.12 - 1234.40] they're given no
[1232.08 - 1236.32] answers it's why there are so many
[1234.40 - 1237.76] people healing with medical medium
[1236.32 - 1239.28] information the reason why there's so
[1237.76 - 1240.00] many people healing with medical medium
[1239.28 - 1241.76] information
[1240.00 - 1243.76] globally out there because of the
[1241.76 - 1245.92] millions of books that got out there
[1243.76 - 1247.12] all in the world is because they have
[1245.92 - 1249.60] the truth
[1247.12 - 1251.84] and they and they know better not to
[1249.60 - 1253.04] just yes themselves they know it they
[1251.84 - 1254.32] know what they've been through they've
[1253.04 - 1256.56] been to 10 doctors
[1254.32 - 1258.08] they've been to 15 doctors they've seen
[1256.56 - 1258.96] how hard it is they've been to four
[1258.08 - 1261.36] neurologists
[1258.96 - 1262.88] they've been through hell and back they
[1261.36 - 1263.52] bend down on their hands and knees
[1262.88 - 1266.00] suffering
[1263.52 - 1268.00] and they paid tons of money and they put
[1266.00 - 1268.56] so much money out in so many different
[1268.00 - 1269.92] ways
[1268.56 - 1272.08] and they've suffered and they've
[1269.92 - 1275.12] struggled okay and they know
[1272.08 - 1276.24] this and so what happens is those people
[1275.12 - 1278.16] that have healed through the medical
[1276.24 - 1278.72] medium information know not to eat eggs
[1278.16 - 1280.16] but hey
[1278.72 - 1281.84] but this might be the first time you've
[1280.16 - 1284.24] ever seen a video of me
[1281.84 - 1285.76] first time you ever heard about my books
[1284.24 - 1287.76] so we're gonna go into more of this so
[1285.76 - 1290.00] just back to the autoimmune theory
[1287.76 - 1291.68] it's not your body attacking itself
[1290.00 - 1294.08] that's not how it works
[1291.68 - 1295.04] and that's just a complete and total
[1294.08 - 1297.36] fraudulent
[1295.04 - 1300.40] theory that was created to protect
[1297.36 - 1303.44] science because there were no answers
[1300.40 - 1305.76] and so every single illness now is
[1303.44 - 1306.56] classified practically every single you
[1305.76 - 1309.84] have to understand
[1306.56 - 1312.16] it's not just 10 illnesses 20 illnesses
[1309.84 - 1312.88] or a hundred we're in hundreds of
[1312.16 - 1315.20] different
[1312.88 - 1316.80] conditions now are classified in the
[1315.20 - 1319.84] autoimmune category
[1316.80 - 1322.08] because they have no answers
[1319.84 - 1323.36] and then you're supposed to believe your
[1322.08 - 1324.80] body caused it
[1323.36 - 1326.88] and then when you sit there with that
[1324.80 - 1328.08] autoimmune diagnosis you're eating your
[1326.88 - 1330.00] eggs
[1328.08 - 1331.36] because you're told by some dietitian i
[1330.00 - 1332.00] mean i love dietitians there's some
[1331.36 - 1333.44] really great ones
[1332.00 - 1335.28] out there that know about medical medium
[1333.44 - 1336.88] information and or more decent
[1335.28 - 1338.56] information in general
[1336.88 - 1340.32] but you'll be told by some dietitian and
[1338.56 - 1342.00] keep on doing the eggs you'll be told by
[1340.32 - 1344.08] a nutritionist keep on eating your eggs
[1342.00 - 1345.68] because it's high in protein
[1344.08 - 1347.20] and then what happens is if you've even
[1345.68 - 1348.72] started recovering because you got rid
[1347.20 - 1350.32] of certain foods like you got rid of
[1348.72 - 1351.36] gluten and you got rid of fried foods
[1350.32 - 1352.56] and you've been eating healthy and
[1351.36 - 1353.84] you're exercising a little and you're
[1352.56 - 1355.28] starting to do some recovery and you're
[1353.84 - 1356.40] seeing a good functional medicine doctor
[1355.28 - 1357.76] and you're taking good supplements
[1356.40 - 1358.72] you're starting to just come out of it a
[1357.76 - 1359.76] little bit you're still going to be
[1358.72 - 1361.84] eating eggs
[1359.76 - 1363.52] and then boom years later you get a new
[1361.84 - 1364.24] problem boom you get or you get a
[1363.52 - 1365.76] relapse
[1364.24 - 1367.92] or you just you're back to where you
[1365.76 - 1370.40] were before see
[1367.92 - 1371.76] they don't know what causes illnesses
[1370.40 - 1374.08] that's how it works
[1371.76 - 1376.08] you go to practitioners they don't know
[1374.08 - 1377.36] not all practitioners know the ones that
[1376.08 - 1378.24] actually know about medical medium
[1377.36 - 1379.92] information
[1378.24 - 1381.36] they know what's going on they know
[1379.92 - 1383.44] what's causing diseases
[1381.36 - 1385.20] they know that epstein-barr one of the
[1383.44 - 1386.72] 60 varieties of epstein-barr which i'll
[1385.20 - 1388.88] talk about in a little bit
[1386.72 - 1390.80] what that is about they know that that
[1388.88 - 1392.00] virus causes more than a little bit of
[1390.80 - 1393.92] tiredness
[1392.00 - 1395.36] it causes aches and pains it causes
[1393.92 - 1397.44] fibromyalgia it causes
[1395.36 - 1398.48] rheumatoid arthritis it causes eczema
[1397.44 - 1400.24] and psoriasis
[1398.48 - 1401.92] it causes hashimoto's thyroiditis it
[1400.24 - 1403.28] causes multiple sclerosis it causes
[1401.92 - 1405.12] aches and pains tingles and numbness
[1403.28 - 1406.56] ringing the ears vertigo that's just the
[1405.12 - 1409.44] touch of what it causes
[1406.56 - 1411.76] okay and that's not even pcos because it
[1409.44 - 1413.28] causes pcos too and some reproductive
[1411.76 - 1415.12] problems and conditions
[1413.28 - 1416.48] so that's what epstein-barr causes
[1415.12 - 1417.36] you're not going to get that you're not
[1416.48 - 1418.88] going to get that clear
[1417.36 - 1420.88] information instead you'll be told to
[1418.88 - 1422.96] keep on eating your eggs and that
[1420.88 - 1424.16] yeah you have autoimmune and you need to
[1422.96 - 1425.68] do maybe an aip
[1424.16 - 1427.44] diet or some other kind of diet and so
[1425.68 - 1428.72] forth and it's not that i'm against any
[1427.44 - 1430.16] diets that's not it
[1428.72 - 1433.12] it's just that it can't subscribe to a
[1430.16 - 1435.12] belief system what happens is people
[1433.12 - 1436.88] they fall into a belief system they have
[1435.12 - 1439.12] no choice they fall into a belief system
[1436.88 - 1440.88] and that's what they do i can't do that
[1439.12 - 1442.72] that's why i'm not in the food wars
[1440.88 - 1444.24] that's why i'm not like you know i'm not
[1442.72 - 1445.68] throwing stones at the vegans i'm not
[1444.24 - 1447.04] throwing stones at the paleo
[1445.68 - 1449.12] you know people they can eat animal
[1447.04 - 1450.80] protein i'm just gonna teach you
[1449.12 - 1453.44] what foods actually feed the real
[1450.80 - 1455.36] problems why people are really sick
[1453.44 - 1457.68] how to do something about that and
[1455.36 - 1458.88] that's what the youtube subs live series
[1457.68 - 1460.08] is going to be about like i'm going to
[1458.88 - 1461.28] be bringing on the guests i'm going to
[1460.08 - 1462.72] be bringing on other people
[1461.28 - 1464.40] in the future episodes what we're going
[1462.72 - 1466.24] to be doing but i'm going to make sure
[1464.40 - 1468.56] you have the answers you need so let's
[1466.24 - 1471.60] talk about lyme disease a little bit
[1468.56 - 1473.36] i want to cover that lyme disease
[1471.60 - 1475.52] everybody thought it was all sewed up
[1473.36 - 1477.20] they all thought it was bacteria it was
[1475.52 - 1479.44] bacterial you got the bartonella
[1477.20 - 1480.88] you got the babesia got the borrelia and
[1479.44 - 1482.08] that's what they thought it all was in
[1480.88 - 1484.32] the past okay
[1482.08 - 1486.48] that was the whole thing now you just
[1484.32 - 1488.16] need to know something because of the
[1486.48 - 1489.68] medical medium information
[1488.16 - 1491.44] and the millions of books that got out
[1489.68 - 1493.36] there in the world and the amount of
[1491.44 - 1494.08] doctors using the medical medium
[1493.36 - 1496.40] information
[1494.08 - 1498.16] at this point now in time the lyme
[1496.40 - 1500.24] disease information has changed out
[1498.16 - 1502.64] there because of medical medium books
[1500.24 - 1503.92] it is actually altered so which is
[1502.64 - 1506.08] actually a good thing
[1503.92 - 1507.84] but it's what happened out there the
[1506.08 - 1509.20] industry is sneaky though
[1507.84 - 1510.56] they don't like when this information
[1509.20 - 1512.16] gets out there they don't like when the
[1510.56 - 1514.08] truth gets out there because they know
[1512.16 - 1515.44] it threatens them in so many ways it
[1514.08 - 1516.64] threatens them from making money it
[1515.44 - 1518.00] threatens them in different ways from
[1516.64 - 1520.08] taking control
[1518.00 - 1521.68] they don't want women kind taking
[1520.08 - 1522.48] control over their lives over their
[1521.68 - 1523.84] health
[1522.48 - 1526.08] and they want to make sure they sell as
[1523.84 - 1527.68] many antibiotics as they possibly can so
[1526.08 - 1528.00] the lyme disease movement is all about
[1527.68 - 1529.92] selling
[1528.00 - 1531.52] as many antibiotics as possible the
[1529.92 - 1533.28] industry wants to do it they've made
[1531.52 - 1535.20] trillion dollars on antibiotics in the
[1533.28 - 1536.72] last 35 years still a lot of money no
[1535.20 - 1538.80] one wants to lose that
[1536.72 - 1540.96] so but what happened with the medical
[1538.80 - 1541.68] medium information the truth got out
[1540.96 - 1543.20] there
[1541.68 - 1546.00] thousands and thousands of doctors just
[1543.20 - 1548.56] in this country alone and globally
[1546.00 - 1549.84] know that lyme disease is viral that
[1548.56 - 1553.36] bacteria can't
[1549.84 - 1555.04] cause a neurotoxic response
[1553.36 - 1556.40] like all of the neurological lyme
[1555.04 - 1558.88] patients go through
[1556.40 - 1560.32] i actually broke that information out
[1558.88 - 1561.84] there in the world through through my
[1560.32 - 1563.12] source that you guys learn about if
[1561.84 - 1564.32] you've never heard about that it's all
[1563.12 - 1566.56] in the books
[1564.32 - 1568.48] and so that information is changing the
[1566.56 - 1570.96] world but what the industry did to try
[1568.48 - 1571.92] to kind of like catch up to itself a
[1570.96 - 1574.40] little bit they took
[1571.92 - 1575.28] lyme disease they removed it from
[1574.40 - 1577.12] bacteria
[1575.28 - 1578.80] category even though the lyme labs still
[1577.12 - 1581.20] test for bacteria and all that they took
[1578.80 - 1582.88] it from this category of just bacteria
[1581.20 - 1584.32] bacterial and they placed it in the
[1582.88 - 1587.28] autoimmune category
[1584.32 - 1589.04] they now say lyme disease is in the
[1587.28 - 1590.80] autoimmune category
[1589.04 - 1593.44] now it can't be in the autoimmune
[1590.80 - 1595.76] category if it's bacterial related
[1593.44 - 1598.32] but you see how that works they just
[1595.76 - 1600.00] took lyme disease after 35 years
[1598.32 - 1601.52] out from underneath everybody no one's
[1600.00 - 1603.60] even realizing it
[1601.52 - 1604.72] and they placed it in the autoimmune
[1603.60 - 1606.64] category
[1604.72 - 1608.56] which means they're telling you that
[1606.64 - 1610.40] your lyme disease and lyme symptoms are
[1608.56 - 1612.88] now your body attacking itself wait a
[1610.40 - 1614.56] minute wasn't it bacteria for 35 years
[1612.88 - 1616.32] didn't they literally bomb the hell out
[1614.56 - 1618.88] of people with antibiotics
[1616.32 - 1620.32] decade after decade and tortured women
[1618.88 - 1622.64] kind and tortured people
[1620.32 - 1624.16] literally i mean people have suffered
[1622.64 - 1625.76] you wouldn't believe if you don't know
[1624.16 - 1627.60] about this you wouldn't believe with
[1625.76 - 1629.12] lyme people lyme patients have gone
[1627.60 - 1631.20] through in the hell they've been through
[1629.12 - 1632.16] it's so heartbreaking you just can't
[1631.20 - 1635.36] even imagine
[1632.16 - 1637.68] you can't even imagine see they placed
[1635.36 - 1640.08] it in the autoimmune category
[1637.68 - 1641.44] for a reason because we've altered the
[1640.08 - 1642.72] information out there
[1641.44 - 1645.04] because people are healing when they
[1642.72 - 1648.16] realize it's viral
[1645.04 - 1651.12] see look babesia bartonella borrelia
[1648.16 - 1653.76] they're not superbugs they can't harm
[1651.12 - 1655.20] you like people really believe so
[1653.76 - 1657.04] see that's how it works they can't
[1655.20 - 1658.80] produce a neurotoxin
[1657.04 - 1660.40] because they can't produce a neurotoxin
[1658.80 - 1662.24] like viruses like epstein-barr
[1660.40 - 1665.12] hhv-6 shingles varieties and other
[1662.24 - 1667.12] viruses hhv-7 simplexes and so forth
[1665.12 - 1669.20] they can't produce a neurotoxin
[1667.12 - 1671.12] neurotoxins is why people suffer with
[1669.20 - 1673.84] neurological lyme symptoms
[1671.12 - 1675.36] that's how it works and the industry
[1673.84 - 1676.96] they got kind of wise to what was
[1675.36 - 1678.24] happening and what was shifting so they
[1676.96 - 1680.48] took the actual
[1678.24 - 1682.40] diagnosis of lyme disease that condition
[1680.48 - 1684.32] and they placed it in autoimmune
[1682.40 - 1686.24] now they're teaching people that's your
[1684.32 - 1688.24] body attacking itself that's what it is
[1686.24 - 1689.92] they're leaving the bacteria
[1688.24 - 1692.64] aspect of it out of it because the
[1689.92 - 1695.84] bacteria was never the problem
[1692.64 - 1697.84] mrsa has a higher healing response rate
[1695.84 - 1701.04] of recovery with antibiotics
[1697.84 - 1703.76] than bartonella babisia okay because
[1701.04 - 1704.24] and borrelia there's a reason for that
[1703.76 - 1707.52] because
[1704.24 - 1710.08] mrsa is a real superbug but yet has a
[1707.52 - 1711.68] higher response rate in recovery the
[1710.08 - 1712.80] reason why people with lyme
[1711.68 - 1714.24] suffered all these years with
[1712.80 - 1715.92] antibiotics and they've been they've
[1714.24 - 1718.24] been bombarded with antibiotics in their
[1715.92 - 1719.76] system and haven't had good recoveries
[1718.24 - 1721.52] and they've even gotten worse so many of
[1719.76 - 1724.96] them is because
[1721.52 - 1728.40] they were viral when you use antibiotics
[1724.96 - 1730.80] for viral conditions you suffer worse
[1728.40 - 1732.08] that's how it works and that's what
[1730.80 - 1735.20] happens
[1732.08 - 1736.72] see if the bacteria borrelia and the and
[1735.20 - 1738.56] the hybrid babesia
[1736.72 - 1740.24] and the bartonella were the true causes
[1738.56 - 1742.72] of lyme disease antibiotics would kill
[1740.24 - 1744.40] them off so simply and easily
[1742.72 - 1746.72] because they're not superbugs like even
[1744.40 - 1748.32] mrsa and mrsa has a higher kill off in a
[1746.72 - 1750.16] response rate of recovery
[1748.32 - 1752.64] my god i've known so many people that
[1750.16 - 1754.24] have you know had mrsa and recovered and
[1752.64 - 1755.84] that's like the superbug one of the
[1754.24 - 1759.12] superbugs
[1755.84 - 1760.80] and that's how it works see lime lyme
[1759.12 - 1762.00] people people that have dealt with lyme
[1760.80 - 1763.28] disease and everything else and they're
[1762.00 - 1766.00] dealing with the symptoms neurological
[1763.28 - 1768.16] lyme and all that lyme disease patients
[1766.00 - 1769.28] would be freed up in a heartbeat from an
[1768.16 - 1771.68] antibiotic
[1769.28 - 1772.88] and a heartbeat and and it would never
[1771.68 - 1775.04] come back
[1772.88 - 1776.72] and so but the reason why they don't and
[1775.04 - 1778.48] they end up getting sick again or they
[1776.72 - 1780.64] end up suffering either way
[1778.48 - 1782.64] the reason why it's always been viral
[1780.64 - 1785.04] that's why antibiotics are being phased
[1782.64 - 1787.36] out of lyme disease protocols
[1785.04 - 1788.96] doctors now lyme doctors are using half
[1787.36 - 1790.40] the amount a quarter of the amount
[1788.96 - 1792.72] now they're bringing it down to a
[1790.40 - 1794.72] fraction because they know better
[1792.72 - 1796.00] they've seen the wake of the hell that
[1794.72 - 1797.60] has happened and they've seen what
[1796.00 - 1798.88] people have gone through
[1797.60 - 1800.96] and what do they do though everybody
[1798.88 - 1802.96] just tells everybody to eat eggs just
[1800.96 - 1804.96] everybody just eat eggs i mean that's
[1802.96 - 1806.88] how it works just lots of eggs
[1804.96 - 1809.12] and so and those eggs feed the viruses
[1806.88 - 1811.20] behind lyme disease
[1809.12 - 1813.12] so the medical medium information was to
[1811.20 - 1815.28] bring out the truth that it's viral
[1813.12 - 1817.68] that it's viral neurotoxins produced by
[1815.28 - 1819.84] viruses causing neurological lyme
[1817.68 - 1821.68] the industry got wise they placed it in
[1819.84 - 1824.08] the autoimmune category now
[1821.68 - 1825.52] okay that's how it is and now the
[1824.08 - 1827.12] autoimmune category means your body's
[1825.52 - 1828.80] attacking itself wait a minute what lyme
[1827.12 - 1830.40] wasn't bacteria i'm confused now the
[1828.80 - 1831.52] body's attacking itself what is it down
[1830.40 - 1832.32] they're slipping in there and they're
[1831.52 - 1834.64] kind of like
[1832.32 - 1836.16] and all the big doctors now and all the
[1834.64 - 1837.68] big protocols they're backing down on
[1836.16 - 1839.44] the antibiotics you see and then they're
[1837.68 - 1840.88] using more natural things they're using
[1839.44 - 1842.32] more natural stuff they're using the
[1840.88 - 1844.40] diets and people are recovering but the
[1842.32 - 1846.80] reason why they're starting to recover
[1844.40 - 1848.32] is because they're viral and that when
[1846.80 - 1849.76] you clean up your diet and your diet
[1848.32 - 1851.20] gets better especially with the medical
[1849.76 - 1852.56] medium information of what foods to
[1851.20 - 1854.00] eliminate when you clean up your diet
[1852.56 - 1854.40] and everything starts to go down you
[1854.00 - 1855.84] start
[1854.40 - 1857.52] getting rid of all the bad foods
[1855.84 - 1859.92] including the eggs
[1857.52 - 1861.44] that's right your symptoms start to back
[1859.92 - 1863.04] down and they start to back down and you
[1861.44 - 1864.80] start to recover
[1863.04 - 1866.64] and so that's just a whole example of
[1864.80 - 1868.56] lyme disease autoimmune
[1866.64 - 1870.24] how things work how the system out there
[1868.56 - 1871.44] works the trickery of what's happening
[1870.24 - 1874.00] the aspect of it all
[1871.44 - 1875.84] so it's so important to know this so
[1874.00 - 1877.36] just to recap real quick before we move
[1875.84 - 1878.00] on because we're moving on to some cool
[1877.36 - 1880.32] stuff
[1878.00 - 1881.84] without a doubt so a little recap on
[1880.32 - 1883.68] things okay
[1881.84 - 1884.96] and i love the comments coming up it's
[1883.68 - 1886.88] incredible so
[1884.96 - 1889.20] um i'm gonna answer questions if if the
[1886.88 - 1890.80] eggs are organic is that a good thing so
[1889.20 - 1892.56] we'll cover that in a little bit
[1890.80 - 1893.68] um the whole bit so there's because
[1892.56 - 1895.12] there's important things to know about
[1893.68 - 1896.16] how eggs work so i'll check out the
[1895.12 - 1900.24] comments too
[1896.16 - 1903.36] um let's go into food as medicine
[1900.24 - 1905.52] so what food is medicine okay is it egg
[1903.36 - 1907.92] medicine is it egg medicinal no it's not
[1905.52 - 1909.68] it's not a medicine it's not medicinal
[1907.92 - 1910.96] this is so important to understand it's
[1909.68 - 1913.44] critical okay
[1910.96 - 1914.16] spinach is a medicine so just know the
[1913.44 - 1916.64] difference
[1914.16 - 1918.08] get the reference you know like like
[1916.64 - 1920.24] know what we're talking about
[1918.08 - 1921.20] like all of us are talking about right
[1920.24 - 1924.32] just like
[1921.20 - 1925.44] spinach is medicine yeah of course it is
[1924.32 - 1927.52] you know that i mean
[1925.44 - 1929.12] of course you know it's medicine i mean
[1927.52 - 1930.72] a pile of spinach in front of you
[1929.12 - 1932.32] you know that's medicinal you know
[1930.72 - 1934.96] that's medicine okay
[1932.32 - 1937.28] eggs no they're not medicine and there's
[1934.96 - 1938.88] a spark in us that knows that why do you
[1937.28 - 1940.56] think eggs in moderation
[1938.88 - 1942.88] you've heard that oh eat eggs in
[1940.56 - 1944.08] moderation why could you probably get a
[1942.88 - 1945.20] heart attack and die they're worried
[1944.08 - 1947.04] about like yeah
[1945.20 - 1948.64] that's one of the things like why eat
[1947.04 - 1951.20] eggs in moderation
[1948.64 - 1952.08] you've heard that one spinach in
[1951.20 - 1954.16] moderation
[1952.08 - 1955.52] i don't think so you can eat spinach all
[1954.16 - 1957.20] you want the whole bit
[1955.52 - 1958.40] i mean but eggs in moderation that
[1957.20 - 1959.52] phrase came around because of high
[1958.40 - 1962.00] cholesterol
[1959.52 - 1962.96] because of because of plaque in the
[1962.00 - 1965.04] arteries
[1962.96 - 1966.72] because of your blood clots because of
[1965.04 - 1967.60] all kinds of other issues high blood
[1966.72 - 1968.88] pressure
[1967.60 - 1971.36] so that's so that's where eggs in
[1968.88 - 1974.56] moderation was a concern
[1971.36 - 1977.68] because it's not a medicine it's not
[1974.56 - 1980.48] it's actually a food that's you know
[1977.68 - 1981.20] constantly promoted by backers of the
[1980.48 - 1982.72] industry
[1981.20 - 1985.36] for a reason so we'll go into that a
[1982.72 - 1988.00] little bit celery juice
[1985.36 - 1989.12] is this medicine or is this not medicine
[1988.00 - 1991.68] it's medicine
[1989.12 - 1993.20] spinach medicine wild blueberries
[1991.68 - 1995.68] medicine
[1993.20 - 1996.72] blueberries medicine potato even a
[1995.68 - 2000.00] potato
[1996.72 - 2001.20] medicine so you know potato without
[2000.00 - 2004.24] cream without butter
[2001.20 - 2006.56] without you know without any of that yes
[2004.24 - 2007.52] in important you know potatoes without
[2006.56 - 2009.92] cream butter
[2007.52 - 2011.68] cheese all of that so i want to talk
[2009.92 - 2013.84] about potato for a second somebody
[2011.68 - 2014.72] like out there you guys might be vibing
[2013.84 - 2016.40] us the
[2014.72 - 2017.92] feeling well potato is not medicine
[2016.40 - 2020.32] potatoes terrible for you i'm on this
[2017.92 - 2020.64] certain diet potatoes bad for me oh i'm
[2020.32 - 2022.32] just
[2020.64 - 2023.60] i'm gonna just completely all this
[2022.32 - 2025.04] information doesn't mean anything to me
[2023.60 - 2027.44] now because i've learned potatoes are
[2025.04 - 2028.56] bad out there from some kind of diet
[2027.44 - 2030.80] so if you're somebody that's getting
[2028.56 - 2032.56] that that feeling of like why is he
[2030.80 - 2033.04] talking about potato there's something
[2032.56 - 2037.76] called
[2033.04 - 2039.60] lysine lysine is inside potato
[2037.76 - 2042.08] people are suffering out there with the
[2039.60 - 2043.92] epstein-barr viruses the shingles riot
[2042.08 - 2045.12] do you know anybody that has jaw pain
[2043.92 - 2046.48] neck pain that they're it's
[2045.12 - 2048.64] unexplainable
[2046.48 - 2050.16] they got trigeminal neuralgia they got
[2048.64 - 2051.92] migraines they got headaches that's the
[2050.16 - 2054.40] shingles virus that can cause
[2051.92 - 2056.08] all of that chronic sciatic nerves
[2054.40 - 2057.60] sciatica problems if you know a relative
[2056.08 - 2059.44] or a friend that has a back problem that
[2057.60 - 2061.76] just doesn't want to back down
[2059.44 - 2063.36] surgery or no surgery or whatever it is
[2061.76 - 2065.60] shingles variety see shingles there's
[2063.36 - 2066.88] over 30 varieties of undiscovered
[2065.60 - 2068.88] shingles varieties i mean that's the
[2066.88 - 2071.44] whole thing see epstein-barr
[2068.88 - 2072.72] there's over 60 varieties only one they
[2071.44 - 2074.56] have discovered out there
[2072.72 - 2076.32] they don't have the over 60 price of
[2074.56 - 2079.84] mutations and strains
[2076.32 - 2081.68] so let's go into this a little bit um
[2079.84 - 2082.72] we're talking about foods as foods as
[2081.68 - 2085.68] medicine we're talking about the
[2082.72 - 2088.96] potatoes the lysine lysine
[2085.68 - 2090.24] actually harms viruses so that's how it
[2088.96 - 2092.08] works so just pretend
[2090.24 - 2093.68] you know just pretend that look this is
[2092.08 - 2095.28] a virus i got the little critter in my
[2093.68 - 2096.96] hand right here i've done this before
[2095.28 - 2100.40] say that's the virus the pathogen the
[2096.96 - 2102.48] invader lysine when you eat a potato
[2100.40 - 2104.16] starts to hurt the invader starts to
[2102.48 - 2106.72] take down the invader starts to take
[2104.16 - 2108.96] down the pathogen that's how it works so
[2106.72 - 2109.76] potato has something in it that is
[2108.96 - 2112.16] medicine
[2109.76 - 2113.28] to stop conditions that lyme suffers
[2112.16 - 2115.20] fibromyalgia
[2113.28 - 2116.48] chronic fatigue syndrome you know me
[2115.20 - 2117.52] chronic fatigue syndrome all the
[2116.48 - 2119.92] different conditions
[2117.52 - 2121.28] just regular fatigue all of it people
[2119.92 - 2123.36] that suffer with
[2121.28 - 2124.80] what happens is potato actually helps
[2123.36 - 2126.16] you heal it is one of the foods is
[2124.80 - 2127.68] medicine but it shows you how the
[2126.16 - 2129.28] industries don't know this
[2127.68 - 2131.28] and they'll just be like oh it's a carb
[2129.28 - 2132.96] toss it or whatever but that's a prime
[2131.28 - 2134.72] example of how the industries and how
[2132.96 - 2136.16] people in the diet fads and trends don't
[2134.72 - 2137.44] know what causes your symptoms or
[2136.16 - 2139.84] conditions or illnesses
[2137.44 - 2140.48] that's how it works celery juice is a
[2139.84 - 2142.96] medicine
[2140.48 - 2143.68] helps to actually destroy and kill off
[2142.96 - 2146.00] bugs
[2143.68 - 2148.00] so it actually helps to kill off viruses
[2146.00 - 2150.24] and that's what's important
[2148.00 - 2152.64] so i'm going into stuff like that no one
[2150.24 - 2154.56] eats potatoes by itself so caught a bad
[2152.64 - 2156.40] wraps everybody eats potatoes with sour
[2154.56 - 2158.40] cream they protect you know the potatoes
[2156.40 - 2160.56] cheese on it with butter on it so yeah
[2158.40 - 2161.84] it is it it actually is bad for you at
[2160.56 - 2163.12] that point it's not going to help you
[2161.84 - 2164.88] with all of that on there
[2163.12 - 2166.24] and they put oil on it all of that
[2164.88 - 2168.16] doesn't help so yeah
[2166.24 - 2169.60] it catches a bad wrap and rightfully so
[2168.16 - 2170.48] if you're going to do all that to it it
[2169.60 - 2172.32] doesn't work
[2170.48 - 2174.16] so let's go into another thing too
[2172.32 - 2176.32] everybody is guessing out there so that
[2174.16 - 2178.96] leads me into this next part
[2176.32 - 2180.88] everybody's guessing that's how it works
[2178.96 - 2181.76] so everybody in the industry is they're
[2180.88 - 2184.24] guessing
[2181.76 - 2186.40] to what food is right to what can heal
[2184.24 - 2189.60] you to what is good it's all
[2186.40 - 2191.76] guessing games that's how it works much
[2189.60 - 2194.16] of it built off of theories
[2191.76 - 2197.28] it's a prime example how everyone is
[2194.16 - 2198.88] guessing and no one knows how to heal
[2197.28 - 2200.56] and you can watch this on people's
[2198.88 - 2201.76] youtube channels you can see you can see
[2200.56 - 2203.12] what they were doing two years ago on
[2201.76 - 2204.00] the youtube channel you can see all of a
[2203.12 - 2205.04] sudden they're doing this and they're
[2204.00 - 2205.92] changing it up and they're starting to
[2205.04 - 2207.36] get a little better and they start
[2205.92 - 2208.40] getting a little worse again
[2207.36 - 2210.24] and they're confused and they're
[2208.40 - 2211.04] shifting their diet or you can see it on
[2210.24 - 2212.32] the youtube or
[2211.04 - 2214.08] you know different episodes of people
[2212.32 - 2215.60] where it goes back a few years ago or a
[2214.08 - 2217.36] couple years ago you can watch the
[2215.60 - 2219.92] progression now
[2217.36 - 2221.28] of people getting sicker too you can
[2219.92 - 2222.72] watch that too you can see it when
[2221.28 - 2224.16] they're younger and then three years
[2222.72 - 2225.28] later they're starting to get excellent
[2224.16 - 2226.16] for the first time in their life
[2225.28 - 2227.68] they're starting to get something for
[2226.16 - 2229.12] the first time in your life and you can
[2227.68 - 2230.56] actually witness this
[2229.12 - 2231.92] and they're trying different diets and
[2230.56 - 2233.20] different trends and they're working out
[2231.92 - 2235.68] and you can see
[2233.20 - 2237.20] where everybody really still doesn't
[2235.68 - 2239.52] know what they're doing everybody is
[2237.20 - 2240.08] guessing including the big diet people
[2239.52 - 2241.68] out there
[2240.08 - 2243.76] being the people that back the trends
[2241.68 - 2245.20] the people that actually start the big
[2243.76 - 2246.80] diet trends out there
[2245.20 - 2248.16] they don't know what actually heals
[2246.80 - 2248.88] somebody or doesn't heal somebody
[2248.16 - 2252.08] because
[2248.88 - 2255.20] once again how can you actually know
[2252.08 - 2255.60] what heals someone when you don't know
[2255.20 - 2258.80] what
[2255.60 - 2259.20] causes their illness so critical to know
[2258.80 - 2260.56] so
[2259.20 - 2262.24] if you're suffering with any chronic
[2260.56 - 2264.48] illness say just
[2262.24 - 2265.76] you think about that for two seconds how
[2264.48 - 2268.72] does anybody know
[2265.76 - 2270.48] which you know how to heal someone if
[2268.72 - 2273.20] they don't know what's causing
[2270.48 - 2274.88] the problem you have to know the cause
[2273.20 - 2275.36] in order to heal you have to know the
[2274.88 - 2277.12] cause
[2275.36 - 2278.96] you have to know what's causing your
[2277.12 - 2280.80] illness so then you can know
[2278.96 - 2282.48] not to eat this when you have pcos when
[2280.80 - 2285.20] you have endometriosis
[2282.48 - 2286.08] when you have you know chronic utis when
[2285.20 - 2288.32] you have all kinds of different
[2286.08 - 2290.64] conditions or reproductive conditions
[2288.32 - 2291.36] you no one's going to know hey you can't
[2290.64 - 2293.04] eat that
[2291.36 - 2294.88] because that's going to feed a virus
[2293.04 - 2296.64] that's responsible for your condition
[2294.88 - 2298.08] or breast cancer same thing with breast
[2296.64 - 2299.92] cancer no one's going to know
[2298.08 - 2301.12] hey you know that's the thing when
[2299.92 - 2302.16] people get breast cancer they're told to
[2301.12 - 2304.88] eat more eggs
[2302.16 - 2306.80] when people get pcos they're told to eat
[2304.88 - 2308.32] more eggs and people get endometriosis
[2306.80 - 2310.00] they're told to eat more eggs they're so
[2308.32 - 2311.60] no eat eggs eat this and they'll say
[2310.00 - 2313.12] sure eat salads and
[2311.60 - 2315.76] and some vegetables and eat your
[2313.12 - 2317.44] vegetables and maybe have a few berries
[2315.76 - 2319.92] you'll hear all that stuff out there but
[2317.44 - 2323.28] they'll leave the eggs in there 100
[2319.92 - 2326.00] which will make pcos worse and worse
[2323.28 - 2327.92] and worse and so that's an example so
[2326.00 - 2329.04] how is it possible
[2327.92 - 2331.12] that everybody knows what they're
[2329.04 - 2332.64] talking about there out there about what
[2331.12 - 2334.40] can heal and what can help
[2332.64 - 2335.76] when they don't even know the cause of
[2334.40 - 2336.88] the pcos
[2335.76 - 2338.96] they don't know the cause of the
[2336.88 - 2341.52] endometriosis they don't know the
[2338.96 - 2342.88] constant cause of chronic utis
[2341.52 - 2344.40] they don't know the cause of your eczema
[2342.88 - 2345.84] psoriasis they don't know the cause of
[2344.40 - 2347.44] your fibromyalgia your multiple
[2345.84 - 2348.56] sclerosis your aches and pains your
[2347.44 - 2350.24] tingles and numbness your chronic
[2348.56 - 2350.64] vertigo your balance issues your brain
[2350.24 - 2352.80] fog
[2350.64 - 2354.48] if they are the cause of your brain fog
[2352.80 - 2355.92] then how do they know what's going to
[2354.48 - 2358.08] heal it
[2355.92 - 2360.00] and so the medical mean information is
[2358.08 - 2361.92] all about getting those answers
[2360.00 - 2363.44] it's like that with breast cancer they
[2361.92 - 2364.72] don't know the cause of breast cancer
[2363.44 - 2366.88] because they still don't know the cause
[2364.72 - 2368.24] they're just starting to link up steam
[2366.88 - 2370.48] bar virus because that is
[2368.24 - 2371.68] the true cause just starting to link
[2370.48 - 2373.20] that finally
[2371.68 - 2374.72] with all the medical medium information
[2373.20 - 2376.48] that's gotten out there for all these
[2374.72 - 2377.52] years and it just finally the length of
[2376.48 - 2378.80] that it's just fine
[2377.52 - 2380.32] i talked to scientists and lab
[2378.80 - 2381.68] technicians that are pro medical medium
[2380.32 - 2382.88] information out there
[2381.68 - 2385.68] i'm going to interview some of them
[2382.88 - 2386.88] along the way and they'll talk about how
[2385.68 - 2389.28] yeah i mean
[2386.88 - 2390.96] this is the information this is the way
[2389.28 - 2393.28] to go look
[2390.96 - 2394.24] chronic illness isn't about laying in a
[2393.28 - 2396.80] bed dying
[2394.24 - 2398.32] and and and believe me there's plenty of
[2396.80 - 2399.68] people out there doing that it's the
[2398.32 - 2401.60] saddest thing out there
[2399.68 - 2403.68] it's a saddest thing it's heartbreaking
[2401.60 - 2406.96] it's disturbing in so many ways
[2403.68 - 2407.52] it's it's heart crushing but chronic
[2406.96 - 2412.00] illness
[2407.52 - 2414.08] is any symptom condition that you got
[2412.00 - 2415.12] or you're developing or going to develop
[2414.08 - 2416.88] 10 years from now
[2415.12 - 2418.72] are going to develop it's easy when
[2416.88 - 2420.56] you're 20 years old and just really you
[2418.72 - 2422.80] don't have much going on
[2420.56 - 2424.72] and then all of a sudden you start
[2422.80 - 2425.52] getting that brain fog while you're 27
[2424.72 - 2427.04] years old
[2425.52 - 2428.40] and that brain fog is getting in the way
[2427.04 - 2429.52] of your career getting in the way of
[2428.40 - 2431.20] things and then all of a sudden you find
[2429.52 - 2432.80] your thyroid count is off your
[2431.20 - 2433.92] if your thyroid numbers are off and all
[2432.80 - 2436.00] of a sudden you find other things are
[2433.92 - 2438.80] going on and it's happening to everyone
[2436.00 - 2441.28] no one's escaping it's happening but you
[2438.80 - 2443.12] can stop it you can learn how to heal it
[2441.28 - 2444.40] you can figure out how to you can figure
[2443.12 - 2446.24] out what the cause is
[2444.40 - 2447.52] all of that's possible that's the whole
[2446.24 - 2449.76] point so
[2447.52 - 2451.44] it's so critical to know so a chronic
[2449.76 - 2453.60] symptom and condition
[2451.44 - 2455.28] chronic illness is any symptom you're
[2453.60 - 2455.76] battling with or struggling with that
[2455.28 - 2458.40] isn't
[2455.76 - 2458.96] helping you that is hurting you in some
[2458.40 - 2461.60] way
[2458.96 - 2462.96] or lowering the quality of your life or
[2461.60 - 2465.36] reducing you know
[2462.96 - 2466.88] your your positive nature your outlook
[2465.36 - 2468.16] on life because you're just bummed out
[2466.88 - 2470.64] because you got these symptoms and
[2468.16 - 2472.88] whatever it is the symptom is
[2470.64 - 2474.08] they actually those symptoms keep us
[2472.88 - 2476.40] down
[2474.08 - 2478.08] and they keep us down and that's that's
[2476.40 - 2480.08] chronic illness chronic illness isn't
[2478.08 - 2482.24] the person that's in a bed dying and
[2480.08 - 2483.52] there's like i said so many are in that
[2482.24 - 2486.72] condition
[2483.52 - 2487.68] and it's so sad but chronic illness is
[2486.72 - 2488.88] all kinds of stuff
[2487.68 - 2490.16] it's all kinds of symptoms that you're
[2488.88 - 2491.68] dealing with so let's talk about the
[2490.16 - 2495.20] protein and eggs
[2491.68 - 2496.32] um so yeah so it's great comments coming
[2495.20 - 2498.56] up thanks guys
[2496.32 - 2499.76] really appreciate it i love doing this
[2498.56 - 2501.68] live
[2499.76 - 2503.44] not edited or anything it's like youtube
[2501.68 - 2505.36] live it's just so fun to do
[2503.44 - 2507.20] the protein and eggs let's go into that
[2505.36 - 2508.88] a little bit okay
[2507.20 - 2510.72] is it good for us hey you should eat
[2508.88 - 2511.20] your eggs because of protein so maybe we
[2510.72 - 2512.56] should have
[2511.20 - 2514.24] eggs because the protein look at all
[2512.56 - 2515.36] this protein here so you'll hear it over
[2514.24 - 2517.20] and over and over again it's like a
[2515.36 - 2519.60] brainwashing out there
[2517.20 - 2520.64] and but what no one understands or
[2519.60 - 2524.16] nobody knows
[2520.64 - 2526.56] or no one realizes is protein
[2524.16 - 2528.88] was one of the food sources that was
[2526.56 - 2531.20] given to bugs to keep them alive
[2528.88 - 2532.48] it's one of the sources so it's protein
[2531.20 - 2535.60] inside eggs
[2532.48 - 2538.16] that kept bugs alive in the labs they
[2535.60 - 2540.00] learn to feed off of the sticky protein
[2538.16 - 2542.08] that's in eggs
[2540.00 - 2544.00] so that's what happened so when you're
[2542.08 - 2546.00] eating egg proteins
[2544.00 - 2547.68] they're slowly feeding things because
[2546.00 - 2549.36] everybody has things in them
[2547.68 - 2551.04] and they will get something eventually
[2549.36 - 2552.32] they'll pick it up they'll pick it up in
[2551.04 - 2554.88] different ways pick it up from
[2552.32 - 2556.96] a new relationship people in new
[2554.88 - 2558.88] relationships pass the bugs along
[2556.96 - 2560.08] say somebody has acne okay and they've
[2558.88 - 2562.40] taken antibiotics for
[2560.08 - 2564.08] their acne over and over again that
[2562.40 - 2566.32] streptococcus that they have
[2564.08 - 2568.56] which causes their cystic acne because
[2566.32 - 2571.52] that's the true cause of acne
[2568.56 - 2572.96] that strep actually gets stronger and
[2571.52 - 2574.80] stronger with antibiotics then you get
[2572.96 - 2576.72] into a new relationship that strep gets
[2574.80 - 2578.40] passed to another person and that person
[2576.72 - 2580.72] has that streptococcus
[2578.40 - 2582.32] and so we we tend to pass all of these
[2580.72 - 2584.16] bugs around and then bugs continue to
[2582.32 - 2586.56] get stronger as the years go on we pass
[2584.16 - 2588.80] along the epstein bars we which is mono
[2586.56 - 2590.56] nucleosis we pass along all the
[2588.80 - 2592.00] different h pylori
[2590.56 - 2593.76] we pass along these things we get them
[2592.00 - 2595.60] from restaurant food we get them from
[2593.76 - 2596.88] restaurant glasses we get them from
[2595.60 - 2598.88] all kinds of different things we get
[2596.88 - 2600.96] them from people not washing their hands
[2598.88 - 2602.96] and working in places we get them from
[2600.96 - 2604.96] public bathrooms we just get
[2602.96 - 2606.64] bugs and we're going to get them along
[2604.96 - 2608.00] the way in our life one way or another
[2606.64 - 2609.20] because we're going to sit on a plane
[2608.00 - 2610.80] somewhere and we're going to
[2609.20 - 2613.60] pick up a bug somewhere and we're going
[2610.80 - 2615.68] to be in a on a plane bathroom
[2613.60 - 2617.44] and we're just going to get bugs in her
[2615.68 - 2618.72] life if we're not careful we're not
[2617.44 - 2620.32] cautious but we're going to get him
[2618.72 - 2622.88] that's how life works
[2620.32 - 2625.04] with those bugs they just they incubate
[2622.88 - 2627.04] over time i'm just being straight out
[2625.04 - 2629.20] i'm just telling it like it is because
[2627.04 - 2630.96] if i if i keep the truth from you and i
[2629.20 - 2632.64] act like you know and i just
[2630.96 - 2633.92] talk silly stuff out there like you
[2632.64 - 2635.36] should have some butter in your coffee
[2633.92 - 2636.88] or something or if i talk silly
[2635.36 - 2639.36] stuff out there like you should be doing
[2636.88 - 2639.76] this that and not have the answers to
[2639.36 - 2642.32] heal
[2639.76 - 2643.76] it's not enough we need more i want to
[2642.32 - 2645.60] protect you it's about protecting
[2643.76 - 2647.12] yourself it's about making sure you have
[2645.60 - 2649.52] the answer so you can protect yourself
[2647.12 - 2651.44] so we actually pass around these bugs
[2649.52 - 2654.08] and then we eat eggs and we feed the
[2651.44 - 2655.84] bugs we may not see a problem in a while
[2654.08 - 2657.36] sometimes we go through a lot of stress
[2655.84 - 2659.12] we go through some emotional heartaches
[2657.36 - 2660.56] some heartbreaks things like that trust
[2659.12 - 2662.08] gets broken next thing you know what our
[2660.56 - 2663.68] immune system gets knocked down a little
[2662.08 - 2664.88] bit and then the bugs that we have
[2663.68 - 2667.12] floating around in us
[2664.88 - 2668.56] get left lots of ample food we have some
[2667.12 - 2670.32] eggs and then we get in trouble with
[2668.56 - 2671.92] that i haven't covered the emotional
[2670.32 - 2673.68] aspect about eggs and why we're so
[2671.92 - 2674.88] attached to them and how i understand
[2673.68 - 2677.20] i want to do that too i don't want to
[2674.88 - 2677.52] forget about that the other thing that's
[2677.20 - 2680.32] in
[2677.52 - 2681.68] eggs are hormones let's cover that now
[2680.32 - 2682.96] some of you out there might be like well
[2681.68 - 2684.80] he's talking about hormones and eggs but
[2682.96 - 2686.96] i eat organic eggs they free-range eggs
[2684.80 - 2688.08] i eat my own eggs no no no i'm talking
[2686.96 - 2690.48] about
[2688.08 - 2691.12] the hormones that are in those those
[2690.48 - 2693.36] eggs
[2691.12 - 2694.80] these these are organic eggs right here
[2693.36 - 2696.96] and there's hormones in these
[2694.80 - 2699.04] they're just not added but there's
[2696.96 - 2701.12] hormones naturally occurring to grow
[2699.04 - 2703.84] that baby chicken that's how important
[2701.12 - 2706.00] it is to understand this stuff and so
[2703.84 - 2706.88] these hormones were another food used in
[2706.00 - 2709.60] labs to raise
[2706.88 - 2711.04] all of the bugs that keep us sick sick
[2709.60 - 2712.24] let's just cover the bugs for two
[2711.04 - 2714.32] seconds first okay
[2712.24 - 2716.16] so there's over 60 varieties of
[2714.32 - 2716.56] epstein-barr mutated strains and so
[2716.16 - 2718.64] forth
[2716.56 - 2720.32] over 30 varieties of shingles
[2718.64 - 2721.92] undiscovered by research and science
[2720.32 - 2722.24] that plague people left and right out
[2721.92 - 2724.72] there
[2722.24 - 2725.92] they give them a neuropathy they give
[2724.72 - 2727.36] them all kinds of aches and pains
[2725.92 - 2729.28] trigeminal neuralgia
[2727.36 - 2730.64] they give them bell's palsy everything
[2729.28 - 2732.56] so there's all these different kinds of
[2730.64 - 2733.28] shingles varieties out there non-rashing
[2732.56 - 2736.64] and rashing
[2733.28 - 2737.20] there's hhv-6s there's hhv-7s out there
[2736.64 - 2739.68] too
[2737.20 - 2741.04] there's simplex 1 simplex 2 and all the
[2739.68 - 2742.48] different mutations and varieties that
[2741.04 - 2743.28] are being passed around all over the
[2742.48 - 2745.36] place
[2743.28 - 2746.48] and then there's cytomegalovirus there's
[2745.36 - 2748.48] that one as well
[2746.48 - 2750.72] then there's the undiscovered hhv 10s
[2748.48 - 2752.00] 11s 12's 13s through 16
[2750.72 - 2754.00] that scientific research doesn't even
[2752.00 - 2754.96] have their finger or pulse on on any
[2754.00 - 2756.32] level
[2754.96 - 2757.52] so you got all these different viruses
[2756.32 - 2759.76] then you have the different varieties of
[2757.52 - 2762.24] streptococcus over 50 groups of strep
[2759.76 - 2763.76] now are developing over 50 groups and
[2762.24 - 2766.40] multiple strains per
[2763.76 - 2768.16] group you can't even the alphabet won't
[2766.40 - 2768.72] even cover it now you speak group a
[2768.16 - 2772.08] group b
[2768.72 - 2775.04] strap group c uh um you know d
[2772.08 - 2776.80] h whatever and you know the whole bit e
[2775.04 - 2778.32] so what happens is that
[2776.80 - 2780.48] i probably got it backwards right there
[2778.32 - 2782.16] but the groups have different strains
[2780.48 - 2784.08] and multiple mutations
[2782.16 - 2785.92] these are all the bugs i'm talking about
[2784.08 - 2787.52] that are keeping everybody sick
[2785.92 - 2789.28] you can arm yourself you can knock them
[2787.52 - 2790.80] down you can clean up your illnesses you
[2789.28 - 2792.08] can be like other people medical medium
[2790.80 - 2793.12] information in the books that actually
[2792.08 - 2794.80] understand this stuff
[2793.12 - 2796.72] and actually realize that doctors don't
[2794.80 - 2797.44] know that most doctors don't even have
[2796.72 - 2799.28] an idea
[2797.44 - 2801.04] or or know about this it's not their
[2799.28 - 2802.48] fault all doctors are good because they
[2801.04 - 2804.32] want people to heal they're in it their
[2802.48 - 2804.72] hearts in it i know lots of doctors work
[2804.32 - 2806.00] with them
[2804.72 - 2807.76] there's doctors on the front of these
[2806.00 - 2809.12] books that that have written
[2807.76 - 2810.96] forwards on the front of these books and
[2809.12 - 2814.08] there's amazing physicians out there
[2810.96 - 2815.60] done incredible work out there but when
[2814.08 - 2817.52] it comes down to eggs you're just going
[2815.60 - 2819.68] to feed the bugs so much as this this is
[2817.52 - 2822.24] so important to know about
[2819.68 - 2823.52] so it doesn't matter if it's organic
[2822.24 - 2825.36] doesn't matter if it's free range
[2823.52 - 2826.80] doesn't matter if you grew it yourself
[2825.36 - 2827.20] it's going to have hormones in it that
[2826.80 - 2828.88] feed
[2827.20 - 2830.96] the viruses it's going to have a protein
[2828.88 - 2833.52] that feeds viruses and bacteria
[2830.96 - 2835.20] and keep us sick that's the bottom line
[2833.52 - 2836.80] so all of this is important to know
[2835.20 - 2839.60] about let's keep on going a little bit
[2836.80 - 2841.52] further and all this so
[2839.60 - 2842.88] a lot of people ask the question and
[2841.52 - 2844.00] this is a good one a lot of people ask
[2842.88 - 2847.04] the question
[2844.00 - 2848.64] um is raw egg okay
[2847.04 - 2850.72] so that's what they'll do is raw egg
[2848.64 - 2852.88] okay the whole bit now
[2850.72 - 2854.80] raw egg is definitely better than cooked
[2852.88 - 2856.40] egg but still with raw egg you got to
[2854.80 - 2858.24] worry about other problems
[2856.40 - 2859.92] one being the main problem it'll feed
[2858.24 - 2862.32] your pathogens it'll still
[2859.92 - 2863.28] feed everything viruses will will eat
[2862.32 - 2865.44] raw egg
[2863.28 - 2867.20] they'll be cooked egg pathogens will eat
[2865.44 - 2867.92] raw egg cooked egg that's just what they
[2867.20 - 2869.28] do
[2867.92 - 2871.20] and then when you cook an egg you
[2869.28 - 2872.64] denature what's even good in it that
[2871.20 - 2874.80] people think is good in it so the
[2872.64 - 2875.12] omega-3 everybody says is good in eggs
[2874.80 - 2877.12] you
[2875.12 - 2879.12] cook it you destroy it so you're not
[2877.12 - 2880.88] even using the omega-3
[2879.12 - 2882.40] so anybody who says well hey look
[2880.88 - 2883.84] there's omega-3 in eggs
[2882.40 - 2885.20] yeah good luck getting it if you're
[2883.84 - 2887.84] cooking it because you're destroying the
[2885.20 - 2889.68] omega-3 you can't cook omega-3
[2887.84 - 2891.76] it won't work in your body it just it
[2889.68 - 2893.28] just it can't be used
[2891.76 - 2895.52] same thing with proteins they become
[2893.28 - 2897.44] denatured you can't cook proteins
[2895.52 - 2898.72] they become denatured you cook an egg
[2897.44 - 2900.88] protein it's denatured
[2898.72 - 2902.56] so if you eat a raw egg you'll get the
[2900.88 - 2905.28] omega-3 you'll get the protein
[2902.56 - 2907.04] but you'll feed the bugs all the same
[2905.28 - 2907.92] and maybe even get yourself salmonella
[2907.04 - 2909.60] or a food-borne
[2907.92 - 2912.72] illness if you eat rags too so you got
[2909.60 - 2915.12] to be careful it's a whole nother thing
[2912.72 - 2915.76] here's the thing i have nothing against
[2915.12 - 2918.32] eggs
[2915.76 - 2919.92] okay if anything and i got nothing to
[2918.32 - 2922.96] gain doing this
[2919.92 - 2924.96] all i get is is flack from actually
[2922.96 - 2926.24] telling the truth that's all i get
[2924.96 - 2926.64] that's how it works out there in the
[2926.24 - 2928.64] world
[2926.64 - 2930.72] you tell the truth you go against the
[2928.64 - 2931.92] industry you actually let the truth out
[2930.72 - 2933.92] to get people to heal
[2931.92 - 2935.44] all you do is get crap for it that's the
[2933.92 - 2937.28] bottom line okay
[2935.44 - 2939.52] but the only thing i have to gain is you
[2937.28 - 2940.80] healing and that that's true i have that
[2939.52 - 2942.32] to gain because i know that i could
[2940.80 - 2943.44] sleep at night knowing that you have
[2942.32 - 2945.04] answers
[2943.44 - 2946.40] while i'm in this lifetime now that you
[2945.04 - 2946.96] have the answers so you can work on
[2946.40 - 2949.12] healing
[2946.96 - 2950.64] that's critical to me okay but other
[2949.12 - 2951.04] than that there's nothing to gain with
[2950.64 - 2952.64] this
[2951.04 - 2954.96] it's not like i have anything against
[2952.64 - 2955.44] eggs it actually tastes really good i
[2954.96 - 2957.76] mean
[2955.44 - 2959.68] i mean eggs people love them they taste
[2957.76 - 2962.16] great it's emotional connection
[2959.68 - 2964.08] our moms made eggs or dads made eggs or
[2962.16 - 2965.92] grandparents made eggs there's so many
[2964.08 - 2968.00] people all that through the
[2965.92 - 2969.84] the family line you know we went to
[2968.00 - 2972.40] diners right did you guys all go to
[2969.84 - 2974.16] diners and have eggs in your lifetime
[2972.40 - 2976.08] you know maybe somebody got drunk and
[2974.16 - 2977.04] went to a diner after a college party or
[2976.08 - 2979.20] something whatever it is
[2977.04 - 2981.04] just just you know had eggs there's all
[2979.20 - 2984.56] these emotional connections
[2981.04 - 2985.04] people have with eggs down to the family
[2984.56 - 2987.52] line
[2985.04 - 2988.24] goes back in history i mean i mean down
[2987.52 - 2990.56] to
[2988.24 - 2993.28] the food that's made to egg salad that's
[2990.56 - 2995.20] made by you know a family recipe
[2993.28 - 2996.56] a potato salad with eggs mayonnaise
[2995.20 - 2998.64] whatever it's just whatever it is
[2996.56 - 3000.72] mayonnaise and eggs and all this stuff
[2998.64 - 3002.32] there's so much going on there
[3000.72 - 3003.92] and there's so you know with omelets and
[3002.32 - 3006.40] fried eggs and scrambled eggs and
[3003.92 - 3007.84] all the way people like them you know
[3006.40 - 3008.96] and i get that and i completely
[3007.84 - 3011.12] understand
[3008.96 - 3012.08] and i know that connection is deep in
[3011.12 - 3014.48] people
[3012.08 - 3016.32] but see you know what happens is the
[3014.48 - 3019.04] industry
[3016.32 - 3020.96] they don't care about your family they
[3019.04 - 3022.24] don't care about you and your health
[3020.96 - 3025.44] they want you to think your body's
[3022.24 - 3027.76] attacking itself they want you on eggs
[3025.44 - 3029.36] they want you sick and they want you
[3027.76 - 3030.80] playing guessing games
[3029.36 - 3032.40] and they want you throwing stones at
[3030.80 - 3033.76] each other and throwing fake science at
[3032.40 - 3035.20] each other you know like the vegans and
[3033.76 - 3036.56] the paleos do and everybody else
[3035.20 - 3037.20] everybody's throwing all this stuff at
[3036.56 - 3038.64] each other
[3037.20 - 3040.56] and the iep and everybody's just
[3038.64 - 3041.68] throwing all the stuff because everybody
[3040.56 - 3043.44] thinks they have the answers when they
[3041.68 - 3045.60] don't even know what causes
[3043.44 - 3047.60] anything that's the whole thing i don't
[3045.60 - 3050.64] even know what causes anything
[3047.60 - 3053.04] and so the industries want everybody
[3050.64 - 3055.36] guessing they want everybody confused
[3053.04 - 3057.76] and they want everybody to stay sick
[3055.36 - 3059.36] that's just the bottom line okay i have
[3057.76 - 3060.56] to be the one deliberate well that's the
[3059.36 - 3063.28] way it works you know
[3060.56 - 3065.44] i want to tell you read this new york
[3063.28 - 3068.08] times bestselling book deliver rescue
[3065.44 - 3069.20] learn about protein the whole bit
[3068.08 - 3070.96] protein myth
[3069.20 - 3072.64] critical critical to understand so you
[3070.96 - 3074.72] can protect yourselves so that's a good
[3072.64 - 3077.84] book you can actually uh get into
[3074.72 - 3079.20] if you're new to my books so let's move
[3077.84 - 3080.88] on down the line a little bit more i'm
[3079.20 - 3083.84] gonna sip a little bit of celery juice
[3080.88 - 3083.84] here
[3085.76 - 3090.32] okay so if you can't afford a book can't
[3087.92 - 3091.92] get a book go to the library
[3090.32 - 3093.52] get a book for free i don't care if
[3091.92 - 3095.84] everybody goes to the library
[3093.52 - 3097.36] back to hormones and eggs i don't care
[3095.84 - 3099.04] if the eggs organic free range you still
[3097.36 - 3100.72] have hormones that feed pathogens that
[3099.04 - 3101.76] keep you sick so your excellence rises
[3100.72 - 3102.80] are going to come and go it's going to
[3101.76 - 3104.56] keep on coming
[3102.80 - 3106.16] that's how it works doesn't matter if
[3104.56 - 3108.00] it's you know it's free range like i
[3106.16 - 3109.92] said the whole bit it still has hormones
[3108.00 - 3111.92] in it it's like a ball of hormones
[3109.92 - 3113.68] that's what it is naturally occurring
[3111.92 - 3115.36] and the hormones and eggs confuse the
[3113.68 - 3116.56] our endocrine endocrine glands our
[3115.36 - 3117.76] endocrine system so it's really
[3116.56 - 3119.84] important to understand
[3117.76 - 3121.60] and they also get stored up in her liver
[3119.84 - 3122.96] so the protein and eggs get stored up in
[3121.60 - 3124.64] our liver
[3122.96 - 3126.88] the the hormones from eggs get stored up
[3124.64 - 3127.44] in our liver and then we get sick
[3126.88 - 3129.28] because of
[3127.44 - 3130.64] pathogens sit inside the liver i talk
[3129.28 - 3132.64] about all the different viruses and
[3130.64 - 3135.52] pathogens that sit inside the liver
[3132.64 - 3136.48] and they feed off of a storage bin of
[3135.52 - 3138.40] old egg
[3136.48 - 3139.52] by-product that's sitting inside your
[3138.40 - 3140.88] liver so it's really important to
[3139.52 - 3143.12] understand
[3140.88 - 3144.64] eggs are not blood sugar balancers let's
[3143.12 - 3147.04] cover that a little bit everybody's like
[3144.64 - 3148.56] oh eggs will balance my blood sugar
[3147.04 - 3150.40] eggs will actually keep my blood sugar
[3148.56 - 3152.24] balance they keep me level first of all
[3150.40 - 3154.40] eggs have sugar in them
[3152.24 - 3156.64] so it's not just this protein food
[3154.40 - 3158.40] non-carb food that's not at all eggs
[3156.64 - 3160.72] actually have a lot of sugar in them
[3158.40 - 3162.88] there's a reason for that without sugar
[3160.72 - 3165.12] glucose a baby chicken can't form
[3162.88 - 3166.32] get muscles can't break out of the shell
[3165.12 - 3170.80] there has to be sugar
[3166.32 - 3173.28] inside of an egg or a baby chick
[3170.80 - 3174.96] can't develop and break out of the shell
[3173.28 - 3176.16] can't have the strength to break out of
[3174.96 - 3179.68] the shell
[3176.16 - 3181.92] so there has to be sugar in there
[3179.68 - 3183.76] i mean there is but if you take the
[3181.92 - 3185.60] the sugar naturally didn't have any if
[3183.76 - 3187.36] the egg didn't have naturally any sugar
[3185.60 - 3188.16] in it a baby chicken couldn't break out
[3187.36 - 3190.40] of the shell
[3188.16 - 3192.56] so that's how it works so when you have
[3190.40 - 3194.96] sugar and fat combined
[3192.56 - 3196.88] you have now you destable you're
[3194.96 - 3198.40] actually you disable your blood sugar
[3196.88 - 3199.84] that's how you create insulin resistance
[3198.40 - 3202.16] so just know this this is actually
[3199.84 - 3204.32] something is really important so
[3202.16 - 3205.52] eggs are toted as blood sugar imbalances
[3204.32 - 3206.96] they're good for diabetics they're good
[3205.52 - 3208.32] for people with diabetes and all that
[3206.96 - 3210.48] not true
[3208.32 - 3212.32] worst thing for diabetics the worst
[3210.48 - 3213.68] thing to keep you with diabetes you
[3212.32 - 3216.24] continue to stay with diet
[3213.68 - 3217.12] being a diabetic or a pre-diabetic or
[3216.24 - 3219.36] your a1c
[3217.12 - 3221.20] is going to constantly be unstable and
[3219.36 - 3224.00] you're going to have to need medications
[3221.20 - 3224.80] and the reason why is because this is
[3224.00 - 3227.04] sugar
[3224.80 - 3228.72] and protein this is sugar and fat
[3227.04 - 3231.12] combined inside of an egg
[3228.72 - 3233.36] it causes instant insulin resistance so
[3231.12 - 3235.12] it's not a blood sugar balancer
[3233.36 - 3236.64] because when you put fat and sugar
[3235.12 - 3238.88] together
[3236.64 - 3241.12] the sugar can't find its way into cells
[3238.88 - 3243.20] because fats blocking it so insulin has
[3241.12 - 3245.20] to be produced to try to somehow get
[3243.20 - 3246.56] that sugar to bypass the fat and enter
[3245.20 - 3247.28] into cells so you can actually have
[3246.56 - 3249.76] strength
[3247.28 - 3251.20] and that's how it works so these are bad
[3249.76 - 3252.72] for diabetics but yeah
[3251.20 - 3254.24] diabetics are told to eat them
[3252.72 - 3256.48] everybody's told to eat them that's the
[3254.24 - 3260.08] whole point we're all told to eat them
[3256.48 - 3261.76] so the fat clogs up the blood
[3260.08 - 3263.36] keeps the insulin from attaching to the
[3261.76 - 3265.44] sugar and then the
[3263.36 - 3267.20] sugar the glucose entering your cells
[3265.44 - 3269.84] that's how it works
[3267.20 - 3271.52] so when people are eating carbs if
[3269.84 - 3272.24] you're eating carbs with some type of
[3271.52 - 3274.56] fat
[3272.24 - 3275.28] the same thing occurs that's how it
[3274.56 - 3276.32] works so
[3275.28 - 3278.64] like for instance if you're eating
[3276.32 - 3281.20] french fries with oil
[3278.64 - 3281.84] french fries with oil is fat and a carb
[3281.20 - 3283.68] right
[3281.84 - 3286.16] see so that's insulin resistance but if
[3283.68 - 3288.08] you're eating potatoes without oil
[3286.16 - 3289.52] that's how it works that's why donuts
[3288.08 - 3292.56] cakes cookies
[3289.52 - 3295.52] all that stuff is bad for you it's fat
[3292.56 - 3296.40] and carbs it's fat and sugar that's how
[3295.52 - 3298.00] it works
[3296.40 - 3299.52] so because of that you get the insulin
[3298.00 - 3301.04] resistance so i'm trying to give you a
[3299.52 - 3302.80] little run down on that same thing with
[3301.04 - 3304.08] barbecue sauce so if you're actually got
[3302.80 - 3306.56] barbecue ribs
[3304.08 - 3308.08] going on the grill and you think you got
[3306.56 - 3310.40] a protein source right there but you
[3308.08 - 3311.60] slap on barbecue sauce you just put a
[3310.40 - 3313.52] sugar
[3311.60 - 3315.04] on top your barbecue ribs whatever
[3313.52 - 3316.72] you're on your ribs you put a sugar on
[3315.04 - 3318.48] top of it you just cause an insulin
[3316.72 - 3322.16] resistant issue with sugar
[3318.48 - 3324.96] and fat very important understand so
[3322.16 - 3326.32] realize this is not free from that it's
[3324.96 - 3328.64] got a lot of sugar in it
[3326.32 - 3329.68] to keep a baby chicken actually so baby
[3328.64 - 3331.44] chicken can grow
[3329.68 - 3333.28] it can gain muscle and strength and be
[3331.44 - 3335.28] able to break out of the shell
[3333.28 - 3337.36] and that's how it works so eggs are not
[3335.28 - 3338.48] a perfect food for diabetes that's the
[3337.36 - 3341.68] whole point
[3338.48 - 3343.36] so you can you can read more information
[3341.68 - 3344.16] about this too in my books i talk all
[3343.36 - 3346.08] about that
[3344.16 - 3347.60] liver rescue is a great one for get your
[3346.08 - 3349.12] liver healthy and actually you can get
[3347.60 - 3350.88] so many conditions behind you it's
[3349.12 - 3352.96] ridiculous you can actually really heal
[3350.88 - 3354.64] you can learn how to heal the whole bit
[3352.96 - 3356.72] um and you know what i'm going to be
[3354.64 - 3359.12] doing a keto live ketogenic live
[3356.72 - 3360.56] diet you know ketogenic diet live too so
[3359.12 - 3362.16] we're going to do that eventually i
[3360.56 - 3363.68] can't wait to do that cover all of that
[3362.16 - 3366.88] that's going to be fun
[3363.68 - 3367.92] um so here's the other thing people have
[3366.88 - 3371.28] to understand too
[3367.92 - 3371.92] okay eggs are high in fat so remember
[3371.28 - 3373.44] that too
[3371.92 - 3374.80] so it's a whole nother thing so they're
[3373.44 - 3376.48] high in fat so when you put the sugar
[3374.80 - 3377.68] combination of fat and sugar that's when
[3376.48 - 3379.44] you get the problems
[3377.68 - 3381.36] that's the bottom line and then the
[3379.44 - 3383.92] person feels stabilized but
[3381.36 - 3385.36] really they become destabilized more and
[3383.92 - 3387.68] more and more and more
[3385.36 - 3389.20] and they end up getting in trouble so
[3387.68 - 3390.64] and the reason why they feel stabilized
[3389.20 - 3392.16] for the moment by eating eggs some
[3390.64 - 3393.28] people feel stabilized because it's got
[3392.16 - 3394.96] a lot of calories
[3393.28 - 3396.64] it's got a it's got it's packed with
[3394.96 - 3397.92] calories it's the bottom line so
[3396.64 - 3399.20] if you're going to eat a caloric foods
[3397.92 - 3400.80] you're going to feel stable for a little
[3399.20 - 3402.16] while so anytime but
[3400.80 - 3403.36] you're going to set yourself up for
[3402.16 - 3404.80] pre-diabetes you're going to set
[3403.36 - 3406.80] yourself down the road for liver
[3404.80 - 3408.80] problems because eggs clog up the liver
[3406.80 - 3410.32] cause pre-diabetes and so forth and
[3408.80 - 3412.00] that's one of the things that gets us in
[3410.32 - 3413.60] trouble down the road
[3412.00 - 3415.44] um so that's something i wanted to cover
[3413.60 - 3417.36] there many people eat their eggs fried
[3415.44 - 3418.88] or in omelets butter or oil the whole
[3417.36 - 3420.48] bit now here's something i got to talk
[3418.88 - 3423.60] about this is fun just let me get a sip
[3420.48 - 3423.60] of celery juice right here
[3424.88 - 3429.44] so coconut oil let's talk about coconut
[3427.20 - 3430.88] oil and eggs
[3429.44 - 3432.88] just because you're frying your eggs and
[3430.88 - 3434.56] coconut oil
[3432.88 - 3436.08] that's not the answer that's not the
[3434.56 - 3437.76] answer because you're still
[3436.08 - 3439.12] feeding any kind of pathogen any kind of
[3437.76 - 3440.32] virus any kind of bacteria that's in
[3439.12 - 3441.12] your body that's causing any of your
[3440.32 - 3442.56] symptoms
[3441.12 - 3444.08] you're still feeding any illness you're
[3442.56 - 3445.20] still feeding any disease so what
[3444.08 - 3447.60] happens is if you take
[3445.20 - 3449.68] take eggs and you fry in coconut oil or
[3447.60 - 3451.36] you cook it in coconut oil
[3449.68 - 3452.88] it's a way a term i call bullshitting
[3451.36 - 3453.52] yourself that's what it does you know
[3452.88 - 3455.44] it's like
[3453.52 - 3457.12] you think it's healthier you think we're
[3455.44 - 3458.72] told it's healthier all you're doing is
[3457.12 - 3460.96] adding more fat to your meal
[3458.72 - 3462.40] so you're having like a double fat meal
[3460.96 - 3463.92] eggs which have fat in it then you're
[3462.40 - 3466.16] adding coconut oil
[3463.92 - 3467.52] into it and you're using that sure it's
[3466.16 - 3469.20] better than using butter
[3467.52 - 3471.04] definitely it's without a doubt it's
[3469.20 - 3473.44] better using butter or bacon grease
[3471.04 - 3475.04] without a doubt it is so i like that's
[3473.44 - 3476.64] what i like about the coconut oil with
[3475.04 - 3477.84] eggs and stuff but at the same time
[3476.64 - 3479.04] you're not getting away with something
[3477.84 - 3480.72] the most important part
[3479.04 - 3482.16] which is this is responsible for all
[3480.72 - 3483.36] those diagnoses
[3482.16 - 3486.88] this is one of the things that are
[3483.36 - 3489.44] responsible for feeding the viruses
[3486.88 - 3490.88] and the bugs that are responsible for
[3489.44 - 3492.16] autoimmune conditions and all different
[3490.88 - 3493.60] conditions that are out there and
[3492.16 - 3495.20] diseases and so forth
[3493.60 - 3498.24] all the pathogens of viruses and
[3495.20 - 3500.08] bacteria that feed off of foods it likes
[3498.24 - 3501.68] this is one of those foods that's what
[3500.08 - 3504.00] i'm saying this was a food that
[3501.68 - 3505.68] raised them in the labs and they're in
[3504.00 - 3507.04] our system and they're in our bodies and
[3505.68 - 3509.12] then that's what everybody's
[3507.04 - 3510.48] that's what everybody's fighting they're
[3509.12 - 3512.56] fighting their
[3510.48 - 3514.32] pathogens and they're fighting also the
[3512.56 - 3515.36] information out there the misinformation
[3514.32 - 3516.56] out there at the same time they're
[3515.36 - 3518.40] finding two things
[3516.56 - 3519.60] and i always say if you know the truth
[3518.40 - 3520.24] you don't have to fight one thing
[3519.60 - 3523.28] anymore
[3520.24 - 3525.52] all the misinformation and all
[3523.28 - 3527.52] of the the the information that's out
[3525.52 - 3528.72] there that isn't right that doesn't work
[3527.52 - 3530.32] that isn't good
[3528.72 - 3532.16] and you don't have to fight that battle
[3530.32 - 3533.84] anymore so once you have the real
[3532.16 - 3535.44] information of what causes illness and
[3533.84 - 3536.56] you know how to support yourself and you
[3535.44 - 3538.96] know how to
[3536.56 - 3540.24] empower yourself and heal that's one
[3538.96 - 3542.64] battle that's over
[3540.24 - 3544.64] the next battle is clean up your system
[3542.64 - 3546.24] clean up the toxins clean up the bugs
[3544.64 - 3548.24] and the whole bit it's so important to
[3546.24 - 3550.00] that so
[3548.24 - 3551.36] you gotta re-watch this live anybody who
[3550.00 - 3552.48] came on now you have to go back to the
[3551.36 - 3553.84] beginning of this live and make sure you
[3552.48 - 3555.52] watch it right from the beginning to all
[3553.84 - 3558.56] of it it's so important
[3555.52 - 3559.92] no one is immune from getting sick
[3558.56 - 3562.16] and no one's immune from bullshitting
[3559.92 - 3563.92] themselves when it comes down to eggs
[3562.16 - 3566.08] in order to support somebody's belief
[3563.92 - 3568.32] system and they love eggs
[3566.08 - 3570.32] they will themselves in every
[3568.32 - 3572.48] possible shape and manner
[3570.32 - 3573.68] because if you love the emotional
[3572.48 - 3575.52] connection you have with
[3573.68 - 3577.36] eggs and you're really connected and you
[3575.52 - 3578.96] love the taste and you hear one good
[3577.36 - 3580.80] thing about eggs out there
[3578.96 - 3582.08] without fail you're going to pass it on
[3580.80 - 3583.60] to the next generation you're going to
[3582.08 - 3584.96] pass it on to the next generation and
[3583.60 - 3585.60] pass it on to the next generation and
[3584.96 - 3587.44] you're
[3585.60 - 3589.68] and it's going to happen over and over
[3587.44 - 3591.36] and over again you'll carry the torch
[3589.68 - 3593.04] into the next generation is what you'll
[3591.36 - 3594.96] do because
[3593.04 - 3596.40] no one wants to drop a belief system
[3594.96 - 3598.72] that tastes good
[3596.40 - 3600.40] and everybody's eating it's their
[3598.72 - 3601.92] favorite comfort food or one of their
[3600.40 - 3603.52] favorite comfort foods i've had people
[3601.92 - 3604.72] tell me no eggs not my favorite comfort
[3603.52 - 3606.08] food but they can't get rid of them and
[3604.72 - 3608.24] they can't stop eating them
[3606.08 - 3609.44] because it is i've had so many people
[3608.24 - 3610.64] say well i don't really eat that many
[3609.44 - 3612.24] eggs
[3610.64 - 3613.76] maybe you're one of them and you're like
[3612.24 - 3615.12] hey you know anthony
[3613.76 - 3616.64] i don't really eat that many eggs i
[3615.12 - 3617.36] think you're kind of like off in this
[3616.64 - 3619.36] one
[3617.36 - 3621.04] but then get rid of them get rid of them
[3619.36 - 3622.56] and keep them out all together
[3621.04 - 3624.40] keep them out all together and get rid
[3622.56 - 3624.72] of them and you'll know where you stand
[3624.40 - 3626.72] with
[3624.72 - 3628.56] it you'll know you know if you're
[3626.72 - 3630.16] someone who's going if you're someone
[3628.56 - 3632.56] who is going to watch this
[3630.16 - 3634.40] live and you're going to hop on the
[3632.56 - 3635.04] research and science bandwagon of
[3634.40 - 3637.20] researching
[3635.04 - 3638.80] sites about supporting your comfort food
[3637.20 - 3639.92] about supporting eggs about if you're
[3638.80 - 3641.20] someone watching this right now and
[3639.92 - 3642.48] you're like wait a minute i got to go on
[3641.20 - 3643.52] the internet now i got to look up
[3642.48 - 3645.44] studies and research
[3643.52 - 3646.96] i got to look up things and and find out
[3645.44 - 3647.92] how eggs are good for me and find out
[3646.96 - 3651.20] how eggs are
[3647.92 - 3652.08] you know realize that egg studies are
[3651.20 - 3654.80] paid for
[3652.08 - 3656.48] by their constituents they're paid for
[3654.80 - 3659.28] that's how it works
[3656.48 - 3660.72] that's how it's done nobody's paying me
[3659.28 - 3662.40] to do this
[3660.72 - 3663.84] nobody's paying me to do this to put it
[3662.40 - 3667.12] simple
[3663.84 - 3668.48] to put it simple okay because it's the
[3667.12 - 3670.08] first thing that people are going to do
[3668.48 - 3671.20] after seeing this this youtube
[3670.08 - 3672.48] is they're going to be running looking
[3671.20 - 3673.60] for research about eggs they're going to
[3672.48 - 3675.84] say wait a minute where
[3673.60 - 3677.52] how does eggs work how are they bad and
[3675.84 - 3679.36] they're going to trust studies
[3677.52 - 3682.72] that are paid for so you keep eating
[3679.36 - 3684.40] eggs but that's how the world works
[3682.72 - 3686.08] haven't you figured that out yet you
[3684.40 - 3686.88] know it's pretty much just how the world
[3686.08 - 3689.68] works with stuff
[3686.88 - 3691.20] that's how crazy the world is because
[3689.68 - 3693.12] it's all about keeping you sick
[3691.20 - 3694.48] keeping the industry fat the fat cats
[3693.12 - 3696.08] happy out there
[3694.48 - 3698.16] keeping them nice and you know all the
[3696.08 - 3699.52] money paid for all the investors all the
[3698.16 - 3700.88] backups all that stuff
[3699.52 - 3702.16] all that constituents happy and
[3700.88 - 3703.28] everything they're going to make sure
[3702.16 - 3706.08] those studies
[3703.28 - 3707.28] are supporting eggs and that's the
[3706.08 - 3708.08] bottom line it's going to get pushed
[3707.28 - 3709.44] into the
[3708.08 - 3710.80] alternative movement it's going to get
[3709.44 - 3713.36] pushed in every movement it's going to
[3710.80 - 3715.52] be in every diet system there is
[3713.36 - 3717.12] except for the vegan system but yet the
[3715.52 - 3718.96] vegans flip flop anyway and they leave
[3717.12 - 3720.72] veganism and veganism the minute they
[3718.96 - 3721.92] get a sniffle because their people are
[3720.72 - 3724.08] telling them they need protein or
[3721.92 - 3725.92] something so they run off and they're
[3724.08 - 3727.36] now they're eating eggs again which is
[3725.92 - 3728.96] you know which is sad because i like
[3727.36 - 3730.48] anybody who's just staying off of eggs
[3728.96 - 3732.00] no matter what diet belief system
[3730.48 - 3734.08] they're attached to or whatever they're
[3732.00 - 3737.12] attached to
[3734.08 - 3739.04] the industry big pharma actually pushed
[3737.12 - 3742.64] eggs upon us
[3739.04 - 3745.44] they use them in the labs to get us sick
[3742.64 - 3747.28] and they push it upon us to eat them
[3745.44 - 3751.60] that's how it's done
[3747.28 - 3753.84] and they know this they know this okay
[3751.60 - 3755.68] i want you to know this and remember if
[3753.84 - 3757.52] you like i said if you're a big science
[3755.68 - 3760.64] research study fan
[3757.52 - 3762.48] just know you know if they if science of
[3760.64 - 3766.64] research had all the answers
[3762.48 - 3768.72] why is everybody so darn sick
[3766.64 - 3770.16] so many symptoms and conditions
[3768.72 - 3774.56] conditions that are just
[3770.16 - 3775.68] rising out of the blue over 250 million
[3774.56 - 3777.20] americans alone
[3775.68 - 3779.36] have symptoms and conditions they can't
[3777.20 - 3780.24] get rid of so is that what it's supposed
[3779.36 - 3782.08] to be you guys
[3780.24 - 3783.76] are we all supposed to be sick is
[3782.08 - 3786.16] everybody supposed to be sick except for
[3783.76 - 3788.40] a few 20 year olds before they get sick
[3786.16 - 3789.60] i mean is that how it's supposed to be
[3788.40 - 3791.84] millions
[3789.60 - 3792.80] and the millions getting sicker that are
[3791.84 - 3794.72] coming
[3792.80 - 3796.00] soon the millions that are going to get
[3794.72 - 3798.16] sicker why are you
[3796.00 - 3799.20] or someone you know why are you or
[3798.16 - 3801.12] someone you know
[3799.20 - 3804.08] still suffering with x-men psoriasis if
[3801.12 - 3807.28] research and science had all the answers
[3804.08 - 3809.04] why i mean do they go to enough doctors
[3807.28 - 3810.64] don't don't they have all the answers oh
[3809.04 - 3812.80] i forgot their body's attacking itself
[3810.64 - 3815.60] that's right the 1950s theory
[3812.80 - 3816.80] that was shoved in everybody's face so
[3815.60 - 3818.40] realize
[3816.80 - 3819.84] how research in science works with
[3818.40 - 3822.64] chronic illness and how it's a
[3819.84 - 3825.12] it's a house of cards and it just falls
[3822.64 - 3826.88] and breaks and falls all falls down
[3825.12 - 3828.32] you have to be able to see that or you
[3826.88 - 3829.28] can't heal in the end
[3828.32 - 3830.48] because you'll just be playing the
[3829.28 - 3831.76] guessing games and you'll be running
[3830.48 - 3832.88] around you'll be eating eggs then you'll
[3831.76 - 3834.16] be on this diet then you'll be doing

[3867.76 - 3872.64] correct is critical
[3869.68 - 3875.28] eggs are not the culprit for disease i'm
[3872.64 - 3877.68] not saying eggs are responsible
[3875.28 - 3878.80] i'm not saying don't make listen don't
[3877.68 - 3881.60] mistake this
[3878.80 - 3883.36] i'm not attacking eggs and saying
[3881.60 - 3885.20] they're actually the culprit of disease
[3883.36 - 3886.88] it takes a host of toxic heavy metals
[3885.20 - 3888.48] mercury aluminum copper it takes
[3886.88 - 3889.52] pathogens takes viruses such as
[3888.48 - 3893.20] epstein-barr
[3889.52 - 3894.00] it takes all of that and that's that's
[3893.20 - 3897.12] what it's involved
[3894.00 - 3900.64] with it just so happens that the eggs
[3897.12 - 3902.96] feed pathogens the egg actually feeds
[3900.64 - 3904.24] the viruses the viruses eat the eggs is
[3902.96 - 3906.24] what happens
[3904.24 - 3909.20] i know it's pretty silly right but it's
[3906.24 - 3911.52] the truth and it is the bottom line
[3909.20 - 3912.80] eggs aren't the cause of disease but
[3911.52 - 3914.48] they feed it
[3912.80 - 3916.00] so eggs aren't the cause of disease but
[3914.48 - 3917.92] they feed it so important to understand
[3916.00 - 3920.16] you guys that's like critical they feed
[3917.92 - 3922.48] basically that's how it works because
[3920.16 - 3924.08] the viruses that cause disease were fed
[3922.48 - 3927.84] eggs
[3924.08 - 3930.88] look here's the thing
[3927.84 - 3931.84] okay i want you guys to have the answer
[3930.88 - 3933.12] answers i want you to have the
[3931.84 - 3934.88] information i want you to know you can
[3933.12 - 3937.36] heal avoid eggs at all
[3934.88 - 3939.12] costs is what i'm trying to say if
[3937.36 - 3940.56] you're not sick now and you feel good
[3939.12 - 3943.04] and you want to eat some eggs
[3940.56 - 3943.76] okay fine i mean eat some eggs but we're
[3943.04 - 3947.20] always one
[3943.76 - 3949.52] egg away from getting ourselves sicker
[3947.20 - 3950.40] so important to know look it sounds
[3949.52 - 3952.48] ridiculous
[3950.40 - 3954.00] probably to someone who's not feeling
[3952.48 - 3955.28] too many symptoms or any symptoms at all
[3954.00 - 3956.40] and they're like that egg didn't hurt me
[3955.28 - 3959.20] when i hated
[3956.40 - 3960.72] but what about the woman with pcos who's
[3959.20 - 3962.56] really suffering with some kind of
[3960.72 - 3964.72] reproductive system condition or the
[3962.56 - 3966.56] worst endometriosis she's getting she's
[3964.72 - 3968.72] getting surgery
[3966.56 - 3970.72] and there she's told to eat an egg every
[3968.72 - 3974.16] day and it's worsening the condition
[3970.72 - 3974.72] rapidly or even a diabetic that's being
[3974.16 - 3976.16] told
[3974.72 - 3977.52] you might care about the diabetic in
[3976.16 - 3979.28] your family and they're told to eat eggs
[3977.52 - 3980.80] every day
[3979.28 - 3982.40] basically the bottom line is have
[3980.80 - 3984.16] compassion for the people
[3982.40 - 3985.44] people who actually really are sick
[3984.16 - 3987.12] struggling and going through hell and
[3985.44 - 3988.40] back or bend through hell and back
[3987.12 - 3990.96] and i want you guys to have that
[3988.40 - 3992.48] compassion for them too because
[3990.96 - 3994.00] but by having that compassion you'll
[3992.48 - 3995.36] actually be more open to understanding
[3994.00 - 3996.88] this information
[3995.36 - 3998.80] and and about the eggs and what i'm
[3996.88 - 4000.56] talking about in the whole bit
[3998.80 - 4002.00] what about the people who are 102 years
[4000.56 - 4003.28] old what are the people who are 90 years
[4002.00 - 4004.64] old and ate eggs their whole life they
[4003.28 - 4006.32] didn't have the pathogens we're up
[4004.64 - 4007.68] against now we're up against mutations
[4006.32 - 4009.28] that are different we're up against over
[4007.68 - 4011.12] 60 varieties of epstein-barr not one
[4009.28 - 4012.80] variety of epstein-barr we're up against
[4011.12 - 4014.32] toxic heavy metals like never before in
[4012.80 - 4015.92] history we're up against mercury like
[4014.32 - 4017.28] never before in history so you need to
[4015.92 - 4018.64] know that we're up against all these
[4017.28 - 4019.92] different toxins and all these different
[4018.64 - 4022.00] poisons and we're up against things
[4019.92 - 4024.24] we've never been up against
[4022.00 - 4027.04] and and people that the the last
[4024.24 - 4029.20] dinosaurs that are 102 102 years old
[4027.04 - 4031.36] that are 99 years old and 98 years old
[4029.20 - 4033.52] god bless them the last dinosaurs
[4031.36 - 4034.96] have less of that in their system they
[4033.52 - 4036.96] got less of that and they were exposed
[4034.96 - 4038.48] to less pathogens but that changed
[4036.96 - 4040.64] that all changed why do you think we
[4038.48 - 4043.04] have teenagers that are laying in bed
[4040.64 - 4043.76] suffering with like full body pain and
[4043.04 - 4045.52] fatigue
[4043.76 - 4047.20] why do you think there's there's there's
[4045.52 - 4048.64] children that are sick to the degree
[4047.20 - 4051.04] they are and getting diagnosed with
[4048.64 - 4052.56] autoimmune every every minute why do you
[4051.04 - 4054.08] think there's people in their early 20s
[4052.56 - 4055.60] that can't go to college anymore or
[4054.08 - 4056.72] can't pursue their career after college
[4055.60 - 4058.24] or can't do anything
[4056.72 - 4060.24] why do you think there's people like
[4058.24 - 4061.36] literally suffering why do you think
[4060.24 - 4063.04] everybody's getting diagnosed with a
[4061.36 - 4066.24] thyroid condition
[4063.04 - 4068.08] that never happened back then that never
[4066.24 - 4069.36] happened with the old days of what
[4068.08 - 4072.64] happened
[4069.36 - 4074.40] so and look even if you raise your own
[4072.64 - 4075.92] chickens have your own chickens
[4074.40 - 4078.40] have the best chickens in the world that
[4075.92 - 4080.00] egg will still feed bugs
[4078.40 - 4081.60] bottom line you can still keep your
[4080.00 - 4083.36] chickens if it's therapy you can still
[4081.60 - 4085.60] keep your chickens and feed them and
[4083.36 - 4086.80] have them lay eggs and and maybe there's
[4085.60 - 4088.24] somebody that doesn't care about this
[4086.80 - 4089.60] information you can give the eggs to
[4088.24 - 4090.80] because they want to eat the eggs no
[4089.60 - 4092.56] matter what and they don't care about
[4090.80 - 4093.36] this information she could find somebody
[4092.56 - 4094.88] but
[4093.36 - 4096.80] the point is even if you raise your own
[4094.88 - 4098.88] chickens just the eggs will feed
[4096.80 - 4100.32] if you're con look i've known people
[4098.88 - 4100.96] over the years raising their own
[4100.32 - 4103.92] chickens
[4100.96 - 4104.40] the most amazing eggs dark dark colored
[4103.92 - 4107.76] yolks
[4104.40 - 4110.64] like incredible dark orange yellow yolks
[4107.76 - 4111.84] like incredible and but they're
[4110.64 - 4113.84] suffering with like
[4111.84 - 4115.12] fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis
[4113.84 - 4116.72] and they got all the joint pain and
[4115.12 - 4118.48] their back creaks and hurts and they
[4116.72 - 4120.48] they go out to the chicken to the
[4118.48 - 4122.08] chicken shack and they're
[4120.48 - 4123.52] and they're you know and they're they're
[4122.08 - 4124.88] out there and they're they're collecting
[4123.52 - 4126.08] their eggs but they're
[4124.88 - 4128.08] they got all kinds of problems and they
[4126.08 - 4128.96] got glaucoma developing and they got all
[4128.08 - 4130.32] kinds of different
[4128.96 - 4131.92] symptoms and they're they're in their
[4130.32 - 4134.00] 50s but they're like they're they're
[4131.92 - 4135.12] feeling like they're 85-90 they feel
[4134.00 - 4138.72] like they're a hundred
[4135.12 - 4142.00] no don't eat the eggs don't eat the eggs
[4138.72 - 4142.88] and what about you know look be mad at
[4142.00 - 4146.32] the industry
[4142.88 - 4149.76] that raised the bugs and pathogens
[4146.32 - 4152.48] with your food that was a good food
[4149.76 - 4154.40] that was a great food that's the irony
[4152.48 - 4157.12] see i think eggs
[4154.40 - 4158.32] was an amazing food you know back in the
[4157.12 - 4160.80] old days
[4158.32 - 4163.20] it wasn't the most nutrient-rich food
[4160.80 - 4164.72] but it was a survival food that's why i
[4163.20 - 4166.00] think it was an amazing food because
[4164.72 - 4167.84] back in the old days
[4166.00 - 4169.44] it was an incredible survival food when
[4167.84 - 4170.72] nothing else was around in the moment if
[4169.44 - 4172.72] you can get an egg
[4170.72 - 4174.40] it was a really good high caloric
[4172.72 - 4176.00] survival food that's why
[4174.40 - 4177.44] that's i mean that's why i even like
[4176.00 - 4179.44] eggs in that sense it's
[4177.44 - 4180.56] it has a history of that but it's
[4179.44 - 4182.32] changed
[4180.56 - 4184.00] you know be mad at the industry for
[4182.32 - 4185.60] taking those eggs and ruining them be
[4184.00 - 4187.20] mad at the industry don't be mad at me
[4185.60 - 4188.00] for dropping the news on you'd be mad at
[4187.20 - 4189.76] the industry for what
[4188.00 - 4191.28] they've done to eggs that's really
[4189.76 - 4193.84] important to know
[4191.28 - 4195.60] you know so what about the people who
[4193.84 - 4197.20] can say i'm taking away everything they
[4195.60 - 4198.64] can eat so what about those people
[4197.20 - 4200.48] that's a good question because
[4198.64 - 4203.28] you know that's a question i i hear all
[4200.48 - 4204.56] the time is oh you know medical medium
[4203.28 - 4205.76] you're you want everybody on celery
[4204.56 - 4206.56] juice and you're taking away everything
[4205.76 - 4208.56] they eat
[4206.56 - 4210.24] that's not true medical medium
[4208.56 - 4211.60] information in all the books gives you
[4210.24 - 4213.20] the most food to eat than any of the
[4211.60 - 4214.64] diet systems out there what about
[4213.20 - 4216.72] what about when you go and get your food
[4214.64 - 4217.44] allergy food sensitivity testing and
[4216.72 - 4220.32] take away
[4217.44 - 4222.24] 30 fruits and vegetables and herbs away
[4220.32 - 4224.08] from you're not even allowed anything
[4222.24 - 4225.68] what about that i mean what about all
[4224.08 - 4227.60] the diet belief systems out there that
[4225.68 - 4229.20] all these years that strip people of all
[4227.60 - 4230.24] eliminate all the foods elimination
[4229.20 - 4231.52] plans
[4230.24 - 4232.96] and they get rid of your fruit what
[4231.52 - 4234.48] about all the diet systems what about
[4232.96 - 4235.84] all the diet belief systems that get rid
[4234.48 - 4237.04] of your fruit including the vegan
[4235.84 - 4239.12] systems now out there they get rid of
[4237.04 - 4242.64] your fruits and your nightshades
[4239.12 - 4244.08] i'm the only guy out there the only the
[4242.64 - 4246.56] only books and information
[4244.08 - 4248.40] and give you more things to eat than any
[4246.56 - 4250.24] of the other diet belief systems
[4248.40 - 4251.92] so if anybody thinks i'm the food police
[4250.24 - 4253.68] quite the opposite it's just that the
[4251.92 - 4255.28] difference is i know what foods to avoid
[4253.68 - 4258.32] because i know what causes illness
[4255.28 - 4259.76] i want you to know that okay so the
[4258.32 - 4261.68] medical medium information the book
[4259.76 - 4263.60] series the medical books
[4261.68 - 4264.88] it's all about knowing what to avoid so
[4263.60 - 4265.60] you don't feed the bugs and the
[4264.88 - 4268.40] pathogens
[4265.60 - 4270.08] that's what it's all about and i only
[4268.40 - 4271.20] tell you that what foods feed those
[4270.08 - 4273.68] pathogens
[4271.20 - 4275.20] and to not be fooled okay and don't be
[4273.68 - 4276.72] fooled when you see young people because
[4275.20 - 4278.80] it's confusing i get it
[4276.72 - 4280.24] when you see them you know young people
[4278.80 - 4280.56] they're seemed indestructible and
[4280.24 - 4282.08] they're
[4280.56 - 4284.24] and they're they're in the gym and
[4282.08 - 4285.68] they're they're removing gluten and
[4284.24 - 4286.88] removing some bad stuff out of their
[4285.68 - 4288.40] diets and they're choosing
[4286.88 - 4289.92] choosing to do egg whites and they're
[4288.40 - 4291.84] cooking their eggs in coconut oil
[4289.92 - 4294.24] and they're exercising they seem symptom
[4291.84 - 4296.56] free it's a short
[4294.24 - 4298.00] short duration of time it's a short
[4296.56 - 4300.24] duration of time
[4298.00 - 4302.48] because they may seem indestructible but
[4300.24 - 4304.80] i've been in this for 35 years
[4302.48 - 4306.32] and i and i talk to doctors all the time
[4304.80 - 4308.88] and it's like no one's
[4306.32 - 4309.44] no one's getting away with it bottom
[4308.88 - 4311.52] line
[4309.44 - 4313.28] that's what i'm trying to say and when
[4311.52 - 4314.24] and when it does hurt you later i
[4313.28 - 4316.16] guarantee you
[4314.24 - 4318.24] one something something that when you're
[4316.16 - 4319.04] young and you're exercising and you're
[4318.24 - 4320.56] doing your thing
[4319.04 - 4322.16] and you believe if you believe in what
[4320.56 - 4323.76] you're doing and you're you're eating
[4322.16 - 4325.12] pretty good and all of that and you
[4323.76 - 4325.84] think you're indestructible and when
[4325.12 - 4327.36] something happens
[4325.84 - 4329.36] you start getting symptoms like you will
[4327.36 - 4330.80] because everybody does
[4329.36 - 4332.80] i'm gonna tell you right now you're
[4330.80 - 4335.04] never gonna blame the egg
[4332.80 - 4336.72] you're never gonna blame the egg you
[4335.04 - 4342.56] won't be blaming that
[4336.72 - 4345.84] but that you'll never blame the egg
[4342.56 - 4347.84] bottom line so it's important to know
[4345.84 - 4349.28] you know you'll blame a piece of fruit
[4347.84 - 4350.40] you'll blame something else but you
[4349.28 - 4352.40] won't blame the egg
[4350.40 - 4353.60] so look i have nothing to gain like i
[4352.40 - 4355.76] said about any of this
[4353.60 - 4357.28] it's just about you healing so if i call
[4355.76 - 4359.04] that some of the gain then
[4357.28 - 4362.08] yeah i call that something to gain you
[4359.04 - 4365.04] healing it's called you healing
[4362.08 - 4365.60] being empowered and not disempowered so
[4365.04 - 4367.12] a lot of
[4365.60 - 4368.88] there's a lot of women disempowerment
[4367.12 - 4369.28] going on with the medical industry still
[4368.88 - 4371.76] to
[4369.28 - 4373.36] to this day and everybody bought into it
[4371.76 - 4375.28] women being told it's their genes
[4373.36 - 4376.88] it's complete total disempowerment
[4375.28 - 4378.48] because that you walk around as a woman
[4376.88 - 4380.16] thinking your jeans are faulty
[4378.48 - 4382.08] and then they're garbage that's what
[4380.16 - 4383.28] they're teaching women right now
[4382.08 - 4384.80] they're teaching women that their body's
[4383.28 - 4386.08] attacking itself and it's their fault
[4384.80 - 4387.28] they're also teaching women that it's
[4386.08 - 4388.80] all in their head and they're creating
[4387.28 - 4391.68] it with their thoughts
[4388.80 - 4392.32] so that's another thing too okay you buy
[4391.68 - 4394.72] into that
[4392.32 - 4395.92] you just buy into their tricks and games
[4394.72 - 4399.12] of disempowerment
[4395.92 - 4402.80] of body shaming so remember that too
[4399.12 - 4405.20] eggs are a catapult basically
[4402.80 - 4406.72] they're a catapult of getting people
[4405.20 - 4409.04] sick
[4406.72 - 4410.40] here's how it works women are world
[4409.04 - 4412.96] changers
[4410.40 - 4413.76] they change the world the industries
[4412.96 - 4415.28] know this
[4413.76 - 4417.12] though in these industries have been
[4415.28 - 4420.16] trying to keep women down
[4417.12 - 4423.04] for decades and decades and decades
[4420.16 - 4424.08] because women change the world for the
[4423.04 - 4426.64] positive
[4424.08 - 4427.60] okay they make things happen that's what
[4426.64 - 4430.56] they do
[4427.60 - 4432.56] okay we know that that's the bottom line
[4430.56 - 4434.16] so keeping women disempowered
[4432.56 - 4435.68] training them that their body's faulty
[4434.16 - 4437.36] their genes are faulty and their immune
[4435.68 - 4438.64] systems are attacking itself training
[4437.36 - 4440.32] them to eat eggs
[4438.64 - 4442.24] the very foods that feed viruses and
[4440.32 - 4443.44] pathogens training them that it's all in
[4442.24 - 4445.36] their head and they're creating it with
[4443.44 - 4448.56] some kind of like woo-woo
[4445.36 - 4450.08] training them that they're crazy or lazy
[4448.56 - 4451.52] or bored and that's why they're fatigued
[4450.08 - 4452.80] all these years so whatever it is that
[4451.52 - 4454.32] they're training them to do
[4452.80 - 4456.16] it's to keep them down keep them
[4454.32 - 4458.08] disempowered because they're world
[4456.16 - 4462.00] changers and that's the bottom line
[4458.08 - 4464.56] eggs feed every tumor cyst every fibroid
[4462.00 - 4466.08] every single cancer every single any
[4464.56 - 4468.88] kind of reproductive system
[4466.08 - 4471.20] eggs feed all of the very things women
[4468.88 - 4473.60] are afraid of and worried about
[4471.20 - 4474.64] that's what eggs feed okay so that just
[4473.60 - 4476.80] goes to show you right there
[4474.64 - 4478.40] endometriosis pcos eggs
[4476.80 - 4480.72] feed these it's so important to know
[4478.40 - 4483.92] this okay
[4480.72 - 4485.60] so they're told to eat eggs every
[4483.92 - 4486.96] morning they're told to eat eggs every
[4485.60 - 4488.00] morning it's almost like a joke played
[4486.96 - 4489.84] on everybody
[4488.00 - 4492.00] so women are told to eat eggs every day
[4489.84 - 4494.48] every morning to keep them sick
[4492.00 - 4495.92] and disempowered and then when they get
[4494.48 - 4497.20] the first hashimoto's thyroiditis
[4495.92 - 4499.12] diagnosis they're told that their body
[4497.20 - 4500.88] is destroying their own thyroid
[4499.12 - 4502.32] it really breaks the soul down in a
[4500.88 - 4503.84] woman and it breaks the soul down in
[4502.32 - 4505.76] people and it breaks them down
[4503.84 - 4507.20] it kicks them down a notch and it
[4505.76 - 4508.96] weakens them

[4508.96 - 4512.16] you can learn about the information you
[4510.56 - 4514.16] can learn about how to protect yourself
