about epstein-barr and why does that

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,240

147
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160

149
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,280
everybody was on the merry-go-round and

150
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,639
chasing phantom ghosts for answers like

151
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,560
chasing theories and chasing all that

152
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,800
guessing games everybody was running

153
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
around the musical chairs

154
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,400
and so millions of women around the

155
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,680
world and they're still doing it that

156
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560

158
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,160
they're doing the musical chair route

159
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,080
where they're like okay this doctor here

all the doctors thought that science of

191
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,240
research thought that

192
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
they just thought that you caught mono

193
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
and then

194
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,720
it disappeared and you were better and

195
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
you would never have to worry about

196
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,400
anything ever again

197
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,360
the whole reason anybody's talking about

198
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,440
reactivation of epstein-barr

199
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,880
right now today is because of the

200
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,840
original book here

201
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,639
and that's how incredible that is so now

202
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,680
out there

203
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,120
you'll hear out there reactivation of

204
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
epstein-barr

205
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,840
and you'll hear that and that's from

206
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,919
this book no one in science or research

207
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,039
no one anywhere no doctors knew

208
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,240
epstein-barr

209
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:04,560
caused an aftermath problems

210
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,599
later on which lead to lyme disease

211
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,680
so this book brought that truth

212
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,840
to light and the thing is

213
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,120
is that epstein-barr causes symptoms

214
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
later on

215
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
so you get your mono whether you know

216
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,800
it's mono or not

217
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,240
or if it was diagnosed of mono or not

218
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,280
you get it

219
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,599
it goes away and then it comes

220
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,560
back on a rainy day and it comes back

221
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,160
with some vertigo

222
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,919
some dizziness some focus and

223
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,960
concentration issues a little bit of

224
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,919
anxiety

225
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
sometimes some depression migraines it

226
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,639
comes

227
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,759
back with all these different conditions

228
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,160
and symptoms

229
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,840
and everybody then goes looking for

230
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
answers and they're spending thousands

231
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,599
of dollars and they go to

232
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,319
alternative doctors of all kinds right

233
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,639
and they go to

234
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,080
every kind there is and they look for

235
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,039
answers and they don't find

236
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,319
them this book has changed the world

237
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,039
with this and it's so

238
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,639
it's so special science of research just

239
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,440
started talking about

240
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,879
epstein-barr now being linked to

241
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
hashimoto's

242
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,520
ra and fibromyalgia and lyme disease and

243
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,240
that's because science research follows

244
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,280
the lead

245
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,039
of the medical medium books so

246
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,199
i love when i hear out there someone say

247
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,639
where's your scientific evidence

248
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,960
well that's funny because science

249
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,440
research they take the medical medium

250
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,120
information and they use it later so i'm

251
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
the source for science research and

252
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,919
chronic illness

253
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,759
it's the medical medium books and that's

254
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,800
where they get their information

255
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,440
so i am the source for science and

256
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,360
research

257
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,279
include that involves lyme disease

258
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,719
science research for hashimoto's science

259
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,800
research for fibro

260
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,399
for all these things because it stems

261
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,000
from the original publication of the

262
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,720
medical medium book which was published

263
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
before

264
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
medical research and science even

265
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,519
started spouting out that fc bar has

266
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,000
anything to do with anything

267
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,440
so it's really exciting so you guys the

268
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,680
book is packed

269
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,959
it's a thick book it's a heavy book for

270
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,880
a reason

271
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,480
get ready to get mind blown when you get

272
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,600
into this book i'm going to talk about a

273
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,200
little bit about it i'm going to talk

274
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
about triggers today

275
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,800
so i know you guys are up against

276
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
triggers

277
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,880
and i do want to talk about triggers to

278
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,600
lyme disease triggers to other things

279
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,360
too

280
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,440
um other conditions and in this book

281
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,760
i talk about the plague we're up against

282
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,360
right now of why everybody's in lockdown

283
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,600
where everybody's going around with

284
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,600
masks on i talk about

285
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,519
that plague in the medical medium book

286
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,640
which is really cool

287
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,560
it's got way more information than even

288
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,279
cleanse to heal for specific

289
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,279
conditions for specific conditions so

290
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,800
this book is that pact

291
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,839
um and look i i can't cover what's in

292
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,760
this book

293
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,880
in one moment right here it's not

294
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,560
possible it's

295
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
that there's that much but i'm gonna

296
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,519
make the spinach soup i'm gonna talk

297
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
about lyme disease i'm going to talk

298
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,680
about triggers to chronic illness

299
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,880
this is going to be interesting i'm glad

300
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,399
you guys are on there

301
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,680
i saw lorraine l's on there um paige is

302
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,000

and yeah i'm glad everybody's coming on

305
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,040
here it's so important

306
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,279
so spinach soup is a powerful healing

307
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,839
tool i'm gonna start making a little bit

308
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
of it just

309
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,519
start giving you some at least the

310
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,880
ingredient ingredient so forth and how

311
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,480
it works i'm gonna put the book down for

312
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,839
a second

313
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,399
and um you know you guys the more and

314
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,480
more

315
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,600
trendy stuff i see out there that's bad

316
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,240
for us

317
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,839
um causing people to stay sick it's just

318
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,399
so disheartening i mean i can't believe

319
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,560
people are still talking about colostrum

320
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,200
they still think collagen is helpful i

321
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,519
mean these are things that are not

322
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,519
um

323
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,120
donna says i didn't know i was infected

324
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,240
by ebv before i read the book

325
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,120
then i did a lab for ebv

326
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
and igg yep and found that i had lots of

327
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,640
antibodies

328
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
i have graves and all the doctors told

329
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,680
me that

330
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
my autoimmune disease was caused by my

331
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,880
immune system going crazy and

332
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
donna what happens is that's what they

333
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,640
do they'll they'll blame it on your body

334
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,839
attacking itself they'll say that your

335
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,959
immune system is

336
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,640
attacking the organs and the the amazing

337
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,399
thing about this book is

338
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,079
i release the truth that that's not

339
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
accurate that the body

340
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,720
does not go against itself because the

341
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
minute you take that into your

342
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,959
consciousness

343
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,920
the minute it's all blamed on

344
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,720
you and your body it can go even more

345
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,320
wrong because

346
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,640
all of a sudden you're sick why am i

347
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,440
sick why do i have a condition

348
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,200
and now you get told by medical research

349
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,920
and science that tells doctors

350
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
that your immune system went haywire and

351
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,640
it's attacking your

352
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,160
organs and your glands and

353
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
that's not accurate that's not what

354
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,000
happens instead

355
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,079
it's about the epstein-barr virus that's

356
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,839
causing the inflammation

357
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,360
and your immune system's protecting you

358
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,040
and not causing a problem at all

359
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,560
it's there to protect you it's there to

360
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,600
look out for you

361
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,760
and this is this is the

362
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,440
the problems that happen out there where

363
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,360
people just they're

364
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,120
they get told that their body's

365
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,560
destroying itself they get told that

366
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,360
their bodies against them

367
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,320
and that's really disheartening very

368
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,399
damaging

369
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,079
doesn't allow the body to heal doesn't

370
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,839
allow us to move forward

371
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,600
doesn't allow us to get past their

372
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,320
illnesses because once we consciously

373
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,200
take that in

374
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,760
it's like wow my body's killing itself

375
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,399
hey

376
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,760
my body's hurting itself so there's no

377
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,399
way to fix this

378
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,279
uh what's the other answer it's genes

379
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,560
and

380
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,560
or maybe i'm thinking myself sick maybe

381
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,000
i'm creating it so that's the next thing

382
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,040
that occurs that's all wrong

383
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,399
right and your body is so beyond

384
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,440
intelligent

385
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
your body is that unconditionally loves

386
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,720
you

387
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,920
your body knows what's going on your

388
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,320
body doesn't attack

389
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,279
itself there's a real problem to why

390
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
we're sick

391
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,839
and that information i released in

392
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,200
medical medium book one to start with

393
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,519
years ago this is the new addition if

394
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,839
you guys just came on it just came out

395
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,160
i mean it's out in probably i don't know

396
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,320
four or five days or six days now so

397
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,360
it's the amazon.com has it

398
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,680
um barnes noble has it but i got my copy

399
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,680
i just got my copy all right and you

400
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,440
know i think i saw somebody online that

401
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,440
had a copy or an early copy they must

402
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,079
have got it from their local bookstore

403
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,720
and they had a copy before i did which

404
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,639
was really funny i laughed so hard

405
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,880
and um it's like i don't even have a

406
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,800
copy and they had a copy first

407
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,160
and uh that was so great to see that

408
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,000
that made me so happy

409
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,279
so anyway you guys um you go to your

410
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,880
local bookstore too okay

411
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:44,160
so educating myself good to see you

412
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,440
the tattoo truth bomb was awesome

413
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
you know you guys that you want to say

414
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
this one thing about that the tattoo

415
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,440
thing

416
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,399
in order for the ink to actually show up

417
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
and pop like show up and make a good

418
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,279
tattoo

419
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
all right they have to put toxic heavy

420
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,279
metals inside the ink

421
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,959
all right so wherever the ink is if you

422
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,240
want to get that scripture on the side

423
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,160
of your ribs or

424
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
wherever you get your ink you want to

425
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,959
get the butterflies on your ankles

426
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,279
whatever you're doing

427
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,519
wherever that ink is it has to be filled

428
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,079
with toxic heavy metals in order to

429
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,000
reflect light to come through the skin

430
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,040
so you can see it really well so that's

431
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,160
how it's done

432
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,800
so the light shines on the tattoo the

433
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,720
ink

434
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,000
underneath the skin reflects off the

435
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,160
toxic heavy metals

436
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,320
even the best vegan ink the best cruelty

437
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,639
free ink the best steriling the best

438
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,560
non-toxic ink whatever they say

439
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
there's metals in it so that the light

440
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,560
when it hits your skin if you get a

441
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,120
tattoo on your hand it hits the skin

442
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,360
it goes into it the light then reflects

443
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
off of the ink and pops back and that

444
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
because if they didn't put toxic heavy

445
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
metals in

446
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,279
ink you wouldn't see your ink it would

447
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,000
turn into a blob

448
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,000
literally a blob and that's why ink

449
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,040
fades throughout the years because the

450
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,680
metals leach down and they

451
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,680
drop deeper into the derma and the metal

452
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,440
stop having that reflection ability and

453
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,959
i didn't even say that part when i was

454
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,440
talking about the tattoos

455
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,560
i didn't even say that part that the ink

456
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,880
as it settles

457
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,320
deeper into the derma and then goes into

458
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,440
the bloodstream the metals

459
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,440
go into the bloodstream you lose the it

460
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,800
fades the reason why it's fading is

461
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,320
because the metals are

462
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,480
leaving the ink so so then this so that

463
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
so the light doesn't reflect so strong

464
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
and i didn't even say that part i was i

465
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
was

466
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,279
i was bummed out i didn't tell you guys

467
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,399
about that part too because it's such

468
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,000
good information

469
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,079
but um the point is don't get rid of

470
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,800
your ink and tattoos don't do that just

471
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,720
do the

472
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,160

sandy i completely understand and that's

510
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,399
that's that's what millions of women

511
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,000
when they discovered the medical medium

512
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
books and discovered this first book

513
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,079
here they were in that situation and

514
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
they needed to learn about the epstein

515
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,160
barr

516
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,919
they needed to learn how to learn how it

517
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,120
worked and they needed to learn some of

518
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,880
the foods

519
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,079
and if you guys can't get the book right

520
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,120
now on amazon.com like you can't buy it

521
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,760
maybe you know because you don't have

522
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,520
any money

523
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
or whatever just wait for the book to

524
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,319
come out for a while right and go to the

525
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,559
library

526
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,000
and ask for it or go straight to your

527
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,919
library and ask for it

528
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,120
so that they get a copy or something

529
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,880
like that or

530
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,559
so where people drop off their old

531
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,480
copies to the library

532
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,760
they'll they'll buy some extra copies

533
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
and they should deliver that's what we

534
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
do we'll

535
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,240
you know get copies and bring them to

536
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,240
libraries

537
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,480
anyway so let's go into this a little

538
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,679
bit i'm just going to pop a couple of

539
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,200
tomatoes in here

540
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,360
just to start with and we'll talk about

541
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,919
epstein-barr and talk about

542
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,200
stuff that's in the book so powerful

543
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,039
information

544
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,600
so i'm putting putting some tomatoes in

545
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,760
here because this is the spinach soup

546
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,360
you can do cherry tomatoes which i have

547
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,039
right here but

548
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,799
i'm in the mood for some of these these

549
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,360
beautiful tomatoes so i'm popping these

550
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,120
in here

551
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,120
do another one okay

552
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,840
so

553
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,480
so there are over 60 varieties of

554
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,520
epstein-barr i talk about it in medical

555
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,080
medium

556
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,840
secrets and i talk about how these are

557
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,240
mutations of the virus

558
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,200
as the years go by these the viruses do

559
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,120
different things

560
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,440
some viruses cause a little bit more

561
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,799
fibromyalgia some cause hashimoto's

562
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,080
thyroiditis

563
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,840
and different levels and they're

564
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,559
different aggressions of the virus

565
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,960
okay and that's what makes this all

566
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,320
different really what kind of virus do

567
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,720
you have do you have

568
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,440
you know epstein-barr which variety do

569
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,679
you have

570
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,360
how long have you had it you know you

571
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,039
know and these are the things that make

572
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,559
a big difference how many toxic heavy

573
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,720
metals do you have

574
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,160
um you know how many toxins overall

575
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,919
how's your liver the condition of your

576
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,120
liver all these things matter

577
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,799
and with epstein-barr what it likes to

578
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,160
do is it likes to start out

579
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,559
by incubating or going

580
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,120
dormant in the liver but epstein-barr

581
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,000
never really just goes dormant it lives

582
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,799
in us

583
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,240
and stays alive as our immune system

584
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,559
keeps it in check

585
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,799
and then we get triggers along the way

586
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,720
that become the triggers for the epstein

587
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,080
bar that's sitting inside of us

588
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,120
so like heartache betrayal

589
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,760
broken trust broken promises

590
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,720
these things hurt us really bad

591
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,240
emotional

592
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,320
abuse emotional hardship of any kind

593
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,320
all those are triggers so there's a lot

594
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,440
of emotional triggers from what we go

595
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,200
through hard times

596
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,039
and then we go into fight or flight and

597
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
our adrenaline is pumping and our immune

598
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,520
system drops

599
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,840
divorces breakups and relationships

600
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,799
and and then also we pick up epstein

601
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,520
bars people

602
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,440
pass around epstein bars in all kinds of

603
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,200
relationships because that's just normal

604
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,559
that's life it's like you get into a new

605
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,720
relationship and then

606
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,880
you got somebody else's epstein bar who

607
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,640
also had somebody else's epstein bar and

608
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,240
somebody else's epstein bar and said now

609
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,720
i've seen bars are like

610
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,480
they travel that way you know they can

611
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,600
travel in restaurants you go into

612
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
restaurants and you're

613
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,840
eating food in restaurants epstein bar

614
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,360
travels to restaurant food is probably

615
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,840
one of the big ways it travels

616
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,480
public bathrooms it can travel that way

617
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,960
and so

618
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,919
the whole population has an epstein-barr

619
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,039
r2

620
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,320
so that's the other thing so we all have

621
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,400
ebv in our system and that's just

622
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,559
the fact of life here the way of life

623
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,000
here in on planet earth and then but

624
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,440
that's okay

625
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,720
because when you know what to do to take

626
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,400
care of yourself and you know how to

627
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,039
stop it from causing problems you know

628
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,840
how to fix it when you have a problem

629
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,200
that's what matters it's it's not about

630
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,600
the fact that we pick

631
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,280
epstein-barr up easy whether it's a new

632
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,240
relationship

633
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,840
a new friendship um you know some

634
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,280
restaurant food somewhere from a chef

635
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,600
cutting their finger or

636
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,520
sweat dripping off a chef's you know

637
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,799
forehead and dropping it right on your

638
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,159
salad

639
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,799
which is really an easy way to pass ebv

640
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,000
um either way when we pick up new

641
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,679
varieties

642
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,280
and then they're in our system and then

643
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,480
they become a problem

644
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,000
later on we can do something about it

645
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,320
and that's the whole point

646
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,720
even if we didn't get fibro yet or

647
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,039
eczema yet or psoriasis

648
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,600
or we didn't get another condition lyme

649
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,200
disease or we didn't get cfs or focusing

650
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,480
concentration issues or something or

651
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,880
dizziness or

652
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,600
some kind of mysterious symptom even if

653
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,520
we didn't go

654
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,440
there yet we can take care of ourselves

655
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,360
and we can clean abv up out of our

656
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,039
system because everybody has it

657
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,559
and eventually they get something if

658
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,240
they don't take care of themselves you

659
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,000
know someone might be young and seem

660
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,159
strong and indestructible now

661
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,080
they're on instagram they're on social

662
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,840
media they're on facebook

663
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,280
they're on youtube and they think they

664
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
got it all down

665
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,559
and they're doing their their you know

666
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,520
foods and whatever it is in their

667
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,080
lifestyle and

668
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,039
boom they're 38 years old years later

669
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,200
and then

670
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,960
now we got ebv we got symptoms and they

671
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,880
doubt everything and now they don't know

672
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,440
what to do and i got all kinds of brain

673
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,280
fog

674
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,880
and back pain and all kinds of stuff so

675
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,039
it's it's really important to have

676
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,840
control over your health entirely and

677
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,960
not just be

678
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,480
in this place of you know you think you

679
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,159
got control but you don't

680
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,840
and the one thing about medical medium

681
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,840
books especially this one

682
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,120
is it allowed people to become so

683
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,440
empowered

684
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,880
that they were able to actually stop

685
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,039
things from coming their way

686
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,919
stop conditions from coming their way

687
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,520
they were they were able to stop eb

688
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,440
from causing harm and in the shingles

689
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,120
too which is also in this book and

690
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,120
so it's so important and then there's

691
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,600
like this book also brought to light for

692
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,159
the first time what bell's palsy was

693
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,240
which is shingles back pain that's

694
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,400
mysterious which is shingles virus and

695
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,720
there's over 30 varieties of shingles

696
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,440
so this book brought that information to

697
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,799
light

698
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,600
as well okay and frozen shoulder

699
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,520
colitis so it it broke the truth about

700
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
colitis which is the shingles frozen

701
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,600
shoulder which is the shingles

702
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,159
um bell's palsy with which is the

703
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,440
shingles back pain like sciatica which

704
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,600
is the shingles

705
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,559
and um so it's just so great i just put

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,159
some tomatoes in now i'm gonna put

707
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,679

small they're small celery sticks

711
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,960

i keep on being told first of all i was

727
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,400
i was asked to write the books

728
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,240
i was asked by thousands of people

729
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,799
because you guys know that i worked with

732
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,919
and i was told every day by doctors

733
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,000
every day by practitioners to write the

you've got to help millions of people

739
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,400
everybody needs an opportunity

740
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,679
everybody needs a chance so i wrote the

741
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,320
books and that's and that's what

742
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,240
happened

743
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,080
like the world changed the world of

744
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,679
medicine changed because of this book

745
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,760

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,200
completely changed in chronic illness

747
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,000
because of this book

748
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,039
and um and so that was really special

749
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,320
but

750
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,919
but now i'm being told don't keep on

751
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,200
writing the books

752
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,640
create programs you know create programs

753
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,240
people all they have to do is spend two

754
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,240
thousand dollars for the program

755
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,440
they can learn from the program and you

756
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,360
can create multiple pro

757
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,200
programs you know two thousand dollars a

758
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,039
piece i'm like no i want this

759
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,760
affordable i want a book that's

760
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,919
really really affordable you can get

761
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,279
your life saved and bring your life back

762
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,200
i don't want to do that i don't want to

763
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,039
stop writing the books no matter how

764
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,559
hard the books are to write and do

765
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,159
i don't want to just stop writing the

766
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,760
books and create programs

767
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,279
so people have to pay two three thousand

768
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,960
dollars for a program in order to learn

769
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,360
how to heal it just doesn't seem

770
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,120
fair to me it just doesn't right now it

771
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,600
just doesn't it just doesn't feel right

772
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,240
so

773
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,720
the book's there it's affordable and

774
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
it's just

775
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,640
it's just such a great way to heal i'm

776
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,039
gonna pop in some orange in here you

777
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
guys

778
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,559
so i'm making the spinach soup which is

779
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,080
really a famous recipe for healing

780
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,919
it's one of the medical medium healing

781
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,799
tools you guys laur

782
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,080
uh lorelai hey what about tomatoes being

783
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,000
nightshades

784
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,799
what about them being nightshades

785
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,840
because that's misinformation out there

786
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:58,159
nightshades was a

787
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,360
theory basically because okay it goes

788
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,360
back to this book

789
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,039
i'm glad you asked that question it's so

790
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,279
important

791
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,720
before this book came out no one knew

792
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,600
what was wrong with anybody

793
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,679
so lorelai think about it okay you got

794
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,159
almost 100 years of chronic illness

795
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,240
right

796
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,279
people rushing to doctors not having any

797
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,960
answers

798
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:21,360
and um so a lot of theories were created

799
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,279
because nobody knew why anybody was sick

800
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,400
so then they'd be guessing games like

801
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,880
what if it's

802
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,840
these tomatoes because it's a night

803
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,360
shade

804
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,559
a spooky night shade

805
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,279
kind of vegetable fruit thing right

806
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,200
so that's one that was just a theory but

807
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,520
there's no science behind it

808
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,600
causing a problem there's no truth

809
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,880
behind it they've never been able to

810
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,880
link anything to it

811
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,480
and so like rheumatoid arthritis isn't

812
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,200
caused by a tomato

813
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,960
it's caused by epstein-barr virus so you

814
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,320
got all these people they're going into

815
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,320
you know functional medicine doctors

816
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,360
offices chinese medicine doctors offices

817
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,919
naturopathic doctors offices do's doctor

818
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,000
you know osteopathic doctors going in

819
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,679
there looking for help for years like

820
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,480
the 1960s the 1970s the 1980s

821
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,320
and the 1990s no one having answers like

822
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,559
why are we sick why are we sick

823
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,399
and then it's like all you have to do is

824
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,200
just come up and pull something out of

825
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,880
thin air

826
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,559
pull something out of somebody's you

827
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,159
know whatever and just all of a sudden

828
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,679
you're like you pull something out

829
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,159
and it's like night shades that's the

830
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,000
answer and that's why people are sick uh

831
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,440
now it's lectins that's why people are

832
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,799
sick well that's funny because millions

833
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,279
of people already healed

834
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,320
and they healed using the tomatoes they

835
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,080
healed using

836
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,240
potatoes they healed using all the

837
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,039
medical medium tools and foods that i

838
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,880
talked about

839
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,720
and lectins didn't stop them from

840
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,159
healing their diseases and chronic

841
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,399
illness and everything else

842
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,320
these are just these are guessing games

843
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,360
to when someone doesn't know why

844
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,760
somebody's sick

845
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,559
so it's like it must be the nightshade

846
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,760
it must be

847
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,320
the leptin it must be hmm

848
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,159
and maybe it's you know that vegetable

849
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,000
that makes people sick so people just

850
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,799
wanna they they just throw the guessing

851
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
games out

852
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,559
and the guessing games maybe it's

853
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,840
candida that makes them sick because

854
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,159
that was a complete

855
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,399
farce and i talked about the whole

856
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,120
candida mistake that happened out there

857
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,120
and

858
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,960
so and maybe it's the histamines maybe

859
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,840
it's oxalates

860
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,600
maybe it's that and and it's all a

861
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,480
guessing game and that's the sad

862
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,279
part so what happens is you get sucked

863
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,720
into that

864
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,960
you totally get sucked into that and

865
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,440
that and that's a problem it really is

866
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,720
um because if you really get sick

867
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,600
someday

868
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,279
and you're running from a tomato

869
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,880
basically you're running from a bee

870
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,640
a bumble bee and then you run right out

871
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,399
into a street and get hit by a bus and

872
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,480
you're mauled by a bus

873
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,000
because you're running from a bee and

874
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,440
the bee wasn't going to sting you

875
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,279
because the tomatoes not going to hurt

876
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,880
you it's just this is what they do they

877
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,880
set this i i think they

878
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,200
i think it's done purposely and by

879
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,399
accident kind of a both of a combination

880
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,919
out there it's like they just set

881
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,440
everybody up for failure it's like no

882
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,720
one wants anybody to truly heal or

883
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,640
something

884
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,360
um and where did if you had a problem

885
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,720
with tomato what was it was it really a

886
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,880
tomato like

887
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,640
it was it a ripe perfectly ripe vine

888
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,279
tomato like this

889
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,960
and you cut it and you ate a piece of it

890
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,080
and then something bad happened

891
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,039
or was it the tomato sauce that was on a

892
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,840
pizza

893
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,600
that was on with cheese and bad oil and

894
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,640
gluten in the crust was it that

895
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,440
was it some other was it ketchup

896
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,960
with vinegar in it was it that that was

897
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,520
used for something else you know what i

898
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,360
mean

899
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,120
because those are the things that will

900
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,640
get you sick it's the vinegar it's the

901
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,200
cheese on a pizza

902
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,120
that's what's gonna amp up the

903
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,840
epstein-barr virus

904
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:50,080
tomatoes are anti-viral tomatoes are

905
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,880
anti-pathogen they're anti-bug

906
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,039
and you know i remember teaching people

907
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,880
about how the nightshade confusion was

908
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,960
wrong from the beginning and it freed

909
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,720
so many people they can heal they can

910
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,240
eat potatoes and tomatoes

911
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,840
so matt says your books info

912
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,159
changed my life sue says false i used to

913
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,799
get

914
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,799
kidney stones now i have none of none

915
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,679
and eat all the oxalates especially

916
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,679
spinach

917
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:22,799
and crap spinach is an anti-kidney stone

918
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,799
uh you know fixer or whatever it's like

919
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,159
it's the anti-kidney stone

920
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,880
tool spinach is healing it heals the

921
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,559
kidneys

922
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,240
it heals the body it heals the

923
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,919
gallbladder but that's how

924
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,520
misinformation works out there it has

925
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,880
tons of it out there you guys

926
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,640
tons of it it's it's overwhelming now

927
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,919
you know medical medium information when

928
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,520
it hit the scene

929
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,799
uh i've been teaching it forever but

930
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,799
when it hit the scene in the

931
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,799
publications of the books and stuff

932
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,000
it was like it had such a leg up because

933
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,840
everybody's like fresh air

934
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,440

like when that book came to me i was

980
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,320
like oh my god i can't believe i have it

981
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,799

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,799
triggers

987
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,080
with chronic illness triggers with

988
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,519
symptoms and conditions we're going to

989
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,200
talk about lyme disease

990
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,559
so we're going to go into that that's

991
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,640
where we're heading now

992
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,159
just making some spinach soup i want to

993
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,159
give you guys kind of a little in on

994
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,039
this of what i got going on here so

995
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,120
i got the cilantro i got the tomatoes i

996
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,519
got some celery sticks thrown in there i

997
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,360
squeezed some orange in there

998
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:12,000
um jamie

999
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,440
my husband has a horrible reaction to

1000
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,519
onion and garlic

1001
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,279
no doctors can figure out why um

1002
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,720
depends on the reaction well first of

1003
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,399
all um

1004
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,159
i would stay away from onions and garlic

1005
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,279
if he's having a bad reaction i would

1006
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,320
stay away from them for sure onions and

1007
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,000
garlic

1008
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,519
can kill bacteria so bacteria

1009
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,640
like h pylori it can kill bacteria

1010
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,960
like streptococcus it can kill

1011
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,880
bacteria like staph and what happens in

1012
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,720
people's intestinal tracts it gets so

1013
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,360
mucky in there you get a lot of staph

1014
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,720
you get c

1015
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,679
diff staph streptococcus e coli and h

1016
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,559
pylori

1017
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,279
so the even if you're not exhibiting

1018
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,440
symptoms

1019
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,240
there's people out there that have a lot

1020
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,200
of e coli streptococcus h pylori staph

1021
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,159
c diff in their intestinal tract small

1022
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,000
intestinal tract

1023
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,200
even in their stomach they have some of

1024
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,159
it so when you

1025
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,280
drop some garlic in there the garlic is

1026
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,599
giving direct

1027
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,320
kill-off so we're talking direct

1028
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,599
kill-off

1029
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,440
on that stuff the minute or the second

1030
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,679
that e coli explodes depending

1031
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,679
if it's got some toxins in it if that

1032
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,639
bacteria like strep e coli c

1033
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,960
diff staph uh h pylori has actually

1034
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,280
toxins in it or some bad toxins in it

1035
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,760
the minute those buggers explode from

1036
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,599
that direct hit from the garlic right

1037
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,399
and i'm looking for my garlic here it is

1038
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,520
the minute that garlic goes down

1039
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,200
and it hits those bugs and they die you

1040
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,960
don't even need a lot of those bugs to

1041
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,000
die you can have just a little bit of e

1042
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,639
coli dye

1043
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,720
a little bit of strep a tiny tiny bit of

1044
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,359
strep or e coli or anything

1045
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,200
if you you know if if they die then you

1046
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,040
get all you get the reactions you can

1047
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,200
get a lot of reactions okay

1048
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,520
and that's people who are loaded with

1049
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,160
all the different levels of bacteria

1050
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,160
in their system right so we can do is is

1051
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,960
how much garlic first of all i wouldn't

1052
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,920
do

1053
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,680
cooked garlic if i was somebody that was

1054
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,079
really hypersensitive

1055
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,880
because cooked garlic can still kill off

1056
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,800
the pathogens too but cooked garlic

1057
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,839
tends to be a little bit different

1058
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,480
digesting wise i mean i would say

1059
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,680
tiny bit if you're ever if you know if

1060
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,680
you're ever up against something like

1061
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,440
this but you want garlic you want onions

1062
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,599
it would be a tiny bit

1063
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,280
because when you use a tiny bit you end

1064
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,359
up killing just

1065
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,599
less you end up killing less of that

1066
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,920
bacteria so you might be able to slowly

1067
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,200
kill off that bacteria over time

1068
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,160
and get to that point where you can

1069
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,920
actually have garlic again or

1070
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:51,760
stay off the garlic and onions right

1071
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,480
and just change the diet so you're not

1072
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,200
feeding those bugs let them die off on

1073
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,920
their own

1074
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,560
naturally over time i have a gut health

1075
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,960
chapter

1076
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,000
in this medical medium book right here

1077
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,119
which is incredible gut health chapter

1078
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,480
um it's so much information in here it

1079
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,599
really there really is

1080
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,680
and so you can do like the healing foods

1081
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,720
make sure there's no gluten milk cheese

1082
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,520
or butter

1083
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,079
to keep the ice creams out keep all that

1084
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,760
out of there

1085
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,839
and there's protocols in the book too

1086
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,280
just eating better like the 28 day

1087
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,240
cleanse in the medical medium book

1088
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,599
just eating better like the 28 day

1089
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,040
cleanse in that book can be really

1090
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,400
helpful so that now you're killing off

1091
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,680
the bacteria and i recommend that to

1092
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,320
everybody and that's why a lot of people

1093
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,720
healed

1094
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,640
when you're doing the 28 day cleanse

1095
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,720
you're starving

1096
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,079
that e coli that's in everybody you know

1097
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,839
i know people today they'll be like i

1098
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,800
don't got any e coli in my system i go

1099
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,640
yeah you do

1100
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,079
of course you do i don't got any strep

1101
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,599
in my system well did you have strep

1102
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,960
throat before yeah i had a sore throat

1103
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,480
and they said it was strapped back

1104
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,680
when i was younger yeah it's still in

1105
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,440
your system it's in your gut and

1106
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,280
eventually it causes sibo and then you

1107
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,920
get the sibo diagnosis right

1108
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,839
so and you know people got that e coli

1109
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,599
they got the strep they got the h pylori

1110
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,079
people are loaded with this stuff you

1111
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,200
know

1112
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,119
the 28 day cleanse in medical medium

1113
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,880
took away the foods that feed these

1114
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,960
pathogens feed the bacteria and

1115
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,760
proliferate this bacteria right

1116
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,280
the 20-day cleanse took away that people

1117
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,640
like getting their lives back on the

1118
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,920
28-day cleanse

1119
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,880
healing because they were taking away

1120
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,400
foods that feed the bugs right so here

1121
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,560
you go

1122
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,480
that's your bacteria that's your e coli

1123
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,440
that's your streptococcus

1124
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,720
that's your h pylori that's your c diff

1125
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,079
that's your staff

1126
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,880
okay sits inside everybody's guts 28-day

1127
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,480
cleanse

1128
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,320
took away the food that feeds the

1129
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,680
bacteria so the bacteria couldn't eat

1130
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,839
anymore it's like wait a minute

1131
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,760
this person's on the 28-day cleanse and

1132
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,960
i can't find any food and i'm starting

1133
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,720
to starve in here

1134
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,560
and this person's cleaning up so i can't

1135
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,599
even find old food that's hanging around

1136
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,119
the intestinal tract

1137
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,200
and then the bacteria is like where do i

1138
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,599
go where do i go and it weakens and

1139
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,599
weakens and eventually dies off or

1140
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,880
gets flushed out and pushed out by the

1141
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,079
20-day cleanse

1142
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,440
and that's how people were getting

1143
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,880
better that's one way they're getting

1144
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,880
better from the 28-day cleanse

1145
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,720
making the spinach soup let's talk about

1146
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,359
lyme disease

1147
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,800
let me put a little bit of spinach in

1148
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,960
here

1149
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,920
let me put a little bit of spinach let's

1150
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,920
do that right now

1151
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,359
honestly people being afraid of spinach

1152
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,079
is heartbreaking

1153
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,119
breaks my heart totally does you guys i

1154
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,119
mean seriously

1155
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,839
it's so sad that's misinformation once

1156
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,839
again out there

1157
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,520
michelle been tested and allergic to

1158
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,680
tomatoes

1159
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,599
missed so much there's a difference

1160
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,040
between and i told a doctor friend about

1161
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,000
this recently there's a difference

1162
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,320
between

1163
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,119
what a test says for your foods because

1164
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,280
you can go

1165
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,640
and get tested do a food sensitivity

1166
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,480
test and they'll be like you're allergic

1167
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,000
to tomatoes you're allergic to eggplant

1168
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,599
allergic to strawberries you're allergic

1169
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,200
to cilantro you're allergic to

1170
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,720
some kind of weird ragweed you're

1171
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,359
allergic to whatever and they just throw

1172
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,440
all the stuff

1173
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,720
in stuff that isn't even food stuff that

1174
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,320
you would never eat in a million years

1175
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,200
you're allergic to star and nice you're

1176
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,880
allergic to

1177
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,119
ginger you know they'll just do all the

1178
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,760
stuff right and

1179
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,440
meanwhile you're getting tested by a

1180
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,359
system that doesn't know why you're sick

1181
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,200
or doesn't know why anybody's sick

1182
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,640
food sensitivities they don't know why

1183
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,800
anybody's sick do they know why the

1184
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,160
world's sick i mean unless they know

1185
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,160
unless they're actually doing what

1186
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,000
science research is now taking

1187
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,280
taking all the cues from medical medium

1188
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,400
books they're not going to know why

1189
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,160
anybody's sick

1190
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,720
so um so what i told the doctor friend

1191
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,800
is like

1192
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,960
are you and dr fred actually said well

1193
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,400
my food sensitivity test says i'm

1194
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,359
allergic tomatoes and i said to my

1195
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,760
doctor friend i said

1196
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,280
so if you ate a tomato what happened so

1197
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,599
i gave him a tomato

1198
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,320
and i said if you eat a tomato what

1199
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,400
happens

1200
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,320
say nothing nothing happens if i eat a

1201
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,160
tomato but my food sensitivities

1202
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,240
test says you know i'm allergic to it

1203
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,119
like okay well that's really funny

1204
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,920
because

1205
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,200
um you can eat it and you're fine yeah i

1206
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,880
could eat it i'm fine

1207
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,480
like what else does your test say you're

1208
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,520
allergic to test says i'm allergic to

1209
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,119
blackberries

1210
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,440
what happens when eat the blackberries

1211
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,400
nothing i'm fine like okay

1212
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,760
and what happens is those tests they're

1213
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,640
not perfect

1214
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,560
and they never were they never will be

1215
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,560
it's different if you're eating a tomato

1216
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,160
and your mouth is swelling up and your

1217
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,040
throat's swelling up and you can't

1218
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,480
breathe

1219
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,000
look i don't want you to eat tomato if

1220
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,680
you don't want to eat a tomato do what

1221
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,440
your doctor says your doctor says don't

1222
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,760
eat a tomato don't eat a tomato

1223
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,880
i'm just telling you about my experience

1224
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,400
with a doctor friend

1225
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,560
who said well you know my food

1226
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,760
sensitivity test is i'm orange tomatoes

1227
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,400
i guess i shouldn't have um and

1228
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,040
meanwhile you know last week or whatever

1229
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,240
it's like

1230
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,440
i had a pizza you know he was like

1231
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,800
whatever uh nozilla when i first started

1232
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,880
to drink celery juice

1233
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,200
i had a lot of shivering and diarrhea

1234
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,280
it was a sign that lots of cleansing was

1235
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,839
happening i don't have any

1236
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,839
any of these drastic symptoms anymore

1237
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,720
because i have healed so much with mm

1238
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,560
info

1239
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,079
what that is is when you do your celery

1240
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,440
juice and i got my juicer over there in

1241
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,480
the corner can you guys see it i

1242
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,079
actually just juiced

1243
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,160
pretty recently before i started this

1244
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,240
live and i drank my juice

1245
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,920
um what happens is when you're doing

1246
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,440
your celery juice and i just put a

1247
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,480
little celery in the spinach soup by the

1248
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,000
way

1249
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,680
when you're doing that the sodium

1250
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,760
cluster salt and celery destroy

1251
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,880
pathogens so it looks like this so

1252
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,480
here you go you got all these little

1253
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,520
bugs in here right you guys know this

1254
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,359
one right

1255
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,960
it's my little friend virus right

1256
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,560
epstein-barr

1257
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,760
and bacteria okay streptococcus

1258
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,800
so people are filled with all the

1259
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,480
bacteria they're filled with all the

1260
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,160
strep you start dropping celery juice in

1261
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,560
there the sodium cluster salts start to

1262
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
strip

1263
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,760
down the membrane and that's what

1264
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,359
happens the bacteria will have this

1265
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,359
membrane all around it like this you see

1266
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,680
this that's that's the membrane and

1267
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,359
that celery juice starts to eat away you

1268
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,200
see these little furry things that stick

1269
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,280
up that stick off this bacteria

1270
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,480
that's actually accurate bacteria will

1271
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,640
have fur on it

1272
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,319
some viruses will have fur on it that's

1273
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,119
their first defense mechanism right

1274
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,480
there

1275
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,119
they have first sticking out of their

1276
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,400
membrane that's what that's what happens

1277
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,720
and so just to break that down

1278
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,000
is is difficult all on its own but not

1279
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,920
for celery juice celery

1280
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,760
juice the sodium cluster salt starts to

1281
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,359
break down that membrane

1282
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,599
and and that's then starts to really

1283
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,599
help

1284
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,920
and julia my daughter's eczema

1285
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,440
went away uh do his protocol celery

1286
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,240
juice no eggs supplements

1287
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,760
dot dot dot incredible incredible um you

1288
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,040
guys have if you just got on here i'm

packed with information even more i put

1299
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,160
a whole book in this that's why

1300
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,680
it's so big and now that's the whole bit

1301
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,760
um so

1302
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,280
this book the lyme disease section of

1303
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,720
this book has changed the way doctors

1304
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,680
see lyme disease

1305
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,760
so it's changed the way they see it

1306
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,599
because this book exposed the truth

1307
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,359
about lyme disease that lyme disease

1308
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,720
is viral not bacterial so okay

1309
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:20,319
so this lyme disease is caused by

1310
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:23,440
viruses not bacteria okay

1311
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:27,040
and so that was what this book exposed

1312
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:30,480
um and also what happened with this book

1313
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,520
is it forced the medical science

1314
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,880
of the world it forced them to abandon

1315
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,119
the theory that lyme disease was

1316
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,640
bacteria so they abandoned it

1317
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,160
so medical research and science doesn't

1318
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,640
believe lyme disease is bacteria

1319
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,079
anymore now the lyme labs that your

1320
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,119
doctor sends the tet

1321
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,160
the blood to right

1322
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,480
they won't abandon the idea

1323
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,720
that it's bacteria because they built

1324
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,280
their empires

1325
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,800
on lyme disease being bacteria so you

1326
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,040
got these lyme labs

1327
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,720
that have made billions of dollars for

1328
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,000
the last 50 years

1329
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,680
40 50 years and they can't abandon it so

1330
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,160
you've got the lyme labs

1331
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,520
with then you've got the doctors that

1332
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,520
are the old dogs now

1333
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,000
the old dogs that believe that still

1334
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,400
believe lyme disease is bacterial

1335
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,520
you got them working with the lyme labs

1336
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,119
but then

1337
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,280
you got medical research and science

1338
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,000
which is their boss

1339
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,000
doctor's boss in medical research and

1340
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,920
science is the boss of doctors it's the

1341
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,760
boss of the lyme labs

1342
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,440
that big boss doesn't believe it's

1343
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,760
bacterial anymore because of medical

1344
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,680
medium books so they took lyme disease

1345
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,359
out of the bacterial world and they put

1346
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,880
it now in autoimmune so now it's an

1347
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,280
autoimmune they don't know what it is so

1348
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,599
they

1349
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,560
they're just like it could be viral it's

1350
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,240
not bacterial

1351
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,280
we don't know what lyme disease is

1352
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,000
anymore and that's because of the

1353
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,040
medical medium books now

1354
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,720
antibiotics destroyed thousands and

1355
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,480
thousands of women's lives now i say

1356
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,160
women because they were mostly stricken

1357
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,800
by this disease

1358
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,760
not men and that's still like that today

1359
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,319
now okay

1360
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,280
so tens of thousands of women's lives

1361
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,760
were destroyed because

1362
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,839
antibiotics because the overuse of

1363
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,800
bombarding their system with antibiotics

1364
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,560
when their condition

1365
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,960
wasn't bacterial this book

1366
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,000
has saved countless women's lives

1367
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,040
because they didn't have to

1368
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,359
go through all that heavy bombardment of

1369
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,000
that

1370
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,800
old school antibiotic treatment for lyme

1371
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,560
disease

1372
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,960
they were able to be freed from that and

1373
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,119
recover without having their life

1374
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,160
destroyed and that's what this book did

1375
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,119
the original one

1376
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,560
well now this is the new new and even

1377
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,400
improved because i added so much

1378
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,119
information into it okay

1379
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,920
now there's these doctors on podcasts

1380
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,680
right now

1381
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,599
there's some some of them famous

1382
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,440
whatever there's doctors on television

1383
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,040
with doing television careers

1384
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,440
and they were responsible for the damage

1385
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,560
and the life and the death of thousands

1386
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,560
of women

1387
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,119
going back many years of lyme disease

1388
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,000
but see no one ever corrects anything so

1389
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,920
they just kind of be

1390
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,839
act like a chameleon and now they're

1391
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,319
chameleon to another direction like oh i

1392
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,960
didn't

1393
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,720
i didn't run a clinic and give hundreds

1394
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,200
and hundreds and hundreds of women

1395
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,640
tons of antibiotics and destroyed their

1396
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,800
lives that wasn't me

1397
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,200
uh you know with the old lyme disease

1398
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,079
theory they keep on they keep on jumping

1399
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,240
from

1400
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,839
old theory to new theory to new theory

1401
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,520
to new theory to new theory

1402
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,720
and they don't clean up the mess nobody

1403
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,240
knows what they did now they're on

1404
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,079
podcasts or have their own podcast

1405
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,640
meanwhile they've destroyed so many

1406
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,280
lives doctors from new england doctors

1407
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,560
from around

1408
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,040
you know the country around the world

1409
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,520
now they're famous for their podcast or

1410
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,599
something

1411
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,839
and literally they have a wake behind

1412
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,599
them blood on their hands

1413
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,040
uh because i know i've been in this for

1414
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,160
35 years i know

1415
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,160
who screwed up everything

1416
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,079
when it came down to that i know how

1417
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,920
that worked people who lost their lives

1418
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,119
i know the good doctors versus the bad

1419
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,640
doctors i know

1420
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,560
what happened in the lyme disease world

1421
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,640
and it's it's really hell

1422
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,680
and there's a terrible thing and what

1423
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,000
happened so

1424
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,599
this book has changed that for so many

1425
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,280
women so they don't have to go that

1426
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,160
route of being bombard

1427
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,839
bombarded being completely just having

1428
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,000
their systems wrecked with tons of

1429
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,400
antibiotics not knowing that it's viral

1430
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,240
and

1431
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,800
being told it's bacterial and that's

1432
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,960
what's incredible about the book so

1433
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,720
and no one sees those mistakes no one no

1434
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,200
one care who cares if tens of thousands

1435
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,440
of women lost their lives

1436
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,800
from lyme disease and you know who cares

1437
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,640
because it doesn't matter

1438
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,800
those doctors they never get like no one

1439
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,119
ever says hey so you just spent

1440
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,920
20 years bombarding you know women with

1441
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,040
so much and

1442
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,480
sarah says i was given so much doxy yeah

1443
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,680
in boxing it was brutal

1444
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,520
sarah that was the old way

1445
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,359
and that's the way that now you'll see

1446
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,040
these podcast doctors out there

1447
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,480
that you know are doing their podcast

1448
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,200
they got all this money behind them and

1449
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,400
they're

1450
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,520
they have a history of

1451
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,520
bombarding women with antibiotics and

1452
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,960
they don't even like they don't come to

1453
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,200
the table and say well

1454
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,800
made a mistake shouldn't have done that

1455
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,000
i shouldn't maybe we shouldn't have gone

1456
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,079
that direction

1457
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,040
you know no and they don't just keep on

1458
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,520
going with the

1459
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,359
you know the theories and the bs and who

1460
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,000
cares you know it's amazing

1461
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,640
amy beasley explain why when a lyme

1462
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,680
patient

1463
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,359
takes antibiotics when they have um

1464
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,960
why they have they die off or hurts

1465
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,720
yeah absolutely i talk about it medical

1466
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,319
medium book here

1467
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,000
they're not having a die off when they

1468
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,520
take antibiotics they're having a

1469
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,200
reaction their nervous system is having

1470
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,480
a reaction to the toxic nature of the

1471
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,040
antibiotics now i'm not against

1472
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,640
antibiotics okay and do what your doctor

1473
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,040
wants to do but the point is

1474
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,920
is that i'm asked this all the time by a

1475
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,760
lot of people

1476
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,760
and what happens is and i taught about

1477
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,400
this for years and taught doctors this

1478
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,040
too

1479
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,720
herxheimer is a theory that there's a

1480
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,319
die-off happening

1481
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,319
you so you just think there's a die-off

1482
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,680
happening but what it is

1483
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,640
it's an adverse reaction to the

1484
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,960
antibiotic because when you have lyme

1485
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,720
you have viral inflammation to the

1486
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,400
nervous system and when the nerves are

1487
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,599
very sensitive i'll say it again

1488
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,760
you have viral information inflammation

1489
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,040
to the nervous system so the vagus nerve

1490
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,640
the phrenic nerves

1491
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,400
all the nerves in the body they get

1492
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,640
sensitive as heck

1493
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,000
so when something toxic like an

1494
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,280
antibiotic it's driven into

1495
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,200
the body whether it's through

1496
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,960
intravenous or any other way

1497
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,240
you think you're getting herxheimer but

1498
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,960
what you're doing is just

1499
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,559
hurting bad your nerves are hurting bad

1500
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,119
hypersensitive nerves

1501
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,160
from viral infections they can't handle

1502
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,599
a lot of things

1503
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,119
and that's the great mistake in the

1504
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,400
industry but i would listen to your

1505
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,079
doctor if he thinks you need to be on

1506
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,680
antibiotics you go on antibiotics if

1507
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,920
that's what your doctor wants

1508
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,359
you know or whatever and and all that

1509
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,960
i'm just saying that look you can always

1510
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,119
take the book to your doctor

1511
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,640
and and maybe educate him and maybe

1512
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,400
he'll see some other things

1513
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,400
but whatever whatever your doctor says

1514
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,319
do um

1515
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,520
but that's how it works with herxheimers

1516
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,559
and that's how it works with the whole

1517
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,079
situation

1518
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,760
um anyway

1519
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,359
talk about triggers in a second let me

1520
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,480
just blend this up a little bit

1521
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,960
and then we're going to go into some

1522
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,839
triggers that's the next thing

1523
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:13,599
so i'm going to make the spinach soup

1524
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:16,079
let me at least do some blending

1525
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:27,200
now you can use more spinach you can use

1526
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:28,640
less spinach not a lot there's not

1527
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,090
that much spinach in this one but

1528
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,680
there's definitely some in there

1529
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:35,920
[Music]

1530
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,920
so

1531
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:44,240
tammy can it just affect one side

1532
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,160
of the body i have ebv shingles and more

1533
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,800
it affects the left side from

1534
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,440
from ear to toe yeah absolutely

1535
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,559
definitely can affect one side

1536
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,280
epstein-barr hasn't um

1537
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,839
epstein-barr and shingles loves to

1538
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,800
affect

1539
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,000
one side in many many situations it just

1540
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,040
does

1541
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:09,839
i've seen bar can too

1542
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,839
i'll tell you why in a minute

1543
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,200
okay that spinach soup is blended

1544
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,800
epstein-barr releases neurotoxins

1545
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,440
some nerves will be more sensitive to

1546
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,200
their neurotoxins than other nerves

1547
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,119
what happens is if you've been under any

1548
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,240
stress your adrenals will

1549
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,440
release adrenaline and the left side of

1550
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,480
the body

1551
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,000
can be hit with more adrenaline from a

1552
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,520
stronger adrenal which could be the

1553
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,319
adrenal that's on the left side of your

1554
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,440
body too

1555
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,119
so when you're going through fight or

1556
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,520
flight any kind of stress in your life

1557
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,359
anything financial stress anything

1558
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,640
you know could be relationships whatever

1559
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,800
happens in your life

1560
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,079
that adrenal gland pumps out more and

1561
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,599
more and more adrenaline

1562
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,359
weakens the nervous system a little but

1563
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,559
you really can't feel that until the

1564
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,160
epstein bar releases all these

1565
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,760
neurotoxins and when the neurotoxins

1566
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,800
land on nerves it's going to be whatever

1567
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,160
nerves

1568
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,240
are your most sensitive and they're

1569
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,000
going to light right up shingles on the

1570
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,040
other hand can focus on one side of the

1571
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,880
body so

1572
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,319
you know it that can happen too but

1573
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,760
epstein-barr can

1574
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,319
can do different things there's

1575
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,280
different varieties

1576
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,280
glad you guys are here

1577
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,559
gotta pay attention when i cook when i

1578
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,800
prepare foods

1579
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,079
gary said i was really crippled with

1580
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,079
many lyme symptoms

1581
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,520
after a spider bite four years ago thank

1582
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,559
you anthony for bringing me back let's

1583
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,240
talk about triggers

1584
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,040
let's do that you guys i'm gonna pour

1585
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,040
this out in a minute

1586
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,640
but i'd like to talk about triggers and

1587
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,400
how it works

1588
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,839
a spider bite can lower your immune

1589
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,599
system

1590
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,960
and when your immune system is lowered

1591
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,640
because the spider bite is a trigger

1592
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,280
when your immune system is lowered

1593
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,640
now the epstein bar creeps up

1594
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,000
cytomegalovirus hhv6 herpes simplex one

1595
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,599
they can you know which is cold source

1596
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,319
they can all creep up shingles can all

1597
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,079
creep up

1598
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:08,079
strep can even creep up right but

1599
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,400
epstein-barr loves to creep up with all

1600
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,880
that

1601
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,640
because it just sits inside of us and

1602
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,200
eventually kind of comes out and creeps

1603
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,000
up

1604
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,839
so i'm going to page 197 i know you guys

1605
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,559
don't have your books yet i wish you had

1606
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,520

um barnes and noble too online

1611
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,079
so right now i'm looking at triggers so

1612
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,119
i'm in the trigger section right here of

1613
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,119
lyme disease and it's really the

1614
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,440
triggers for epstein-barr too

1615
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,400
is there a list of recipes i came in

1616
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,440
late yeah

1617
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,200
there is uh in this book this is packed

1618
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,599
i'm making the spinach soup from this

1619
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,800
book yasmin thank you for coming here

1620
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,480
i really appreciate it so in this

1621
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,800
trigger zone here let's see if i could

1622
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:57,280
find spider bite

1623
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:59,359
so i'm looking right now um

1624
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,119
but yeah so the whole thing is spider

1625
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,920
bite to have it it's number 12 on the

1626
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,520
triggers list

1627
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,960
spider bites are actually much more

1628
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,319
common triggers for lyme disease

1629
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,839
symptoms than tick bites

1630
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,440
accounting for about five percent of

1631
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,559
cases from this list

1632
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,480
all right if the bite leaves some of the

1633
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,160
spider's venom inside your skin an

1634
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,839
infection can result that weakens your

1635
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,240
immune system

1636
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,839
roughly one out of five times it also

1637
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,640
produces a bullseye

1638
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,440
rash okay it can in a lot of people i'm

1639
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,119
reading

1640
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,800
out of the lyme disease chapter right

1641
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:33,520
here and

1642
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:36,400
um so talking about epstein-barr

1643
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:39,119
which is really an epidemic all on its

1644
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,640
own just so you know so

1645
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,559
let's talk about the triggers i got the

1646
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,240
book open i want to show you guys so i

1647
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,440
got a couple of note postage notes in

1648
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,440
here as you can see

1649
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,799
i'm in the trigger section of medical

1650
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,480
medium secrets

1651
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,920
i'm making the spinach soup i still got

1652
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,559
to pour it out and i still have to taste

1653
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,440
it

1654
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,799
so the first trigger right here i have

1655
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,040
here for epstein barr

1656
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:00,799
is the pandemic we're facing now so that

1657
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,280
pandemic that plague we're up against

1658
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,839
now

1659
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,839
is the first trigger the most powerful

1660
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,799
trigger for epstein-barr so everybody's

1661
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,559
epstein bars

1662
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,400
can really get amped up from the

1663
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,880
pandemic virus that's going around right

1664
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,599
now

1665
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,200
so if you happen to contract that virus

1666
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,400
that's creating this pandemic that's

1667
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,079
happening right now then

1668
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,520
you've got a good chance of creeping

1669
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,720
that epstein barr up

1670
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,960
we're actually triggering that

1671
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,200
epstein-barr up so

1672
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,319
okay the current pandemic can challenge

1673
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,119
the immune system

1674
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:33,200
both by exhausting its reserves and by

1675
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,160
causing it to overreact so what happens

1676
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,240
when we get

1677
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,760
sick from the pandemic virus that's

1678
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,000
going around right now

1679
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,200
it can trigger off by literally lowering

1680
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,079
our immune system weakening in our

1681
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,000
immune system

1682
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,839
and making it overreact a weakened

1683
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,720
immune system can in turn provide an

1684
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,960
opportunity

1685
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,559
for dormant viral infections to gain

1686
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,839
strength and create new symptoms so what

1687
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,079
i'm trying to say is

1688
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:56,319
in from what i'm reading here is that if

1689
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,200
you catch that pandemic bug going around

1690
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,599
right now

1691
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,480
right your immune system lowers it

1692
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,079
weakens

1693
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,079
and then any kind of low grade viral

1694
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,319
infection creeps up

1695
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,839
glad you guys are coming on all right

1696
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,599
making spinach soup and reading about

1697
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:13,200
the triggers right here

1698
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,680
and so that's important to know

1699
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,680
okay it can also lead to symptoms that

1700
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,799
someone had previously experienced to

1701
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,760
resurface so if you guys had

1702
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,599
epstein-barr

1703
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,119
if you guys had symptoms of epstein-barr

1704
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,960
maybe not even knew it was epstein-barr

1705
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,760
maybe had tingles and numbness aches and

1706
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,680
pains

1707
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,839
you know um ringing in the ears

1708
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,599
dizziness whatever it is burning skin

1709
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,480
then it's chances are those symptoms

1710
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,720
could come back

1711
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,720
if you get hit with that pandemic bug

1712
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,520
so that's another thing too the pandemic

1713
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,760
virus that's going around now is

1714
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,359
difficult on the central nervous system

1715
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,520
and people who have suffered with

1716
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,240
neurological lyme symptoms are often

1717
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,920
dealing with

1718
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,920
or often dealing with nervous system

1719
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,480
compromises already

1720
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,319
can get triggered by this because hey if

1721
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,160
you get a high fever from the pandemic

1722
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,520
bug that's going around right now that

1723
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,880
can trigger off the neurological

1724
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,280
symptoms of lyme

1725
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,720
if you've already were someone with lyme

1726
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,559
so that's one of the biggest

1727
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,839
triggers right now going on so you got

1728
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,720
all these millions of people out there

1729
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,839
with epstein-barr

1730
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,000
they don't know how to fix their

1731
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,200
epstein-barr they either struggle with

1732
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,400
it they struggle with symptoms and

1733
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,760
conditions that they don't even know

1734
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,960
causes it right

1735
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,079
and what happens is that

1736
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,000
that they're going around with the

1737
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,920
epstein bar they have it in their system

1738
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,160
it's sitting there whether it's causing

1739
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,760
trouble or not in the moment and then

1740
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,680
they end up getting the pandemic bug

1741
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,119
that's happening out there right

1742
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,480
they get hit with that well then that

1743
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,839
weakens the immune system and their

1744
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,680
epstein-barr creeps up

1745
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,680
and now they think it's a pandemic bug

1746
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,280
that's keeping them sick after the fact

1747
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,720
but really now their epstein-barr is

1748
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,040
ignited

1749
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:46,319
and it was published first here in the

1750
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:50,240
medical medium book right

1751
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:53,760
so um there's more information

1752
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:57,359
here to read too so that's one

1753
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:00,000
so just like the flu or the pandemic

1754
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:02,079
bug here now it can prompt that high

1755
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,799
fever which can heat and strain the

1756
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,200
nerves

1757
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,920
that are weakened so if someone recently

1758
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,760
healed

1759
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,960
those nerves can actually weaken from

1760
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,119
the high fever

1761
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,160
okay so the pandemic bug can create that

1762
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,799
high fever

1763
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,799
weaken somebody's nerves who actually

1764
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:18,559
recently healed and now we're back

1765
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,839
in the saddle again of having

1766
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:23,040
neurological lyme

1767
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:25,839
or having hashimoto's or having ra

1768
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,920
or having cfs or having any kind of

1769
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,599
thing any any kind of symptom really

1770
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,359
so many different symptoms so that's how

1771
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,280
it works there um

1772
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,640
so yeah but but i want to talk about

1773
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,640
blood draw extension

1774
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,400
extensive blood draw as a trigger so i'm

1775
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,920
in the trigger section right now

1776
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,440
i'm going to cover that for a minute i'm

1777
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,760
in medical medium if you just came on

1778
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,920
here

1779
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,520
the revised and expanded new edition you

1780
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,040
guys got to check it out it's on amazon

1781
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,640
the link is in description

1782
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,240
you can look at look at that right now

1783
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,440
so here's another trigger you have to

1784
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,200
look out for okay

1785
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,760
this trigger right here is a trigger

1786
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,400
that we get in trouble with all the time

1787
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,280
and we don't realize it it's extensive

1788
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,720
blood draw

1789
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,559
so when you go to your doctor to get

1790
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,520
blood taken so

1791
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:07,359
fasten your seat belts for this okay so

1792
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,839
we get told by our doctor hey

1793
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,359
you need some blood work let's go do it

1794
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,799
you'll be fine all right i need blood

1795
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,920
work because blood work's a good thing

1796
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:17,280
right yeah

1797
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,440
and they end up taking too much blood

1798
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,280
and if you have epstein-barr or you're

1799
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,720
already chronically sick with something

1800
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,040
that's epstein-barr related

1801
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,640
or epstein-barr caused of course like

1802
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,799
cfs or fibro or

1803
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,000
lupus whatever's going on in your life

1804
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:33,040
or just say vertigo

1805
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,400
dizziness focus some anxiety eczema

1806
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,240
psoriasis and you're already dealing

1807
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,680
with all these conditions right

1808
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,359
and then you go to the doctor and you

1809
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,720
get your blood drawn

1810
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:45,440
they end up taking more blood right

1811
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,480
from you than you need really taken from

1812
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,720
you first of all

1813
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,960
it gets thrown away at the la the labs

1814
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,559
so blood labs throw away 95

1815
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,480
of all that blood they take a little

1816
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:58,480
sample out of each vial but

1817
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,000
you end up losing a whole vial right and

1818
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,200
sometimes people get a whole vial and

1819
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,720
they'll take a bunch of things out of

1820
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,559
there do a bunch of tests out of that

1821
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,839
vial but still they throw away half the

1822
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,760
blood easy

1823
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,359
so they'll say hey you need five vials

1824
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,040
of blood you know they come and

1825
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,240
take your blood or you go to a place to

1826
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,839
get your blood taken or you're at the

1827
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,280
doctor's office to get your blood taken

1828
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,400
and they're like what we're taking

1829
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,000
they won't even tell you sometimes

1830
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,359
they'll just take seven vials they'll

1831
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,799
take seven vials

1832
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:24,640
nine vials 12 vials of blood 14

1833
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:26,160
vials of blood i talked about this in

1834
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,520
the past where

1835
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,520
where i've known people they've taken 20

1836
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,920
something vials plus

1837
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,599
and then some people die from that right

1838
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,960
they die literally die from that they

1839
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,720
get too much blood taken

1840
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,640
they weaken they can't recover and they

1841
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,640
get chronically ill and die

1842
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,400
and it all stemmed from that big blood

1843
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,720
draw right

1844
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,520
so i talk about this being a trigger so

1845
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,520
here you are

1846
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,680
you're somebody that is on the edge of

1847
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:54,559
epstein barr or you're on the edge of

1848
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,920
getting a sickness of some kind okay

1849
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,520
you're on the edge of some kind of

1850
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,880
low-grade viral infection like

1851
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,359
epstein-barr

1852
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,000
or shingles and then you get the blood

1853
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,480
draw

1854
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,079
and they take too much blood and what

1855
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:09,440
goes wrong with that

1856
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:11,839
is they remove your immune system so

1857
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,799
epstein-barr stay in us they live in us

1858
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,240
they live in our liver

1859
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,920
they live in our body they live in a lot

1860
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,400
of people's thyroid and they stay

1861
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,920
somewhat dormant they're not really

1862
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,160
causing too much trouble

1863
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,400
they're alive they're inside of us but

1864
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,000
they stay kind of relaxed kind of in a

1865
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,559
docile state

1866
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,119
because your immune system keeps it in

1867
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,599
check

1868
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,040
too so your white count basophils

1869
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,640
monocyte neutrophils are

1870
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,640
keeping it all in check that's what

1871
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,280
happens and

1872
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:41,040
as you're sitting there living your life

1873
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,000
your immune system is trying to stay

1874
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,520
strong

1875
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,599
and it's trying to keep those viruses

1876
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,160
down and then you get a blood test

1877
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:50,319
and they pull out too much blood when

1878
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,240
they pull out too much blood

1879
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:54,400
they end up pulling out your immune

1880
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:56,240
system that was in your blood

1881
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,240
now your immune system doesn't rebuild

1882
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,760
overnight you all of a sudden don't get

1883
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,880
a brand new immune system when they

1884
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,039
removed it

1885
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,240
so when they removed your white count in

1886
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,000
your blood

1887
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,160
that one time they took 10 vials of

1888
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,520
blood and that all that

1889
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:13,760
immune system went into that blood right

1890
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,119
meaning went out of your body in that

1891
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,079
blood right

1892
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,280
then epstein-barr is like wow we got a

1893
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,280
chance to now thrive

1894
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,400
i'm looking for we got a chance to now

1895
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,480
thrive because

1896
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,839
you had all that blood taken out so now

1897
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,319
the epstein barr is like

1898
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:30,079
whoa the immune system's gone right now

1899
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,920
a large part of your immune system that

1900
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,640
was inside your bloodstream

1901
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,160
keeping the virus from causing problems

1902
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,240
is now removed

1903
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,920
and that's why this is a huge trigger

1904
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,200
right here is blood draw

1905
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,520
so what i recommend and i'm going to

1906
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,280
read this section extensive blood draw

1907
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,720
that's a major trigger i'm talking about

1908
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,000
that that's in the medical media book

1909
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,400
right here okay

1910
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,200
when a larger number of blood vials are

1911
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,839
drawn

1912
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,760
it can be stressful on the immune system

1913
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,680
because the very immune defenses that

1914
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,839
are keeping the viruses behind lyme

1915
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,400
symptoms and other chronic illnesses

1916
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,839
the viruses behind lyme and other

1917
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,359
chronic illnesses

1918
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:09,839
the immune system keeps them at bay

1919
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:11,760
and now it's your immune system is being

1920
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:14,960
drawn out of the body

1921
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,960
when the blood is taken

1922
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,200
you guys so i'm in i'm in the lyme

1923
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,200
disease chapter chapter 16

1924
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,400
16 of the book right here medical medium

1925
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,680
just letting you know

1926
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,440
and i'm going to tell you a couple other

1927
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,720
things in a second

1928
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,359
so here's how it goes um larger blood

1929
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,359
draws

1930
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:34,079
tend to take away a substantial portion

1931
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:36,000
of a person's immune system that day

1932
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,599
and it sometimes takes weeks to rebuild

1933
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,280
those portions of the immune system so

1934
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:40,160
here it goes you just had your blood

1935
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,079
taken

1936
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,480
now you need weeks to restore your

1937
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,880
immune system but during those weeks

1938
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,079
epstein-barr creeps up so say you're

1939
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,599
somebody with lyme disease which is

1940
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,359
epstein-barr infection

1941
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,280
and you get all this blood taken all the

1942
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,640
time your lyme doctor is getting all

1943
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,200
ordering all these blood tests you're

1944
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,119
getting all this blood removed right

1945
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,039
i've seen this take people into grave

1946
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,799
places with lyme disease

1947
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:05,119
too much of their immune system is being

1948
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,880
taken out and they decline and they

1949
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,760
decline and they decline over the years

1950
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,280
and decline

1951
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,799
and the very thing that's causing their

1952
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,599
lyme disease epstein-barr

1953
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:15,280
creeps up creeps up creeps up and really

1954
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:18,559
does a number on them

1955
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,319
so okay so that that's important to know

1956
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,920
too

1957
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,359
it can take weeks to rebuild those

1958
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,319
portions of your immune system within

1959
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,319
those weeks that

1960
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,079
that the full power of the immune system

1961
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:29,359
is not present anymore to monitor the

1962
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,880
blood the viruses

1963
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:33,039
can get a window to strengthen and

1964
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,799
proliferate infections can travel from

1965
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,119
organ to organ with ease

1966
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:38,240
that means your viral infection can

1967
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,640
travel from your liver

1968
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,599
to your spleen spleen to your pancreas

1969
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,680
all because

1970
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,200
the doctor's ordering too much blood it

1971
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,720
doesn't even know why you're sick with

1972
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,319
lyme to begin with doesn't know why

1973
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,079
you're sick with some kind of cfs

1974
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,200
doesn't know why you're sick with ra

1975
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,640
doesn't know why you're sick with

1976
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,240
anything hashimoto's and too much

1977
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,720
blood's being ordered

1978
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,480
so that's important to know infections

1979
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,960
can travel from organ organ with ease

1980
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,160
because they're not being corralled

1981
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:06,000
by your immune system right and that can

1982
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,359
lead to a flare-up of symptoms whether a

1983
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,960
week or a few weeks

1984
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:11,119
oh i didn't get my symptoms after i just

1985
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,799
had all my blood taken but you get it

1986
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,240
six months down the road

1987
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:15,680
then you got all these new symptoms six

1988
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,280
months down the road but you don't know

1989
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,960
it's from the blood that was taken six

1990
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,440
months before

1991
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,799
i recommend doing smaller blood draws

1992
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,559
over more visits

1993
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,839
if you're struggling with lyme symptoms

1994
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,920
or any other condition labeled

1995
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:30,880
autoimmune i recommend no more than

1996
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,520
four vials of blood at a time and even

1997
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,720
consider

1998
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,640
fewer if you're very sensitive a mistake

1999
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,240
made by well-meaning doctors is to draw

2000
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,119
a large number of blood vials with

2001
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,280
sensitive people

2002
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,720
that's just one precious piece of

2003
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,480
information

2004
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,000
in this book like when people say well

2005
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,200
why do i need that book like why would i

2006
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
need medical medium

2007
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,160
new addition or anything uh that piece

2008
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,839
of information can save people's lives

2009
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,280
it can save them from years of chronic

2010
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,799
illness it can ha

2011
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,960
it can help them literally get their

2012
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:01,359
lives back just that piece

2013
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,559
so it's like what and this isn't in

2014
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,079
their books you can't find this is

2015
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,599
medical medium information i teach

2016
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,799
doctors this stuff but you can't find

2017
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,799
this in other books

2018
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:10,799
so anyway there's chapters on anxiety

01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,799
crazy and it's packed and um

2028
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,039
so i made some spinach soup i'm gonna

2029
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:36,000
actually pour it into a bowl

2030
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,000
bear with me guys

2031
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,760
miasha he only writes books he could

2032
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:49,599
have created programs instead and change

2033
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,760
hundreds it charged hundreds of

2034
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,319
thousands of dollars for each program

2035
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,880
the books are all under 20 if you can't

2036
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,640
afford

2037
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,000
the book you can go to the library it's

2038
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,440
so true

2039
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,200
i can charge programs two thousand

2040
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,640
dollars three thousand dollars programs

2041
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,359
ten million people around the world

2042
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,799
world will

2043
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:06,480
buy those programs at two thousand

2044
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,079
dollars a piece put the math together

2045
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,599
which ten million times two hundred

2046
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,799
what's ten million times two two

2047
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,359
thousand dollars for three thousand

2048
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,200
dollars

2049
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:14,880
