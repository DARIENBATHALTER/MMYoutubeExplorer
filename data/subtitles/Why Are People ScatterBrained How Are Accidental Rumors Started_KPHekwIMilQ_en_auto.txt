[2.76 - 7.50] here we are again talking about brain
[5.04 - 10.98] saver the brain saver book's gonna read
[7.50 - 12.54] in the chapter called Static brain it's
[10.98 - 14.76] about scatter brains you know anybody
[12.54 - 16.74] who's scatterbrained like you know what
[14.76 - 18.48] are you scatterbrained you hear that a
[16.74 - 20.64] lot right A lot of people have said that
[18.48 - 23.94] over the years that's a term
[20.64 - 25.56] so there's a network of neurons inside
[23.94 - 27.78] your brain
[25.56 - 29.04] that need to be clean and healthy and
[27.78 - 30.74] pure
[29.04 - 34.44] they need to be
[30.74 - 37.26] in good standing so the neurons inside
[34.44 - 39.30] our brain are not supposed to be
[37.26 - 41.70] polluted they're not supposed to be
[39.30 - 44.94] corrupted and polluted and saturated
[41.70 - 48.06] with all kinds of waste and sludge and
[44.94 - 52.62] Gunk and toxins and poisons but what
[48.06 - 56.16] happens is in our lives we have brains
[52.62 - 58.26] that become like a filter and they're
[56.16 - 59.94] saturated with all kinds of toxins
[58.26 - 62.22] poisons all kinds of junk and garbage
[59.94 - 63.72] and waste and everything else byproduct
[62.22 - 66.18] everything right
[63.72 - 68.04] and so our brains have all this stuff in
[66.18 - 70.56] it that's not supposed to be in there
[68.04 - 73.74] and when that stuff is in there and it's
[70.56 - 75.72] saturating the neurons of your brain
[73.74 - 79.94] then all of a sudden we become scatter
[75.72 - 82.62] brains and anything can go wrong even
[79.94 - 84.12] accidental rumors could happen I'm going
[82.62 - 86.34] to read a little bit about that it's so
[84.12 - 87.96] cool in here so this is mind-blowing
[86.34 - 89.52] information you guys
[87.96 - 91.38] the books are on sale right now
[89.52 - 95.10] amazon.com us
[91.38 - 97.38] take advantage of it if you can take
[95.10 - 98.82] advantage of it the very heavy the books
[97.38 - 101.40] good to see you guys again very heavy
[98.82 - 103.98] the books loaded with information and a
[101.40 - 106.32] forewarning to you too there's so much
[103.98 - 109.62] to digest there's so much information to
[106.32 - 111.84] take in it's insane how much line for
[109.62 - 114.30] line it is absolutely incredible and I'm
[111.84 - 117.42] just gonna be I'm just gonna be farting
[114.30 - 119.16] around in your static brain right here
[117.42 - 121.20] and
[119.16 - 123.54] I'm not even talking about the amount of
[121.20 - 125.16] information the anxiety chapter and the
[123.54 - 126.72] Alzheimer's chapter in the bipolar
[125.16 - 129.12] chapter in the OCB chapter and the
[126.72 - 131.28] eating disorder chapter that's just a
[129.12 - 133.56] few things there's symptoms conditions
[131.28 - 135.00] and explanations and incredible
[133.56 - 137.10] information so this is groundbreaking
[135.00 - 139.74] information that's not known out there I
[137.10 - 141.54] want to make that clear because
[139.74 - 143.94] you know I saw somebody earlier make a
[141.54 - 146.94] comment like oh he must be just reading
[143.94 - 150.60] all the latest Neuroscience really that
[146.94 - 152.34] must be a genius or something okay or
[150.60 - 154.08] you know spiritual compassion is a
[152.34 - 156.60] genius or whatever you want to say but
[154.08 - 158.22] this isn't the latest Neuroscience you
[156.60 - 160.02] know Neuroscience doesn't have this
[158.22 - 162.18] information this is far more advanced
[160.02 - 163.62] than our Neuroscience today as far as
[162.18 - 166.62] what's out there
[163.62 - 169.20] and which is incredible so this is
[166.62 - 172.80] Advanced this will become
[169.20 - 175.38] the latest Neuroscience it will because
[172.80 - 178.14] already information for medical medium
[175.38 - 181.26] throughout the last 10 10 years and even
[178.14 - 183.54] before has become Staples in the
[181.26 - 185.40] Neuroscience world and I even talk about
[183.54 - 188.52] some of that in here
[185.40 - 191.40] so about how you know I published it
[188.52 - 193.44] first and whatever so I'm just going in
[191.40 - 195.30] here into static brain the most advanced
[193.44 - 198.66] comprehensive detailed information about
[195.30 - 201.66] how our brain works is in these two
[198.66 - 204.12] books brain saver brain saver protocols
[201.66 - 205.86] so take a look when you get the chance
[204.12 - 207.36] these books are so good Sherry said good
[205.86 - 209.88] to see you these books are so good I'm
[207.36 - 211.80] honored I'm so glad you have the books
[209.88 - 213.42] and let's get into it a little bit you
[211.80 - 216.30] guys
[213.42 - 219.30] so your static brain so I'm on page 10
[216.30 - 222.06] of this massive book
[219.30 - 223.68] and there's two books remember that
[222.06 - 226.62] some of you like which book do I get
[223.68 - 229.32] there's two books they become one big
[226.62 - 231.24] book so I'm in a network of neurons I'm
[229.32 - 234.42] reading right out of here so each line
[231.24 - 236.28] is packed and powerful and filled with
[234.42 - 239.40] information
[236.28 - 242.82] when it comes to your brain
[239.40 - 244.86] neurons mean practically everything
[242.82 - 246.54] healing brain related symptoms and
[244.86 - 248.22] conditions whether those symptoms and
[246.54 - 250.68] conditions are traditionally associated
[248.22 - 252.66] with the brain or not
[250.68 - 254.40] critically depends on understanding the
[252.66 - 257.16] neurons that reside inside of it so if
[254.40 - 258.60] we don't understand our neurons inside
[257.16 - 262.74] our brain
[258.60 - 265.86] we can't heal our brain we cannot heal
[262.74 - 267.96] so if we don't understand our neurons we
[265.86 - 272.24] can't understand what's wrong with us we
[267.96 - 272.24] can't understand our brain it's critical
[272.36 - 278.04] neurons a type of nerve tissue
[275.82 - 280.56] are the means by which communication
[278.04 - 282.72] occurs in the nervous system enabling it
[280.56 - 284.82] to send and receive messages neurons are
[282.72 - 286.68] about input and output so your neurons
[284.82 - 288.72] inside your brain are about information
[286.68 - 290.70] going in information going out
[288.72 - 291.78] information going in information going
[290.70 - 295.92] out
[291.78 - 299.52] neurons are your transcribers
[295.92 - 302.40] that's your transcription method
[299.52 - 304.86] so your neurons are your transcribers to
[302.40 - 308.34] information coming in
[304.86 - 311.76] that's what they are
[308.34 - 313.44] imagine okay
[311.76 - 316.56] imagine
[313.44 - 317.52] billions of tiny people inside your
[316.56 - 319.56] brain
[317.52 - 324.02] can you imagine that
[319.56 - 324.02] billions of tiny people inside our brain
[324.18 - 327.48] each sitting at a desk in front of a
[326.28 - 330.18] computer
[327.48 - 333.00] translating information that's coming in
[330.18 - 336.30] through your ears or eyes or other
[333.00 - 337.68] senses such as smell taste or touch and
[336.30 - 340.32] trying to decipher it so imagine
[337.68 - 343.04] billions of tiny little people inside
[340.32 - 343.04] your brain
[343.50 - 349.02] the neuron transcriber's job is to make
[347.22 - 351.30] sense out of what you're experiencing
[349.02 - 354.00] and then pass that along to the next
[351.30 - 356.60] tiny neuron person inside your brain
[354.00 - 359.96] the hope is that a the information
[356.60 - 363.54] travels uninterrupted and that's the key
[359.96 - 365.76] uninterrupted that's the key so I'm
[363.54 - 370.44] getting someplace right now check this
[365.76 - 370.44] out travels uninterrupted
[373.92 - 378.98] the hope is that a the information
[375.66 - 382.38] travels uninterrupted to that next
[378.98 - 386.28] transcriber neuron
[382.38 - 388.62] and B that next transcriber neuron
[386.28 - 392.10] takes the information that was just
[388.62 - 394.26] deciphered keeps it in purified form and
[392.10 - 396.78] possibly adds an addendum that's
[394.26 - 399.36] efficient and accurate and prepares it
[396.78 - 401.88] for the next tiny person neuron inside
[399.36 - 403.68] your brain to receive
[401.88 - 406.26] so you got this transcriber which is a
[403.68 - 408.24] neuron receiving information through
[406.26 - 410.72] electricity
[408.24 - 413.76] and then
[410.72 - 416.76] transcribing it organizing it and
[413.76 - 420.30] sending it back out if the neurons
[416.76 - 422.40] are not interrupted but everybody's
[420.30 - 424.68] walking around with brain problems
[422.40 - 426.96] everybody's walking around with a brain
[424.68 - 429.42] issue and they're sick in all kinds of
[426.96 - 431.70] different ways so something's getting
[429.42 - 434.84] interrupted something inside their head
[431.70 - 434.84] is getting interrupted
[435.24 - 439.26] aren't these aren't these fun to do you
[437.34 - 443.24] guys
[439.26 - 443.24] so let's let's keep on going here
[443.28 - 449.46] you can imagine
[446.04 - 451.86] your brain as a tiny spaceship
[449.46 - 454.40] so imagine your brain is this tiny
[451.86 - 454.40] spaceship
[454.56 - 459.18] flying through the universe that's
[456.66 - 462.68] pretty cool that's really cool
[459.18 - 465.86] your neurons are billions of tiny aliens
[462.68 - 470.76] inside that spaceship so your neurons
[465.86 - 473.64] are tiny aliens billions of them inside
[470.76 - 475.74] your spaceship right
[473.64 - 478.88] so your brain
[475.74 - 478.88] is a spaceship
[481.92 - 487.86] and you got billions of type poor grogu
[485.34 - 490.08] grow grogu's being used as an example
[487.86 - 493.34] tonight you got billions of tiny little
[490.08 - 493.34] aliens inside your brain
[493.56 - 499.32] and all of these aliens
[496.98 - 501.60] are communicating together
[499.32 - 505.02] at the same time there's a Supreme Being
[501.60 - 508.86] oh whoa whoa whoa at the same time
[505.02 - 512.52] there's a Supreme Being
[508.86 - 514.62] on the ship watching all of it so you
[512.52 - 517.08] got your brain as a spaceship it's got
[514.62 - 518.82] billions of tiny aliens inside of it
[517.08 - 520.98] communicating with each other and
[518.82 - 522.72] there's a supreme being inside that
[520.98 - 525.00] spaceship that's strange
[522.72 - 529.14] what's the Supreme Being inside that
[525.00 - 532.02] spaceship what is it what can it be
[529.14 - 535.50] so you have the Supreme supernatural
[532.02 - 538.56] being that's sitting inside the
[535.50 - 541.50] spaceship watching over all those
[538.56 - 543.54] billions of tiny aliens communicating
[541.50 - 546.72] inside there
[543.54 - 550.46] that Supreme Being is your soul
[546.72 - 550.46] that's your soul
[551.46 - 556.26] your sensory input isn't the only
[554.40 - 557.64] information your neurons decipher and
[556.26 - 561.18] pass along they also translate
[557.64 - 563.52] information about your body processes
[561.18 - 565.26] neurons apply to every single function
[563.52 - 566.46] your body has and how healthy your
[565.26 - 569.34] neurons
[566.46 - 573.12] are determined on how comfortable you're
[569.34 - 575.94] going to be in your mind and body
[573.12 - 578.58] that is neurons are involved you guys
[575.94 - 582.02] got your books I'm on page 12. you guys
[578.58 - 582.02] will probably read it better than I can
[585.12 - 589.32] so
[586.74 - 591.42] that is neurons are involved in both
[589.32 - 594.42] mental functioning and your state of
[591.42 - 597.42] health so neurons involved with your
[594.42 - 599.28] mental health
[597.42 - 602.88] mental health not just physical health
[599.28 - 604.62] mental health and physical health
[602.88 - 606.96] when you have brain related symptoms
[604.62 - 609.06] even on the mildest scale such as mild
[606.96 - 611.10] fatigue and Mild brain fog It's really
[609.06 - 613.44] because neurons can't transfer
[611.10 - 615.06] information properly to the next group
[613.44 - 618.06] of neurons
[615.06 - 620.34] so if you've got brain fog
[618.06 - 622.02] or anything like brain fog It's really
[620.34 - 624.90] because neurons can't transfer
[622.02 - 626.82] information properly to the next group
[624.90 - 629.10] of neurons something is hindering the
[626.82 - 631.26] pathway where the electricity is
[629.10 - 633.06] traveling so as electricity is traveling
[631.26 - 636.96] through your brain something is
[633.06 - 639.60] hindering the passageways the pathway
[636.96 - 641.10] something's in the way he had all these
[639.60 - 642.78] people with brain fog and every kind of
[641.10 - 645.54] problem and all these other issues
[642.78 - 647.70] what's going on something is actually
[645.54 - 651.30] impeding the information traveling
[647.70 - 654.00] across to neuron to neuron
[651.30 - 656.76] something is blocking or otherwise
[654.00 - 660.00] impeding the pathway within the synapsis
[656.76 - 662.46] so the neurons sending out electrical
[660.00 - 664.32] impulses are not reaching other neurons
[662.46 - 665.94] that need the information we're not
[664.32 - 667.74] reaching the neurons as intended so
[665.94 - 668.88] what's happening is you got all these
[667.74 - 672.24] people man
[668.88 - 674.10] she's just walking around
[672.24 - 675.66] they're seeing their psychiatrists their
[674.10 - 677.76] doctors their MDS their functional
[675.66 - 679.98] medicine doctors their therapists their
[677.76 - 682.02] counselors they're depressed they got
[679.98 - 684.72] anxiety they got to personalization they
[682.02 - 686.88] got bipolar diagnoses
[684.72 - 689.16] they got depression in the worst way
[686.88 - 690.72] different ranges they got dementia and
[689.16 - 694.62] Alzheimer's if you want to add those in
[690.72 - 696.48] they got all kinds of different issues
[694.62 - 698.64] they're triggered easy they're emotional
[696.48 - 700.92] emotionally sensitive all these things
[698.64 - 703.02] but there's real problems it's not their
[700.92 - 705.20] fault
[703.02 - 705.20] foreign
[706.44 - 710.22] you can see this in everyday life when
[708.66 - 712.68] you're telling someone a story about
[710.22 - 714.00] apples and they and they find out that
[712.68 - 715.14] the whole time you find out the whole
[714.00 - 716.88] time they thought you were talking about
[715.14 - 719.04] oranges
[716.88 - 719.88] so you're telling somebody a story and
[719.04 - 721.32] you're talking you're talking about
[719.88 - 722.76] apples you're like this apple tree is
[721.32 - 723.96] incredible and then by the time you're
[722.76 - 726.26] done they're like what was that orange
[723.96 - 726.26] tree
[730.14 - 735.42] right any kind of a p impedement within
[733.26 - 737.40] a person's neurons can mean that the
[735.42 - 739.68] information their neurons process gets
[737.40 - 741.66] altered affecting that person's ability
[739.68 - 743.82] to focus listen or properly receive
[741.66 - 745.68] information from a conversation or story
[743.82 - 746.82] so here's how it works you're
[745.68 - 748.02] conversating with somebody you're
[746.82 - 750.30] talking to somebody and you're not
[748.02 - 751.80] getting along like you know
[750.30 - 754.92] something's happening in that
[751.80 - 757.26] relationship something's going wrong no
[754.92 - 758.88] one's seeing eye to eye it could be a
[757.26 - 760.44] couple it could be a relationship could
[758.88 - 762.48] be family members it could be friends
[760.44 - 763.74] but you're not seeing eye to eye it
[762.48 - 765.24] could be somebody you just met on the
[763.74 - 766.80] street but you're not seeing eye to eye
[765.24 - 769.38] and you don't know why you're not seeing
[766.80 - 771.06] eye to eye what is wrong what is going
[769.38 - 772.68] on here
[771.06 - 774.36] there's a good chance it's because that
[772.68 - 776.94] person you're not seeing eye to eye with
[774.36 - 779.16] has got an impedement in the neurons and
[776.94 - 781.76] that information going through is being
[779.16 - 781.76] blocked
[783.06 - 788.04] a lot of people don't actually hear what
[785.64 - 790.32] I said or what's in my books it happens
[788.04 - 794.88] all the time you see it out there people
[790.32 - 797.34] say he didn't say that and I did or
[794.88 - 800.22] he said this and I didn't
[797.34 - 803.40] I've seen that for years on social media
[800.22 - 805.68] people have problems with their neurons
[803.40 - 808.26] and so when they read the medical medium
[805.68 - 809.94] books sometimes they don't it's hard to
[808.26 - 812.88] get the information in I've seen this
[809.94 - 814.44] it's why it's critical to do the cleanup
[812.88 - 815.88] so many people don't read things
[814.44 - 817.38] correctly either or hear things
[815.88 - 819.78] correctly because their neurons are
[817.38 - 822.42] having problems
[819.78 - 823.44] so we have billions of people on this
[822.42 - 827.22] planet
[823.44 - 830.76] and they all got brain problems
[827.22 - 832.44] it's easy to have
[830.76 - 833.70] it's nobody's fault in the end except
[832.44 - 835.74] the industries
[833.70 - 838.98] an evil
[835.74 - 841.62] because they want everybody just
[838.98 - 843.84] scrambled eggs in the brain
[841.62 - 847.26] but what happens is when we get when our
[843.84 - 848.88] brains get too many toxins and poisons
[847.26 - 850.86] and junk and metals and everything else
[848.88 - 853.44] and pathogens and pathogen toxins inside
[850.86 - 854.28] of our brain it becomes this filter and
[853.44 - 857.54] then
[854.28 - 857.54] we get scatterbrained
[857.94 - 864.62] misread initial question guess I need
[860.34 - 864.62] brain saver so that come up
[866.22 - 870.42] Nobody's Perfect
[868.20 - 871.98] Nobody's Perfect
[870.42 - 873.60] there's a lot of people suffering and
[871.98 - 875.88] struggling with their brain and I'd love
[873.60 - 880.10] to see people get better I would love to
[875.88 - 880.10] see them get better so badly
[885.00 - 888.72] then that person may tell someone else
[886.98 - 891.12] in entirely different version of the
[888.72 - 893.16] original story that was told to them
[891.12 - 895.50] you ever had that happen like you tell
[893.16 - 897.48] somebody a story and they change the
[895.50 - 899.52] story as they tell somebody else's Story
[897.48 - 902.10] how crazy is that and it's not that it's
[899.52 - 904.50] crazy it just happens but think about
[902.10 - 906.84] that you tell somebody a story you're
[904.50 - 908.70] like hey look I'm telling you this is
[906.84 - 910.74] what happened I got this this you got
[908.70 - 913.02] this yeah you got that okay great go
[910.74 - 914.10] okay and they go tell somebody and
[913.02 - 916.38] they're telling somebody and they're
[914.10 - 917.94] like you know the the guy had this and
[916.38 - 920.46] he fell off the cliff and next thing you
[917.94 - 923.46] know it he he broke his leg I didn't
[920.46 - 925.62] break my leg I I sprained an ankle but
[923.46 - 927.78] everybody's confused the story go gets
[925.62 - 928.92] passed on down the line and passed down
[927.78 - 931.20] the line
[928.92 - 934.52] and it gets completely
[931.20 - 937.20] right dismantled and
[934.52 - 940.16] deconstructed and reconstructed and it
[937.20 - 940.16] goes on Down the Line
[941.16 - 944.42] Chris it says telephone
[945.96 - 949.34] I'll have to get the telephone
[949.68 - 956.60] this is how gossip and rumors can be
[952.14 - 956.60] twisted and turned into hearsay
[956.70 - 959.66] the game telephone
[959.76 - 963.90] so this is how gossip and rumors can be
[961.86 - 966.60] twisted and turned into hearsay as the
[963.90 - 968.40] story goes from person to person
[966.60 - 970.14] it goes through each person's
[968.40 - 972.30] contaminated impeded blocked or
[970.14 - 973.80] diminished neurons and the story changes
[972.30 - 976.20] dude
[973.80 - 977.88] it goes through everybody's contaminated
[976.20 - 981.30] neurons
[977.88 - 982.92] so the stories changing and it turns
[981.30 - 984.12] into this different story and this
[982.92 - 986.16] different story and this different story
[984.12 - 988.38] and it goes down the line and when it
[986.16 - 990.96] reaches another person
[988.38 - 993.06] it can get twisted up again
[990.96 - 995.34] this can happen on the most basic level
[993.06 - 998.78] and it can happen on even the hierarchy
[995.34 - 998.78] on this planet as well
[1000.20 - 1006.32] people that run this planet
[1003.14 - 1007.70] don't have pure neurons
[1006.32 - 1009.98] where they're
[1007.70 - 1011.78] completely uncorrupted
[1009.98 - 1013.58] they don't have any toxins poisons
[1011.78 - 1015.50] metals and junk and pharmaceuticals and
[1013.58 - 1017.06] everything else in their neurons so when
[1015.50 - 1019.16] they hear the story they get it all
[1017.06 - 1021.80] right
[1019.16 - 1023.84] people that run this world have this
[1021.80 - 1025.34] problem too and what comes out of their
[1023.84 - 1027.08] mouth is all twisted up but the problem
[1025.34 - 1028.52] is everybody pays the price when they
[1027.08 - 1032.56] don't get their stories right and the
[1028.52 - 1032.56] information right crazy how it works
[1033.08 - 1038.18] Matt says definitely need to read
[1035.90 - 1041.78] them and re-read them and reread them
[1038.18 - 1044.44] and reread them one more time incredible
[1041.78 - 1044.44] thank you Matt
[1046.10 - 1052.16] look I've been schooled by Spirit of
[1047.78 - 1054.26] compassion big time on these books
[1052.16 - 1056.96] every single word that went into the
[1054.26 - 1059.30] books SOC would be like
[1056.96 - 1061.04] gotta add this gotta add this you gotta
[1059.30 - 1063.14] add that you got to fix this this is
[1061.04 - 1065.12] what it is this exact word
[1063.14 - 1067.10] and man I was schooled and I had to
[1065.12 - 1068.66] learn
[1067.10 - 1071.26] still learning I have to read the books
[1068.66 - 1071.26] over and over again
[1072.02 - 1075.80] scattered brains
[1074.06 - 1078.02] as electricity travels through an
[1075.80 - 1080.06] impeded neuron system it can become
[1078.02 - 1081.98] diminished meaning that electricity
[1080.06 - 1084.32] within the brain is no longer traveling
[1081.98 - 1085.94] at its full capacity
[1084.32 - 1088.88] so as electricity is running through
[1085.94 - 1091.66] your brain it no longer runs at that
[1088.88 - 1091.66] capacity
[1091.76 - 1095.54] that is a group of neurons can receive a
[1093.98 - 1097.34] fully charged electrical impulse and
[1095.54 - 1100.10] then in the process of assimilating and
[1097.34 - 1101.96] registering that electricity
[1100.10 - 1103.76] which is filled with information and
[1101.96 - 1105.50] sending it through the synapsis to
[1103.76 - 1106.70] another group of neurons electricity can
[1105.50 - 1108.80] be diminished so here's how it goes
[1106.70 - 1110.72] you've got a full power source boom
[1108.80 - 1112.88] electricity you got full electricity
[1110.72 - 1115.34] going through your brain and then it
[1112.88 - 1118.10] hits the contaminated neuron bam and
[1115.34 - 1121.16] then it diminishes
[1118.10 - 1123.02] that's how it works
[1121.16 - 1124.58] you got some electricity to get super
[1123.02 - 1126.50] powered that electricity it's running
[1124.58 - 1129.02] good in here but then it's moving over
[1126.50 - 1130.88] to here you guys it's moving over and as
[1129.02 - 1133.28] it's moving over it hits a contaminated
[1130.88 - 1135.57] part of our brain it goes boom and all
[1133.28 - 1137.42] of a sudden it diminishes
[1135.57 - 1140.66] [Music]
[1137.42 - 1143.60] Mateo Mr Taco says I thought they were
[1140.66 - 1145.76] just extremely extremely emotional
[1143.60 - 1147.56] they're just too emotional that's what
[1145.76 - 1149.72] it is
[1147.56 - 1151.88] go see a counselor you're too emotional
[1149.72 - 1154.10] now there's real problems why we're so
[1151.88 - 1155.48] emotional and when we get hurt
[1154.10 - 1157.10] emotionally listen here's what's
[1155.48 - 1159.50] incredible about the brain saver books
[1157.10 - 1162.46] if you've been hurt emotionally mentally
[1159.50 - 1165.98] like mentally damaged from abuse
[1162.46 - 1169.16] emotional damn emotionally damaged
[1165.98 - 1172.22] from abuse and hardship and loss it does
[1169.16 - 1174.44] something to our brain physically which
[1172.22 - 1176.48] is medical medium information because
[1174.44 - 1178.76] you know Neuroscience doesn't know that
[1176.48 - 1181.16] this is all originally unique
[1178.76 - 1184.34] information in these books
[1181.16 - 1189.56] from first page to the last page
[1184.34 - 1192.74] and our brains can emotionally
[1189.56 - 1194.66] get injured but physically injured from
[1192.74 - 1197.36] an emotional occurrence physically
[1194.66 - 1199.58] injured and then impediment happens and
[1197.36 - 1201.38] then we're sensitive Vivian says oh my
[1199.58 - 1203.66] God yes I have that
[1201.38 - 1205.16] happen in the grocery store I was
[1203.66 - 1207.86] telling a lady something and she
[1205.16 - 1209.78] repeated a whole other story I was
[1207.86 - 1211.76] confused I didn't say anything back to
[1209.78 - 1213.14] her out of respect I never understood
[1211.76 - 1215.60] what happened
[1213.14 - 1217.46] you were talking about apples
[1215.60 - 1219.26] and after you're done and you really
[1217.46 - 1221.00] explained that story probably a really
[1219.26 - 1223.40] great top-notch
[1221.00 - 1224.96] the lady said
[1223.40 - 1227.74] what
[1224.96 - 1227.74] oranges
[1235.16 - 1238.76] foreign
[1236.26 - 1241.48] with electricity is something that's
[1238.76 - 1241.48] mysterious
[1241.58 - 1246.98] and not understood the truth is that
[1244.52 - 1248.84] electricity isn't just electricity so
[1246.98 - 1250.34] medical research in science doesn't know
[1248.84 - 1251.66] that electricity in your brain holds
[1250.34 - 1253.28] information did you guys know that
[1251.66 - 1255.92] that's medical medium information it's
[1253.28 - 1257.90] in the brain saver books they don't know
[1255.92 - 1259.94] they don't know how the brain holds
[1257.90 - 1261.50] information they have no idea
[1259.94 - 1264.26] so research in science the best
[1261.50 - 1266.48] Neuroscience out there does not know how
[1264.26 - 1269.62] your brain holds information like where
[1266.48 - 1269.62] is it they don't know
[1273.40 - 1279.08] the electricity in your brain that's
[1276.80 - 1281.72] swimming around that's flying around and
[1279.08 - 1284.98] rotating is carrying
[1281.72 - 1284.98] the information
[1286.82 - 1290.78] it's information traveling within the
[1288.92 - 1293.18] electricity kind of how we use
[1290.78 - 1294.68] technology today a thought is not just
[1293.18 - 1296.72] something that resides within the
[1294.68 - 1299.00] neurons and glial cells the brain tissue
[1296.72 - 1301.70] and stays there a thought can travel
[1299.00 - 1304.10] with the electricity that leaves a
[1301.70 - 1306.20] neuron electricity can carry tremendous
[1304.10 - 1308.96] amounts of thoughts Ronnie says this is
[1306.20 - 1313.24] brand new information yay thanks
[1308.96 - 1313.24] it is it is the brain saver books
[1316.04 - 1322.22] it's the brain saver books ready ripe
[1319.46 - 1323.66] for poaching from podcast doctors like
[1322.22 - 1324.86] the other books and everything else and
[1323.66 - 1327.56] they won't cite it back to Medical
[1324.86 - 1330.34] medium I know I say that a lot but
[1327.56 - 1330.34] it's sad
[1330.74 - 1333.92] because what's going to happen is
[1332.00 - 1336.74] someone's gonna be like whoa whoa doctor
[1333.92 - 1339.02] podcast guy that was an amazing piece of
[1336.74 - 1341.60] information you must be so smart I'm
[1339.02 - 1344.74] gonna buy your Apple Cider gummies and
[1341.60 - 1347.30] your diatomaceous earth charcoal powder
[1344.74 - 1349.64] you know whatever and all your other
[1347.30 - 1351.74] stuff and your whey protein powder and
[1349.64 - 1354.02] all that because you must be so smart to
[1351.74 - 1356.18] have that advanced information what's
[1354.02 - 1358.34] happening is Dr podcast guy's not saying
[1356.18 - 1361.76] where you got it from so people could
[1358.34 - 1365.14] find out what to avoid and also be
[1361.76 - 1365.14] cautious about at the same time
[1365.36 - 1369.70] I'm trying not to be too snarky today
[1367.28 - 1369.70] you guys
[1370.52 - 1374.30] because the people can't find their way
[1372.50 - 1375.26] back to heal that's why I'm Starkey
[1374.30 - 1378.10] because
[1375.26 - 1378.10] it's sad
[1378.68 - 1384.38] electricity traveling through the brain
[1381.74 - 1386.84] can carry information you won't or don't
[1384.38 - 1388.34] use so electricity going through your
[1386.84 - 1390.02] brain can carry information you're never
[1388.34 - 1392.66] gonna even use you're not even going to
[1390.02 - 1395.18] access man it's there for the taking
[1392.66 - 1397.28] within the electricity so how do we take
[1395.18 - 1399.98] that information out of electricity you
[1397.28 - 1403.28] got electricity going through your brain
[1399.98 - 1405.92] going through and it's information you
[1403.28 - 1408.56] may never use ever ever you're receiving
[1405.92 - 1409.76] but you'll never use it a bird chirps up
[1408.56 - 1411.50] here you're not going to use that
[1409.76 - 1412.82] information a squirrel makes a noise
[1411.50 - 1416.06] over here you're not going to use that
[1412.82 - 1417.02] information of you know an eagle flies
[1416.06 - 1419.00] through the sky you're not going to use
[1417.02 - 1420.56] that information anything going around
[1419.00 - 1421.82] you your brain could be picking up the
[1420.56 - 1424.04] electricity fills up with that
[1421.82 - 1425.06] information a horn blows way over here
[1424.04 - 1427.24] but you're not going to use the
[1425.06 - 1427.24] information
[1429.74 - 1433.82] we're trying to tell someone something
[1431.66 - 1436.94] that we're getting from that electricity
[1433.82 - 1439.16] and at the same time
[1436.94 - 1440.84] leaving out information within that
[1439.16 - 1442.28] electricity as well so here it is you're
[1440.84 - 1444.02] trying to tell somebody like look I
[1442.28 - 1445.28] gotta tell you I'm trying to tell you
[1444.02 - 1447.08] something I'm trying to understand what
[1445.28 - 1448.52] happened happened and electricity has
[1447.08 - 1450.26] all this information and in your brain
[1448.52 - 1451.94] but you can't get all of it out of the
[1450.26 - 1453.32] electricity so you can't even tell the
[1451.94 - 1454.33] person everything you wanted to tell
[1453.32 - 1457.46] them
[1454.33 - 1457.46] [Applause]
[1457.58 - 1461.78] this is extremely Advanced unique
[1459.50 - 1463.58] information so everybody knows I have to
[1461.78 - 1465.56] put that disclaimer out constantly
[1463.58 - 1467.86] someone new could come on here and be
[1465.56 - 1467.86] like oh
[1475.22 - 1479.54] we may feel there was something more to
[1477.44 - 1480.74] say yet we don't know what it really was
[1479.54 - 1481.76] you ever have something on the tip of
[1480.74 - 1483.80] your tongue
[1481.76 - 1486.92] it's on the tip of my tongue
[1483.80 - 1488.78] it's on the tip of my tongue I gotta
[1486.92 - 1491.06] tell you I can't remember what is that I
[1488.78 - 1493.28] was gonna tell you something it was
[1491.06 - 1494.60] there a second ago I have to tell you I
[1493.28 - 1495.98] want to tell you I just don't know what
[1494.60 - 1496.88] it is it'll come later it'll hit me
[1495.98 - 1500.14] later
[1496.88 - 1500.14] maybe it'll hit me later
[1504.62 - 1509.30] it has already passed by us our
[1506.84 - 1511.76] companion may say
[1509.30 - 1514.70] were you going to say something else so
[1511.76 - 1517.58] your friend your partner
[1514.70 - 1519.26] someone that you're talking to
[1517.58 - 1522.02] may say
[1519.26 - 1524.84] were you going to say something else and
[1522.02 - 1526.40] we may reply yeah I was so busy with
[1524.84 - 1527.48] other thoughts I can't remember what it
[1526.40 - 1529.28] was
[1527.48 - 1531.74] that's because you let the electricity
[1529.28 - 1533.42] was harboring the information inside
[1531.74 - 1536.42] your brain was holding on to that
[1533.42 - 1539.36] information inside your brain but you
[1536.42 - 1541.70] couldn't grab it out of there
[1539.36 - 1544.10] we're not having a memory lapse it's
[1541.70 - 1546.14] information that slipped by inside our
[1544.10 - 1549.20] brain's electrical grid that we didn't
[1546.14 - 1551.36] access it's not a memory problem it's
[1549.20 - 1553.76] not like oh God I got a bad memory right
[1551.36 - 1556.76] now I don't know what I was thinking
[1553.76 - 1558.32] Maria Lourdes says it happens to me all
[1556.76 - 1561.32] the time
[1558.32 - 1563.06] it's actually not a memory lapse signs
[1561.32 - 1564.56] of research doesn't know that you're
[1563.06 - 1567.32] losing your memory
[1564.56 - 1569.36] no it's not a memory lapse right there
[1567.32 - 1571.46] in that situation there's tiny nuances
[1569.36 - 1573.86] and detailed information Susan Denise
[1571.46 - 1575.84] says I need every protocol on the book
[1573.86 - 1578.48] good grief bless you Anthony thank you
[1575.84 - 1580.94] for being here
[1578.48 - 1582.32] damage neurons can change thoughts
[1580.94 - 1584.68] altering how someone perceives
[1582.32 - 1584.68] information
[1584.72 - 1590.78] damaged neurons
[1587.42 - 1593.30] can change our thoughts we put our
[1590.78 - 1595.70] perception can go off because of damaged
[1593.30 - 1597.74] neurons Emma says I have been battling
[1595.70 - 1599.54] severe depression for over a decade now
[1597.74 - 1601.88] this knowledge is everything thank you
[1599.54 - 1604.70] for being here
[1601.88 - 1607.34] a monitor here Linda Larkin said thank
[1604.70 - 1608.96] you for these mind-blowing books so glad
[1607.34 - 1611.24] you guys are here I can't wait for you
[1608.96 - 1613.76] guys hold these books in your hands
[1611.24 - 1618.04] you'll feel it when you have them in
[1613.76 - 1618.04] your hands it's really just incredible
[1619.46 - 1623.84] that's because damaged neurons mean
[1621.62 - 1625.82] altered disorganized and poorly
[1623.84 - 1628.16] reorganized electricity so here it goes
[1625.82 - 1631.60] if you have an injured neuron you guys a
[1628.16 - 1635.54] damaged neuron the electricity
[1631.60 - 1637.58] traveling through that neuron is going
[1635.54 - 1640.58] to have scrambled information
[1637.58 - 1640.58] scatterbrains
[1643.10 - 1647.06] as electricity travels through synapsis
[1645.44 - 1649.10] and heads to another group of neurons
[1647.06 - 1651.68] information in that electricity could
[1649.10 - 1653.72] become disorganized before it enters the
[1651.68 - 1655.70] new group of neurons so as you've got
[1653.72 - 1657.98] one group of neurons and electricity
[1655.70 - 1660.92] goes into it it's going to go into a
[1657.98 - 1663.38] whole bunch of of saturated contaminated
[1660.92 - 1665.36] or injured neurons when that electricity
[1663.38 - 1667.40] goes into that batch of saturated
[1665.36 - 1669.74] contaminated neurons
[1667.40 - 1671.12] it's going to get scrambled up so now
[1669.74 - 1673.28] our thoughts
[1671.12 - 1675.32] and our emotions everything and when
[1673.28 - 1677.00] that electricity leaves that batch of
[1675.32 - 1679.04] neurons and heads to another batch of
[1677.00 - 1681.02] neurons it's got different information
[1679.04 - 1681.86] in it meaning it's scrambled up it's
[1681.02 - 1686.92] like
[1681.86 - 1686.92] the brain fog brain fog starts to happen
[1688.40 - 1694.22] won't the previous books address this
[1690.80 - 1696.80] too all the medical medium books
[1694.22 - 1698.90] are incredible books this is all new
[1696.80 - 1700.58] information with even more information
[1698.90 - 1702.44] on the brain packed with brand new
[1700.58 - 1705.26] information
[1702.44 - 1706.16] so that's why all the books are
[1705.26 - 1709.28] important
[1706.16 - 1712.46] often people say you know can I just get
[1709.28 - 1714.08] one book you can look each medical
[1712.46 - 1717.08] meeting book has been life-changing and
[1714.08 - 1720.20] saved countless lives out there but it's
[1717.08 - 1722.48] additional tools and protocols and I'm
[1720.20 - 1724.52] only one human being one little human
[1722.48 - 1725.84] being that
[1724.52 - 1727.94] you know
[1725.84 - 1732.80] can only put the books these books would
[1727.94 - 1735.14] take other I mean this these books
[1732.80 - 1737.24] if someone wanted to write medical books
[1735.14 - 1738.86] with this much information say using
[1737.24 - 1742.04] whatever was out there in the world of
[1738.86 - 1744.68] medicine now it took them five years and
[1742.04 - 1748.04] they would have a team of people citing
[1744.68 - 1749.72] every study and what and I think it
[1748.04 - 1752.18] would take them five ten years to to
[1749.72 - 1753.86] finish a book like this
[1752.18 - 1756.20] it's different in this situation getting
[1753.86 - 1758.54] the information
[1756.20 - 1761.86] both these books you know forget oh
[1758.54 - 1761.86] these books take them 20 years
[1762.92 - 1766.94] but that would be useless information
[1765.98 - 1769.10] thank you
[1766.94 - 1772.30] unlike these books
[1769.10 - 1772.30] okay so let's go
[1773.96 - 1777.44] so it's not just brain tissue that
[1775.64 - 1779.00] Harbors thoughts and controls how we
[1777.44 - 1781.52] feel and how we physically function
[1779.00 - 1783.14] electricity itself also has the power
[1781.52 - 1785.54] over our thoughts and physical control
[1783.14 - 1787.94] but the electricity itself in our brain
[1785.54 - 1789.80] has the power
[1787.94 - 1791.60] that's what's incredible
[1789.80 - 1794.42] it's part of how we can heal because the
[1791.60 - 1796.66] electricity has its own power in our
[1794.42 - 1796.66] brain
[1797.18 - 1801.08] one job of neurons is to eventually pass
[1799.58 - 1802.40] along information to the brain's
[1801.08 - 1804.98] billions of glial cells where
[1802.40 - 1806.24] information stays stored cataloged and
[1804.98 - 1808.46] organized
[1806.24 - 1810.68] the glial cells are clogged contaminated
[1808.46 - 1812.60] saturated distorted or even mutated from
[1810.68 - 1814.82] poisons and toxins a disconnected
[1812.60 - 1816.44] breakdown can occur between your neuron
[1814.82 - 1819.02] system and the glial cell system so when
[1816.44 - 1820.94] your neurons are all messed up
[1819.02 - 1823.04] that's one thing electricity going
[1820.94 - 1825.74] through them with misinformation or
[1823.04 - 1827.48] sorry scrambled up information then if
[1825.74 - 1829.04] they get stored in their glial cells and
[1827.48 - 1830.78] your glial cells are contaminated so
[1829.04 - 1832.70] many people have Metals in their glial
[1830.78 - 1834.50] cells contamination in other glial cells
[1832.70 - 1836.30] then that's a whole nother problem all
[1834.50 - 1838.10] on its own
[1836.30 - 1840.80] I'm only look I'm only reading a
[1838.10 - 1843.56] sentence here sentence there I mean I'm
[1840.80 - 1845.12] still on the same page pretty much this
[1843.56 - 1847.04] page and that page I'm working off I've
[1845.12 - 1849.08] been kind of in between you're
[1847.04 - 1850.94] witnessing history being made these
[1849.08 - 1855.32] books are making history it's the first
[1850.94 - 1858.26] time anyone has put out two books this
[1855.32 - 1860.14] big two books released it once about a
[1858.26 - 1862.52] topic like the brain this is actually
[1860.14 - 1864.20] the most advanced information so you
[1862.52 - 1866.48] guys are witnessing something historic
[1864.20 - 1868.64] right now and maybe no one will care and
[1866.48 - 1871.16] that's okay maybe long after I'm gone
[1868.64 - 1874.04] someone will wake up someday and be like
[1871.16 - 1876.14] that was pretty crazy
[1874.04 - 1878.60] Advanced unique information that science
[1876.14 - 1880.16] has been stealing from they'll dust off
[1878.60 - 1881.54] a book a hundred years from now and be
[1880.16 - 1882.86] like oh my God
[1881.54 - 1885.02] where'd this guy even get this
[1882.86 - 1888.08] information wait it says here he talked
[1885.02 - 1889.82] he talked to some spiritual Force
[1888.08 - 1891.92] read this information it's still
[1889.82 - 1894.92] Advanced 100 years later who was this
[1891.92 - 1897.14] guy let's go find him oh he died it's a
[1894.92 - 1900.34] hundred years later
[1897.14 - 1900.34] let's go dig them up
[1902.54 - 1908.98] find out how he did it
[1905.12 - 1908.98] do some science studies on them
[1912.14 - 1915.80] so much information in here the greatest
[1913.94 - 1917.84] books of all time as I said you guys
[1915.80 - 1920.24] have promised you you will you will feel
[1917.84 - 1923.06] that way and you will like tell someone
[1920.24 - 1924.80] else because they'll read it and be like
[1923.06 - 1927.44] oh my God what is this and you'll be
[1924.80 - 1929.78] like it's the greatest books of all time
[1927.44 - 1932.00] I have I have uh some personal friends
[1929.78 - 1935.78] just like this is these are the greatest
[1932.00 - 1936.68] books I mean and I can say and I could
[1935.78 - 1938.72] judge it
[1936.68 - 1940.40] because the information came down from
[1938.72 - 1941.72] above and I could say okay these are
[1940.40 - 1943.58] incredible books these are going to heal
[1941.72 - 1945.38] people and change their lives
[1943.58 - 1946.82] but these
[1945.38 - 1948.62] is just
[1946.82 - 1952.46] whoa
[1948.62 - 1954.08] we just got to another level
[1952.46 - 1956.66] these are the greatest books in health
[1954.08 - 1958.58] of all time there won't be a podcast
[1956.66 - 1960.62] doctor a Health Doctor a health
[1958.58 - 1963.14] influencer anybody that can put out
[1960.62 - 1965.72] books like these with information like
[1963.14 - 1967.46] this it never happened before it never
[1965.72 - 1969.58] did you just got to eat better books out
[1967.46 - 1972.80] there medical medium books are are
[1969.58 - 1975.20] really Advanced information right with
[1972.80 - 1978.16] people healing but these books here
[1975.20 - 1978.16] exactly
[1978.32 - 1983.74] that Jill said the goat
[1980.66 - 1983.74] the goat
[1984.80 - 1990.70] greatest books of all time and Beyond
[1987.38 - 1990.70] Marissa spiritual son
[1996.44 - 2001.26] so misunderstanding the brain's needs
[1998.96 - 2003.52] doesn't stop at trick supplements
[2001.26 - 2005.70] everybody's an expert these days in
[2003.52 - 2008.38] brain hacks you notice that
[2005.70 - 2010.12] telomeres telomeres
[2008.38 - 2015.58] oh
[2010.12 - 2017.74] I I actually went to a neuroscience
[2015.58 - 2019.66] event and I saw people talking about
[2017.74 - 2020.92] telomeres I went on the stage and I did
[2019.66 - 2023.52] a whole thing about genetics and
[2020.92 - 2023.52] telomeres
[2024.82 - 2028.08] kind of a glass of wine
[2028.60 - 2035.20] I was in Napa Valley I had a glass of
[2031.60 - 2037.12] wine it was 52 000 a glass it was a
[2035.20 - 2039.34] perfect price
[2037.12 - 2041.86] I'm gonna buy the vineyard with a bunch
[2039.34 - 2043.42] of doctor friends
[2041.86 - 2045.40] all right
[2043.42 - 2047.98] everybody's an expert these days in
[2045.40 - 2049.78] brain hacks it's often about how to
[2047.98 - 2052.36] master our mind you notice that it's
[2049.78 - 2054.64] like master your mind man that's what it
[2052.36 - 2056.80] is spend your life mastering your mind
[2054.64 - 2058.78] and then boom your triggered back into
[2056.80 - 2060.52] it I gotta Master my mind again I gotta
[2058.78 - 2062.14] do another course another course I gotta
[2060.52 - 2065.02] figure it out I gotta figure out how to
[2062.14 - 2067.66] like fix this rewire do whatever
[2065.02 - 2070.30] I gotta do something and I'm not ripping
[2067.66 - 2072.28] apart all that any tools we can get are
[2070.30 - 2075.40] helpful to get us to manage and get by
[2072.28 - 2077.20] but the problem is is how do we fix it
[2075.40 - 2079.42] though how do we actually fix a problem
[2077.20 - 2083.52] so we get rid of depersonalization by
[2079.42 - 2086.86] polar anxiety panic attacks depression
[2083.52 - 2090.10] anything how do we fix it I want to fix
[2086.86 - 2092.74] fix Jeanette says internet on YouTube
[2090.10 - 2094.60] unknown Angels please help our best
[2092.74 - 2097.06] friend Anthony William to survive the
[2094.60 - 2099.82] haters thieves in betrayers the most
[2097.06 - 2103.12] underappreciated man in America again no
[2099.82 - 2105.28] respect that's actually really funny
[2103.12 - 2108.22] thank you by the way Jeanette
[2105.28 - 2111.34] it made me laugh Allison podcast doctors
[2108.22 - 2112.30] won't know what hit them yeah I know
[2111.34 - 2114.58] well you know what it is they're going
[2112.30 - 2117.10] to hear about the books Non-Stop
[2114.58 - 2118.78] from everybody that's how it works it's
[2117.10 - 2120.34] just gonna drive them insane then they
[2118.78 - 2123.88] go and grab the book and then they go
[2120.34 - 2126.52] whoa I gotta use that in my podcast
[2123.88 - 2128.14] or I gotta invite somebody on there who
[2126.52 - 2130.36] took it from the book and they'll act
[2128.14 - 2132.64] like it's theirs
[2130.36 - 2134.44] it's not even mine it's from above let's
[2132.64 - 2136.24] respect that and say where it comes from
[2134.44 - 2138.28] I'm the messenger
[2136.24 - 2140.94] and let's get people to the book so they
[2138.28 - 2140.94] can heal right
[2143.56 - 2148.38] some of these strategies are how we
[2145.60 - 2148.38] think right
[2150.82 - 2154.96] I have been doing your protocols for the
[2153.04 - 2157.96] last four years and my husband has only
[2154.96 - 2160.60] jumped on board this week yeah you are
[2157.96 - 2164.64] getting your information out amazing
[2160.60 - 2164.64] tell them I said hi please
[2165.28 - 2168.76] it's often about how we trick our
[2167.08 - 2170.56] thoughts and perceptions trying to
[2168.76 - 2171.88] better our lives with how we think right
[2170.56 - 2173.56] when we're trying to master our mind
[2171.88 - 2175.90] some of these strategies are positive
[2173.56 - 2177.88] see I'm being positive I'm not being
[2175.90 - 2179.50] sarcastic right there
[2177.88 - 2181.00] I know everybody's trying to hack their
[2179.50 - 2182.44] brains with some kind of technique and
[2181.00 - 2184.84] stuff and I'm being positive I'm not
[2182.44 - 2186.46] being negative about it it's often about
[2184.84 - 2187.48] how we trick our thoughts you know
[2186.46 - 2189.64] everybody's trying to trick their
[2187.48 - 2191.68] thoughts trick them trick them out of
[2189.64 - 2193.06] something right and perceptions trying
[2191.68 - 2194.74] to better our lives with how we think
[2193.06 - 2196.84] some of these strategies are positive
[2194.74 - 2199.18] and can be very helpful temporarily
[2196.84 - 2202.06] because I don't mind trying to manage I
[2199.18 - 2204.16] want people to be able to manage
[2202.06 - 2206.08] if you're doing stitches and patching up
[2204.16 - 2207.82] some emotional physical conditions in
[2206.08 - 2209.38] some situations you have to manage it
[2207.82 - 2210.88] then you've got to use these hacks they
[2209.38 - 2212.92] still don't get to the root of why we're
[2210.88 - 2214.90] struggling I want to get to the root of
[2212.92 - 2217.78] why I wish why we're struggling and I
[2214.90 - 2219.94] said to SOC I want to get to the root I
[2217.78 - 2221.98] need to know why everybody's suffering
[2219.94 - 2224.50] and the spiritual bachelor's like yes
[2221.98 - 2226.06] that's why we're here doing this and
[2224.50 - 2229.36] it's in here
[2226.06 - 2231.76] it's not about managing and hacks
[2229.36 - 2233.32] Michelle oh I've heard doctors say they
[2231.76 - 2235.60] already knew medical medium information
[2233.32 - 2237.34] laugh out loud really because you've
[2235.60 - 2238.90] been around for a long time in the
[2237.34 - 2241.86] health field I know a lot of other
[2238.90 - 2244.72] people that have too and nothing existed
[2241.86 - 2246.82] literally medical media book one when it
[2244.72 - 2249.64] came out
[2246.82 - 2252.46] all original unique
[2249.64 - 2255.28] and brand new and everybody knew it and
[2252.46 - 2257.98] there wasn't one paper one study one
[2255.28 - 2259.80] doctor that knew any of it and this is
[2257.98 - 2263.14] eight years ago
[2259.80 - 2264.88] and millions see the little gold emblem
[2263.14 - 2267.10] there millions of these copies got
[2264.88 - 2270.12] around the world and in every doctor's
[2267.10 - 2270.12] office and everything else
[2278.50 - 2283.38] so we're in here we're talking about
[2280.66 - 2283.38] some good stuff
[2283.96 - 2287.62] with these thought techniques out there
[2286.00 - 2289.78] eat listen you will witness it again
[2287.62 - 2292.42] with these books
[2289.78 - 2294.46] and my new podcast episodes you're gonna
[2292.42 - 2296.44] witness history being made again with
[2294.46 - 2298.84] new information over again like the
[2296.44 - 2302.32] blood draw information you guys
[2298.84 - 2304.18] I mean it was just absolutely incredible
[2302.32 - 2307.12] to blood draw information
[2304.18 - 2310.62] and I go into real epic detail about
