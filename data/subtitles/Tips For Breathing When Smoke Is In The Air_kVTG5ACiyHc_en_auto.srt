1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,200
when there's smoke in the air because of

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,480
the LA fires right now things really bad

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,200
for a lot of people I mean it's

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,960
devastating I'm sure you guys have seen

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,960
it out there people losing their homes

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,080
people losing their Farms their

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,000
businesses their family's homes their

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,359
apartment buildings they're losing their

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,480
places to live I just wanted to come on

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,599
here just uh for a couple of tips number

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,400
one one of the big things is because the

12
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,320
air is so dry the Ash and the air it

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,079
just cuts through it just gets into the

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,520
lungs really easily and I think that's

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,160
really hard for a lot of people one of

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
the things that you can do is you can

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,600
wear like an n95 mask it's going to help

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,559
a little bit I mean it's obviously not

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,480
going to protect you with flames and

20
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,960
heavy heavy smoke so if you're exposed

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,320
and you're out of your house and so

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,079
forth one thing you can do is you take a

23
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,039
towel like this and I've said this

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,480
before with other fires over the years

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,039
but you take a towel and you moisten it

26
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,840
so this is really important right here

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,359
you moisten it I'm squeezing out the

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,960
water and you breathe through the towel

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,760
a moist towel that's important you can

30
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,680
actually make it as thin as you want you

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,799
can double it up depending on how it

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,560
feels you can do this too you can hold

33
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,280
it just like this and you can put it

34
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,360
over your face and you can breathe

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,759
through it so what happens is the water

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,560
is what catches a lot of the toxins a

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,280
lot of that dust a lot of the ashes if

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
you're moving around you get a couple of

39
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,640
towels like that you keep them moist and

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,159
damp now there's this packet I don't

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,479
know if you've had this before it's a

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,720
medical medium tool book right here okay

43
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,360
environmental disaster a quality tools

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,640
including some air cleaners that are the

45
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,840
best ones other tools too

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,000
supplementation you know for after the

47
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,119
fact as well you get some place you're

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,040
able or things start coming down got to

build your immune system back up after

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,399
getting everything cuz when it goes into

51
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,799
the lungs and it goes into the

52
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,479
bloodstream what happens with chronic

53
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,360
illness when people have chronic illness

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,880
it could be a trigger all those toxins

55
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,560
all those poisons floating around Metals

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,920
