[3.44 - 10.00] today I'm answering health questions but
[6.00 - 11.52] I have an update for you now you know
[10.00 - 12.84] there's something happening September
[11.52 - 14.92] 7th at
[12.84 - 18.64] aan right it's going to be a meet and
[14.92 - 21.00] greet and I'm going to be there but like
[18.64 - 24.04] medical medium fashion goes it is
[21.00 - 27.96] turning into to be something into a
[24.04 - 30.72] bigger thing and a more crazier thing so
[27.96 - 32.24] now it's not just a meat and greet like
[30.72 - 34.16] originally I was keeping it lowkey and I
[32.24 - 37.16] was like hey that's okay we'll do a meet
[34.16 - 40.08] and greet some people will come but a
[37.16 - 43.20] lot of requests a lot of people want to
[40.08 - 45.80] come and now I'm pulling my hair out and
[43.20 - 48.44] I'm just like what is going on so now
[45.80 - 50.04] it's going to be a little bit different
[48.44 - 52.76] like an
[50.04 - 56.64] Afterparty an Afterparty so September
[52.76 - 59.00] 7th airan the commemorative customized
[56.64 - 60.60] medical medium heavy metal detox
[59.00 - 62.04] smoothie bottle which I want to talk
[60.60 - 65.32] about for a second before we answer
[62.04 - 68.16] questions that smoothie bottle is why
[65.32 - 70.88] I'm going to be there because it's going
[68.16 - 72.88] to be this like one time only customized
[70.88 - 74.48] smoothie bottle medical medium glass
[72.88 - 76.32] bottle that's a collector's item in the
[74.48 - 77.84] whole bit which is really incredible
[76.32 - 80.56] because the heavy metal detox smoothie
[77.84 - 83.76] did so well there they want to put it
[80.56 - 86.20] there every day fresh made every morning
[83.76 - 88.44] in the refrigerator section made fresh
[86.20 - 90.92] in that glass bottle but here's the
[88.44 - 93.84] here's the problem here
[90.92 - 95.92] that customized glass bottle they're
[93.84 - 98.60] only making so many of them until they
[95.92 - 101.16] move it into the like a normal medical
[98.60 - 103.80] medium bottle right the customized
[101.16 - 105.08] collector's bottle you might you might
[103.80 - 106.60] want to look out for the email that
[105.08 - 108.40] we'll be sending out if you're coming
[106.60 - 110.48] because you need to pre-order it you
[108.40 - 111.96] should pre-order it so you get one is
[110.48 - 115.04] what I'm saying cuz this is going to be
[111.96 - 116.96] a really cool legendary bottle and you
[115.04 - 118.52] might want to actually be there to
[116.96 - 120.20] pre-order you want to pre-order it so

[758.48 - 764.96] s so clearly nature says where do you
[761.72 - 766.80] start with MCAS and you're reacting to
[764.96 - 769.80] almost all
[766.80 - 772.40] foods including most of the healing
[769.80 - 776.12] foods I was doing great with medical
[772.40 - 780.48] medium and then um C rocked my world
[776.12 - 781.72] with chronic shingles and MC s you know
[780.48 - 785.80] with
[781.72 - 788.04] okay you know what happens is that if C
[785.80 - 790.04] rocked your world if you guys know what
[788.04 - 792.32] I mean by C because even though
[790.04 - 794.84] everybody's saying the word they're all
[792.32 - 796.96] saying the word you know vovid vovid
[794.84 - 798.92] vovid you know the word vovid vovid
[796.96 - 801.52] they're always saying vovid vovid vovid
[798.92 - 804.24] everybody's on the internet saying v v v
[801.52 - 806.12] they're all saying that word right okay
[804.24 - 808.20] do you see I'm not really saying that
[806.12 - 809.68] word because they have nothing to worry
[808.20 - 811.68] about but I do
[809.68 - 814.24] I do have something to worry about even
[811.68 - 816.24] though it's everywhere it's on all the
[814.24 - 819.44] platforms and everybody V it V it it's
[816.24 - 823.44] old news old news I still have to like
[819.44 - 825.40] be careful and not see that word it's
[823.44 - 827.88] crazy so back to the
[825.40 - 831.36] Sea what happens with the sea is when
[827.88 - 834.48] that sea finally dies off it can linger
[831.36 - 837.28] in people too by the way and when it
[834.48 - 839.40] finally dies off it produces a
[837.28 - 841.20] tremendous amount of toxin if you're
[839.40 - 843.64] somebody that's already chemical
[841.20 - 844.76] sensitive and you're food sensitive and
[843.64 - 847.08] this is important you guys if you're
[844.76 - 849.44] food sensitive chemical sensitive
[847.08 - 851.32] supplement sensitive you know with
[849.44 - 852.56] anything you're just sensitive with
[851.32 - 854.44] anything and everything and you don't
[852.56 - 856.64] even know what why you're reacting or
[854.44 - 859.08] where you're reacting and how it
[856.64 - 862.72] works if you're somebody doing that and
[859.08 - 866.44] you get C
[862.72 - 868.88] bid and you get C what happens is though
[866.44 - 870.84] c not only lowers the immune system cuz
[868.88 - 872.44] it it it's in the body the immune
[870.84 - 874.24] system's trying to get rid of it it's
[872.44 - 876.40] trying to destroy it and the SE is
[874.24 - 879.72] creating all this trouble right just
[876.40 - 882.08] like the flu the flu does the same thing
[879.72 - 884.76] it really creates a lot of problems it
[882.08 - 890.36] breaks down the immune system but what
[884.76 - 892.08] the flu and vit do and rs you know V and
[890.36 - 895.88] all this what it
[892.08 - 897.56] does is it produces poison and if you're
[895.88 - 898.68] already chemical sensitive and you're
[897.56 - 900.08] you've been recovering so you're
[898.68 - 902.00] chemical sensitive person and you've
[900.08 - 904.04] been recovering and you're doing good
[902.00 - 906.80] and you're moving up the ladder and then
[904.04 - 908.56] boom vit kicks you back knocks you back
[906.80 - 911.20] a little bit Boom the flu knocks you
[908.56 - 913.72] back a little bit boom RSV knocks you
[911.20 - 916.52] back a little bit and lowers your your
[913.72 - 920.16] immune system it's also going to produce
[916.52 - 922.24] all this toxin tons of toxin it's going
[920.16 - 924.72] to produce produce produce while it's
[922.24 - 927.44] being killed too so as your immune
[924.72 - 929.96] system's killing it it's going to
[927.44 - 932.40] produce poison and toxin and when it
[929.96 - 934.36] does that you're going to be more
[932.40 - 937.04] chemical sensitive more supplement
[934.36 - 938.84] sensitive more food sensitive more
[937.04 - 940.96] sensitive more you know chemical
[938.84 - 942.08] sensitive in the air sensitive for all
[940.96 - 946.04] these other
[942.08 - 948.36] reasons then because the sea the volid
[946.04 - 950.60] knocked your immune system down because
[948.36 - 953.80] RSV flu whatever knocked your immune
[950.60 - 956.12] system down then the shingles Rises up
[953.80 - 958.36] and now the shingles is moving up now
[956.12 - 960.52] the herpes simplex one the cold sores
[958.36 - 963.16] are popping out everywhere and then you
[960.52 - 965.56] know herp Simplex two genital sores
[963.16 - 967.52] popping out everywhere down here then
[965.56 - 969.08] you know it's not just that and you know
[967.52 - 971.32] next thing you know an epscene bar
[969.08 - 973.40] starts to come up creeping up giving you
[971.32 - 975.96] the chronic fatigue again next thing you
[973.40 - 978.40] know the shingles you get a swash of
[975.96 - 981.16] shingles here a swash of shingles here a
[978.40 - 984.48] swash of shingles here or you get
[981.16 - 986.84] shingles pain and nerve pain without
[984.48 - 990.48] having the actual rash right all this
[986.84 - 993.92] comes up because the flu and RSV and the
[990.48 - 996.28] vulet all knocked down all knocked down
[993.92 - 998.60] the immune system but produced a lot of
[996.28 - 1000.64] poison too and when it produced a lot of
[998.60 - 1002.60] poison you're now chemical sensitive
[1000.64 - 1004.16] again you're now you're now supplement
[1002.60 - 1006.12] sensitive you're now food sensitive you
[1004.16 - 1008.32] don't know what to eat to do or what and
[1006.12 - 1010.84] then on top of it if shingles started
[1008.32 - 1013.36] rising up and shingles started coming up
[1010.84 - 1015.00] and you know um cyto virus started
[1013.36 - 1017.28] coming up your herpes simplex one
[1015.00 - 1019.00] started coming up started rising up cuz
[1017.28 - 1021.36] your immune system was down kicked down
[1019.00 - 1023.28] by vet kick down by flu whatever you
[1021.36 - 1025.64] kick down by the sea what happens is
[1023.28 - 1027.36] that you're as things are go getting
[1025.64 - 1028.88] stronger like the the shingles and
[1027.36 - 1031.16] everything and Epstein bars and all
[1028.88 - 1033.24] that's getting
[1031.16 - 1035.12] stronger then that's producing more
[1033.24 - 1036.76] neurotoxin and more neurotoxin and more
[1035.12 - 1038.64] neurotoxin now once again now you're
[1036.76 - 1040.40] like crap not only am I chemical
[1038.64 - 1043.40] sensitive supplement sensitive food
[1040.40 - 1045.08] sensitive but now I'm really feeling
[1043.40 - 1046.40] like wow out of whack and I don't know
[1045.08 - 1048.20] what's going on I feel like I'm out of
[1046.40 - 1050.40] whack so what happens is when that
[1048.20 - 1052.48] shingles and those herpe viruses those
[1050.40 - 1054.40] the herpetic family starts to rise up
[1052.48 - 1056.24] and you got low grade infections and
[1054.40 - 1057.68] they're rising up now they're producing
[1056.24 - 1058.92] all this neurotoxin and now you're back
[1057.68 - 1060.24] in the saddle again with this whole
[1058.92 - 1062.04] thing and you're just like oh my God
[1060.24 - 1064.52] what is this I'm back to being sensitive
[1062.04 - 1066.44] again that's how it works but but but
[1064.52 - 1072.60] but but have no
[1066.44 - 1075.68] fear with time and caring learning
[1072.60 - 1078.84] protocols right learning
[1075.68 - 1081.08] protocols so many of them suppl
[1078.84 - 1084.00] mentation protocols and so forth and all
[1081.08 - 1086.16] of that you start fixing things as I
[1084.00 - 1087.96] throw these books all around everywhere
[1086.16 - 1090.32] when you're learning what to do you're
[1087.96 - 1092.52] learning how to rebuild the immune
[1090.32 - 1096.44] system that's total immune right there
[1092.52 - 1098.36] every day every day it's like who's
[1096.44 - 1100.00] reaching out okay it's a cousin okay
[1098.36 - 1101.40] yeah what's going on what's going on are
[1100.00 - 1103.36] you are you doing something for your
[1101.40 - 1106.48] immune system are you doing total immune
[1103.36 - 1108.52] every day it's like someone's calling me
[1106.48 - 1111.20] you know family and so forth or an old
[1108.52 - 1113.20] friend is like what aw what do I do you
[1111.20 - 1115.24] know I caught this I caught that my
[1113.20 - 1116.76] immune system's really low and that's
[1115.24 - 1118.00] the total immune by the way do you guys
[1116.76 - 1120.92] know I'll just show you this really
[1118.00 - 1123.52] quick no big deal it's total immune
[1120.92 - 1126.20] that's by viy V is and Victor i m is and
[1123.52 - 1127.92] Mary E RG y okay you guys know I work

[1155.16 - 1160.36] guys with them anyway that's the total
[1157.32 - 1162.68] immune and we're going into the fall
[1160.36 - 1164.68] we're going into the fall that's total
[1162.68 - 1166.80] immune right from bgy right there so
[1164.68 - 1170.08] check that
[1166.80 - 1172.20] out but have no fear there's ways to
[1170.08 - 1173.48] build up your immune system there's ways
[1172.20 - 1176.24] to lower the
[1173.48 - 1178.72] neurotoxic rate there's ways of
[1176.24 - 1180.80] recovering the SI the body system
[1178.72 - 1182.28] lymphatic system the nervous system
[1180.80 - 1186.52] right cardiovascular system whatever it
[1182.28 - 1188.92] is there's ways of recovering your body
[1186.52 - 1190.80] systems and then you're less sensitive
[1188.92 - 1193.56] less chemical sensitive less food
[1190.80 - 1195.44] sensitive less supplement sensitive out
[1193.56 - 1197.64] there in a whole bit a lot of people are
[1195.44 - 1200.68] supplement sensitive because they did
[1197.64 - 1203.92] the swallowing all the charcoal years
[1200.68 - 1206.68] ago they did crazy liver flushes with
[1203.92 - 1208.72] all the olive oil can't even tell you
[1206.68 - 1211.84] how stupid that is it's unbelievable
[1208.72 - 1214.48] what people have done out there okay
[1211.84 - 1215.92] okay and that's the thing with a lot of
[1214.48 - 1218.72] people they've tried they've done all
[1215.92 - 1220.92] the fish oil gobbling down the fish oil
[1218.72 - 1222.80] every day for so long they've done
[1220.92 - 1224.68] garbage bulk
[1222.80 - 1226.64] multivitamins with all kinds of
[1224.68 - 1228.76] magnesium sterate and everything else
[1226.64 - 1232.24] Under the Sun in it they've done a lot
[1228.76 - 1234.32] of stuff that hindered their system
[1232.24 - 1235.72] weakened their system made them
[1234.32 - 1237.08] sensitive and that's a whole thing that
[1235.72 - 1238.20] people don't realize when it comes down
[1237.08 - 1240.68] to supplement
[1238.20 - 1244.80] sensitivities cor over there on YouTube
[1240.68 - 1250.04] says I used to do ACV shots now I know
[1244.80 - 1252.64] it it pains me pains me if I look online
[1250.04 - 1255.24] for a minute and I'm looking on YouTube
[1252.64 - 1256.96] for a second and then you see like an ad
[1255.24 - 1259.04] come up with some like nutritionist
[1256.96 - 1261.44] that's like here's the best way to help
[1259.04 - 1263.36] your stomach problem or the best way for
[1261.44 - 1265.88] your health it's doing this and they
[1263.36 - 1268.00] take a apple cider vinegar put two
[1265.88 - 1269.76] tablespoons of Apple Cedar vinegar put
[1268.00 - 1272.48] lemon in there of course medical medium
[1269.76 - 1274.28] stuff Le put lemon in there and put a
[1272.48 - 1276.84] little bit of cayenne pepper in there
[1274.28 - 1278.48] too and mix it up and you take this
[1276.84 - 1279.96] every day and then the media comes along
[1278.48 - 1281.92] it's like we'll do an article on you
[1279.96 - 1283.64] because you're such a smart nutritionist
[1281.92 - 1285.80] it's like meanwhile that apple centa
[1283.64 - 1287.88] vinegar will rot your teeth out they
[1285.80 - 1289.48] will fall apart down the road and you'll
[1287.88 - 1291.56] be getting the whole veneers and
[1289.48 - 1293.60] everything else and all that stuff it's
[1291.56 - 1296.96] crazy what happens and the apple cided
[1293.60 - 1299.80] vinegar destroys gut balance everybody's
[1296.96 - 1301.40] like microbiome microbiome it's like
[1299.80 - 1304.20] another microbiome doctor another
[1301.40 - 1306.08] microbiome microbiome microbiome you
[1304.20 - 1310.40] want to destroy your microbiome do the
[1306.08 - 1315.80] ACV destroys it anyway so very important
[1310.40 - 1318.24] to know vinegars are so bad on your
[1315.80 - 1320.20] system but when people do all those
[1318.24 - 1321.76] kinds of things they get sensitive later
[1320.20 - 1323.40] they can get more chemical sensitive
[1321.76 - 1326.76] they can get more food sensitive and
[1323.40 - 1330.68] supplement sensitive yes it's it's so
[1326.76 - 1332.96] true blooding soil Shield Maiden that is
[1330.68 - 1336.20] a really cool handle where can I buy
[1332.96 - 1339.00] your books audio books go to Amazon go

[1345.80 - 1349.40] them there medical medium books most
[1347.96 - 1352.52] bookstores too you can walk in
[1349.40 - 1355.00] bookstores they're out there which is
[1352.52 - 1357.72] incredible thanks to my publisher
[1355.00 - 1360.32] they're in bookstores around the world
[1357.72 - 1363.16] and um and that that's been a blessing
[1360.32 - 1365.96] to get them out there best way to get
[1363.16 - 1368.20] rid of chronic sinus in my head and eyes
[1365.96 - 1371.56] learning what understanding what chronic
[1368.20 - 1374.56] sinus means like what is it you know if
[1371.56 - 1377.88] you weren't diagnosed with a pup in your
[1374.56 - 1380.04] in your sinus cavity or something else
[1377.88 - 1382.48] or maybe you're dealing with scar tissue
[1380.04 - 1384.76] in your sinus cavity you know how did it
[1382.48 - 1387.64] get there what happened what's going on
[1384.76 - 1390.80] with sinuses why are you having a
[1387.64 - 1394.00] post-nasal drip why are you having
[1390.80 - 1397.28] sinusitis right so learning key pieces
[1394.00 - 1399.64] to all of that and you know when I tell
[1397.28 - 1401.52] doctor friends that come to me and
[1399.64 - 1403.12] doctors that try to reach out to me I
[1401.52 - 1404.40] talked to one recently by the way just
[1403.12 - 1406.24] recing about all kinds of different
[1404.40 - 1410.00] things I didn't talk about sinusitis but
[1406.24 - 1413.28] we talked about UTI and stuff and it's
[1410.00 - 1415.80] important to know what sinusitis is that
[1413.28 - 1418.72] right there when the doctor doesn't know
[1415.80 - 1421.04] what it is when the doctor doesn't know
[1418.72 - 1423.92] why you have sinus sinusitis right they
[1421.04 - 1427.00] just don't know a lot of people will
[1423.92 - 1429.84] have bacteria that is Strep so the whole
[1427.00 - 1433.08] strep family right strep bacteria
[1429.84 - 1436.56] creates a sinusitis it creates UTI
[1433.08 - 1439.00] conjunctive vitis it creates acne it
[1436.56 - 1442.68] creates sore throats it creates ear
[1439.00 - 1444.88] infections it creates otitis media it
[1442.68 - 1447.24] creates all kinds of different stuff
[1444.88 - 1450.40] conjunctivitis sty I know I said that
[1447.24 - 1453.84] sty it creates all these things right
[1450.40 - 1456.88] strep is behind so it's getting to the
[1453.84 - 1459.84] underlying part of why you have the
[1456.88 - 1462.56] sinusitis it's getting to the underlying
[1459.84 - 1465.20] aspect and that's the key right there
[1462.56 - 1467.24] and then what happens is the strep sits
[1465.20 - 1469.36] inside the sinuses has a field day
[1467.24 - 1471.04] because the immune systems low and when
[1469.36 - 1473.52] your immune system is low the strep is
[1471.04 - 1475.92] doing a dance inside the person's sinus
[1473.52 - 1477.56] cavities and lymphatic system what I've
[1475.92 - 1479.08] seen over the years is a lot of people
[1477.56 - 1481.64] and not everybody not everybody but a
[1479.08 - 1484.72] lot of people will have the acne along
[1481.64 - 1488.92] with some sinusitis along with
[1484.72 - 1490.64] mucus mucus forming spittle you know
[1488.92 - 1492.96] just a mucus

[1492.96 - 1497.72] they'll have some acne they'll get some
[1495.00 - 1501.08] ear stuff they'll get some eye stuff
[1497.72 - 1504.84] they'll get all kinds of dry eyes their
[1501.08 - 1507.80] eyes are so dry because their ducks are
[1504.84 - 1510.68] clogged with strap and they don't know
[1507.80 - 1512.84] it they got strep on their anus they got
[1510.68 - 1514.60] strep in their mouth they don't know it
[1512.84 - 1517.60] they got strep in their Ducks of their
[1514.60 - 1520.36] eyes they got SHP in their ears they get
[1517.60 - 1522.88] the sostis they their immune system's
[1520.36 - 1525.40] low it may be battling one or two or
[1522.88 - 1528.92] three different varieties of SHP and
[1525.40 - 1530.12] people don't realize this so you know so
[1528.92 - 1532.56] what do we do what do we do medical
[1530.12 - 1534.80] medium books what do we have in here
[1532.56 - 1539.36] we've got strep information in these
[1534.80 - 1542.00] books strep protocols in these books
[1539.36 - 1544.60] critical and in those protocols you'll
[1542.00 - 1546.88] see something like zinc like use the
[1544.60 - 1548.28] viery zinc just letting you know but you
[1546.88 - 1550.40] know there's like you see things like
[1548.28 - 1554.80] zinc in there and you see other things
[1550.40 - 1557.64] too you see other stuff golden seal but
[1554.80 - 1562.84] you see there's protocols right and then
[1557.64 - 1564.72] Foods to avoid foods to avoid now listen
[1562.84 - 1567.60] out of all this all the different
[1564.72 - 1570.64] so-called modalities out there medical
[1567.60 - 1573.48] medium information is probably one of
[1570.64 - 1577.36] the more lenient when it comes down to
[1573.48 - 1580.60] food okay probably one of the more
[1577.36 - 1582.72] lenient but people heal because it's not
[1580.60 - 1583.96] about taking away everybody's food quite
[1582.72 - 1586.36] the contrary with medical Med
[1583.96 - 1589.56] information there's people that quote
[1586.36 - 1591.52] can only eat four blueberries before
[1589.56 - 1593.88] they found medical medium
[1591.52 - 1595.72] information they can only eat four
[1593.88 - 1597.36] blueberries a day before they found
[1595.72 - 1599.84] medical medium information they realize
[1597.36 - 1601.92] they can eat way more blueberries and do
[1599.84 - 1603.56] their healing and heal there's people
[1601.92 - 1605.52] out there that couldn't touch a piece of
[1603.56 - 1607.44] fruit were told stay away from banana
[1605.52 - 1610.84] stay away from anything stay away from
[1607.44 - 1613.04] oranges stay away from leafy greens
[1610.84 - 1616.20] people being told that vegetables are
[1613.04 - 1617.72] toxic and I still see that out there
[1616.20 - 1619.76] there's ads running out there all the
[1617.72 - 1622.16] time like your vegetables are toxic
[1619.76 - 1623.80] don't eat any vegetables that's the
[1622.16 - 1625.76] problem right there so how do people
[1623.80 - 1628.40] heal but staying away from certain foods
[1625.76 - 1629.72] can help with the sinusitis it can help
[1628.40 - 1631.76] with the strap and that's really
[1629.72 - 1635.16] important right there Sapphire Rose on
[1631.76 - 1638.20] YouTube can toxic heavy metals block you
[1635.16 - 1641.36] spiritually and only allow you to
[1638.20 - 1644.56] progress to a certain level of
[1641.36 - 1647.52] Consciousness and manifestations okay so
[1644.56 - 1650.04] okay toxic heavy metals can definitely
[1647.52 - 1652.36] rain on somebody's parade on a lot of
[1650.04 - 1656.48] levels it doesn't mean you never
[1652.36 - 1659.12] spiritually grow but toxic heavy metals
[1656.48 - 1660.60] can talk for you they can speak for you
[1659.12 - 1661.88] that's why we're sitting here making
[1660.60 - 1665.00] little detox
[1661.88 - 1666.80] movie because I never want I would like
[1665.00 - 1669.64] I would like this right now because I
[1666.80 - 1671.92] never want metals to speak for me ever I
[1669.64 - 1674.28] don't because if they were speaking for
[1671.92 - 1678.88] me they'd probably be doing this yeah
[1674.28 - 1680.60] fish oil is great okay you know 20 15
[1678.88 - 1683.88] fish oil is amazing take lots of fish
[1680.60 - 1686.84] oil 2016 ooh do a liver flush with tons
[1683.88 - 1690.08] of olive oil 2017 make sure you do lots
[1686.84 - 1692.24] of ionized alkaline water 2018 make sure
[1690.08 - 1695.88] you cold plunge cold plunge that's the
[1692.24 - 1698.52] answer 2019 make sure you do you do like
[1695.88 - 1701.20] grounding Barefoot always be barefoot
[1698.52 - 1703.04] 2020 meanwhile you stay sick you stay
[1701.20 - 1706.00] sick you stay sick I don't let metal
[1703.04 - 1707.72] speak for me if they spoke for me people
[1706.00 - 1709.96] would not be getting better out there I
[1707.72 - 1711.96] can promise promise you that because I'd
[1709.96 - 1715.16] probably hear so
[1711.96 - 1719.28] wrong and I'd probably be listening to S
[1715.16 - 1721.32] so and be like what did you say um what
[1719.28 - 1722.60] um swimming's healthy for you is that
[1721.32 - 1724.08] what you said or did you just say cold
[1722.60 - 1727.04] plunging is healthy for you freeze your
[1724.08 - 1728.56] butt off the point is is that yeah I
[1727.04 - 1730.44] don't want Metals ever speaking for me
[1728.56 - 1732.52] down the road as I get older and older
[1730.44 - 1734.08] and older I don't want Metals talking
[1732.52 - 1736.36] for me and that's what happens so with a
[1734.08 - 1738.80] lot of people metals are talking for
[1736.36 - 1741.36] them keep that in mind
[1738.80 - 1743.84] they are and they get and what happens
[1741.36 - 1746.56] is metals are speaking for them they can
[1743.84 - 1749.20] contradict themselves Seven Ways to
[1746.56 - 1751.40] Sunday they can make people miserable
[1749.20 - 1753.84] emotionally they can make people say
[1751.40 - 1757.32] things they never wanted to
[1753.84 - 1760.92] say metals can create tourettes
[1757.32 - 1764.32] OCD yeah metals can create depression
[1760.92 - 1767.16] anxiety uh-huh medals can create
[1764.32 - 1769.40] depersonalization metals can make memory

[1982.68 - 1988.08] hi right now so he said I am on heavy
[1985.24 - 1990.48] metal detox smoothie since seven years
[1988.08 - 1993.36] thanks to you and I have begun studying
[1990.48 - 1996.96] again at 61 years
[1993.36 - 2002.44] old yeah the heavy metal
[1996.96 - 2006.92] detox it clears someone it clears
[2002.44 - 2008.68] them it's like a clearing over time is
[2006.92 - 2011.88] what it is
[2008.68 - 2013.92] and yes toxic heavy metals speak for
[2011.88 - 2016.00] people they make people break up in
[2013.92 - 2017.36] relationships they make people say
[2016.00 - 2019.68] things they shouldn't have said in a
[2017.36 - 2022.00] relationship and regret it later they
[2019.68 - 2024.60] make people like get really really
[2022.00 - 2026.24] emotional and triggered so easy because
[2024.60 - 2027.64] they got Metals getting in the way of
[2026.24 - 2029.72] their neurons so they're receiving
[2027.64 - 2031.60] messages messages are leaving them in
[2029.72 - 2034.48] ways that aren't as healthy as it could
[2031.60 - 2037.36] be the heavy the heavy metals can
[2034.48 - 2039.36] saturate into people's brains and
[2037.36 - 2042.84] confuse use neurons and neurotransmitter
[2039.36 - 2045.96] chemicals and and um and all of it
[2042.84 - 2048.56] electrical impulses allowing somebody to
[2045.96 - 2051.04] shift gears in a way that may not be
[2048.56 - 2053.52] fruitful and helpful and then the metals
[2051.04 - 2056.48] speak for people and it's really
[2053.52 - 2058.52] difficult and that's okay that's okay
[2056.48 - 2061.16] because we work on cleaning them up and
[2058.52 - 2063.84] getting them out and getting them to go
[2061.16 - 2066.32] away that's important right there so
[2063.84 - 2068.04] keep that in mind anyway making a little
[2066.32 - 2071.24] bit of a smoothie right here heav metal

[2191.40 - 2196.40] is what we're going to do so look look
[2193.84 - 2198.60] if you want to do more than two cups be

[2198.60 - 2206.00] cups be my guest okay it's okay I've
[2201.92 - 2208.84] always said the heavy metal detox isn't
[2206.00 - 2212.80] just smoothie it could be a smoothie
[2208.84 - 2214.12] Bowl it can be a meal throughout the day
[2212.80 - 2217.12] as long as you have the five key
[2214.12 - 2218.04] ingredients to do the job that needs to
[2217.12 - 2221.24] be done
[2218.04 - 2222.72] the five key ingredients the spirulina
[2221.24 - 2224.96] you got to have that the barley grass
[2222.72 - 2226.88] juice powder you got to have that the
[2224.96 - 2229.36] right the wild blueberries you got to
[2226.88 - 2231.72] have that and the dols that's the liquid
[2229.36 - 2234.64] dols right there um all right let me
[2231.72 - 2237.44] just get some blueberries in here ooh
[2234.64 - 2239.24] don't call them blueberries do not call
[2237.44 - 2241.88] them blueberries these are wild
[2239.24 - 2245.00] blueberries huge difference I just
[2241.88 - 2247.64] insulted these wild blueberries by
[2245.00 - 2249.48] calling them a blueberry
[2247.64 - 2252.12] because there's a vast difference from
[2249.48 - 2253.68] cultivated clamshell meaning like you
[2252.12 - 2256.12] get the little pint-sized clam shell the
[2253.68 - 2258.00] plastic clam shells at the store and
[2256.12 - 2259.92] it's a cultivated blueberry it's not a
[2258.00 - 2264.16] wild blueberry people use them all the
[2259.92 - 2266.08] time they don't do a scratch compared to
[2264.16 - 2268.80] the wild blueberry very important when
[2266.08 - 2270.96] it comes down to doing the job Kelly
[2268.80 - 2273.40] over there on YouTube that makes me tear
[2270.96 - 2275.52] up your info has saved my life after
[2273.40 - 2278.20] cancer thank you for being here Kelly
[2275.52 - 2281.16] amazing and thank you for um just being
[2278.20 - 2285.04] in the community oh my God over there on
[2281.16 - 2287.96] YouTube Om I have so many doctors in my
[2285.04 - 2291.04] family and they all have friends Etc but
[2287.96 - 2294.12] none could help your truth Shines My
[2291.04 - 2296.84] question is how effective is the vimergy
[2294.12 - 2299.92] wbb powder wild blueberry powder versus
[2296.84 - 2304.08] the frozen fruit love from Ireland so
[2299.92 - 2306.08] here's what I do okay now all right so
[2304.08 - 2307.56] keep this in mind right you got the
[2306.08 - 2310.56] blueberries you got the wild blueberries
[2307.56 - 2312.68] like the Wyman's company that I endorse
[2310.56 - 2316.20] they're the ones that I use right for
[2312.68 - 2319.12] the Frozen wild blueberry okay all right
[2316.20 - 2322.00] and this is another wild blueberry that
[2319.12 - 2324.40] comes from a different area on the
[2322.00 - 2326.20] planet okay very important to know here
[2324.40 - 2330.04] right I like
[2326.20 - 2332.64] using like different wild blueberri so I
[2330.04 - 2334.40] got this one here from viy which I'm
[2332.64 - 2336.24] excited about and I showed you the no
[2334.40 - 2338.04] anti-caking agents right how incredible
[2336.24 - 2340.16] that is
[2338.04 - 2341.80] and I like the Wyman's too and I'm going
[2340.16 - 2344.76] to put a little bit of the Wyman's while
[2341.80 - 2348.52] blueberry juice in there too
[2344.76 - 2352.40] because every strain of wild
[2348.52 - 2355.12] blueberry right is a little different
[2352.40 - 2357.60] still holds power but it's a little
[2355.12 - 2361.48] different that's how incredible it is
[2357.60 - 2363.92] right the low Bush so this is the low
[2361.48 - 2366.08] Bush wild blueberry it's really
[2363.92 - 2368.80] incredible that we even have access to
[2366.08 - 2371.08] this and I dream about that when I was
[2368.80 - 2373.16] young I remember I was laying in a wild
[2371.08 - 2374.92] Blueberry field low Bush wild Blueberry
[2373.16 - 2377.24] field and I was doing that thing where
[2374.92 - 2379.80] you ever you know where you go into the
[2377.24 - 2381.80] snow and you do the angel thing in the
[2379.80 - 2384.40] snow where you wave your arms and your
[2381.80 - 2385.96] legs go out like this and your Fanning
[2384.40 - 2387.64] right in the snow and you're laying on
[2385.96 - 2388.92] your back and you're just doing right
[2387.64 - 2391.92] you're just doing this while you're
[2388.92 - 2393.52] laying on your back right you know and
[2391.92 - 2395.64] you try to make your wings as big as you
[2393.52 - 2397.84] want whatever and you're doing that
[2395.64 - 2399.96] there okay well I
[2397.84 - 2402.68] as a child would love laying in a wild
[2399.96 - 2404.64] Blueberry field and S so would tell me
[2402.68 - 2406.24] the power of the wild blueberry how
[2404.64 - 2408.84] incredible it was and what it does for
[2406.24 - 2411.72] the body and the antioxidant power it
[2408.84 - 2413.52] has for the brain and nervous system and
[2411.72 - 2415.08] for the everything for the immune system
[2413.52 - 2416.96] right and then I would lay in the wild
[2415.08 - 2419.24] blueberry fields and I would do the
[2416.96 - 2421.04] whole Angel Fanning thing where I'd kind
[2419.24 - 2422.60] of have my legs spreading and my arms
[2421.04 - 2424.00] spreading and I would do like like that
[2422.60 - 2426.20] in the field and then when I would get
[2424.00 - 2429.24] up there'd be like an imprint of an
[2426.20 - 2431.04] angel in the wild Blueberry Patch right
[2429.24 - 2433.64] just like if you were doing that in the
[2431.04 - 2436.88] snow it's just incredible God I just
[2433.64 - 2438.68] love thinking about that all right so
[2436.88 - 2440.44] let's get some cilantro in here if you
[2438.68 - 2442.60] guys are okay with that so I'm going to
[2440.44 - 2445.04] pop a cup in here maybe a little bit
[2442.60 - 2448.32] more surprise surprise a little bit
[2445.04 - 2453.08] more but do you realize what I just did
[2448.32 - 2455.36] you guys know this right right um are
[2453.08 - 2458.28] you making dinner tonight would you like
[2455.36 - 2459.92] some cilantro on your f
[2458.28 - 2461.76] would you like some cilantro on your
[2459.92 - 2463.56] chicken if you're a chicken eater right
[2461.76 - 2466.00] would you like some cilantro on your
[2463.56 - 2467.84] avocado if you're an avocado eater right
[2466.00 - 2470.72] I'm having some cilantro for dinner
[2467.84 - 2472.32] tonight I eat cilantro I can have just a
[2470.72 - 2475.04] little bit of that right on my avocado
[2472.32 - 2477.76] little bit of that on my right my fish I
[2475.04 - 2480.60] could just do that okay but that's
[2477.76 - 2483.76] nothing compared to when you eat
[2480.60 - 2484.92] cilantro and you use it and the hmds is
[2483.76 - 2486.92] incredible because of the amount of
[2484.92 - 2490.04] cilantro that goes in there you're using
[2486.92 - 2492.92] this herb as a leafy green and man when
[2490.04 - 2495.56] you supersede greens by using a leafy
[2492.92 - 2499.24] green herb to this capacity that's
[2495.56 - 2503.72] another thing all on its own never mind
[2499.24 - 2506.72] the metal enhancement stuff that that
[2503.72 - 2509.32] cilantro does with removing Metals
[2506.72 - 2511.04] incredible so here we go all right so
[2509.32 - 2513.64] let's move on a little bit I'm going to
[2511.04 - 2516.92] add just a little bit more I'm going to
[2513.64 - 2520.00] do the wild blueberry powder I love this
[2516.92 - 2521.76] I love love seeing clumps love seeing
[2520.00 - 2525.72] big clumps in
[2521.76 - 2529.40] here if I don't see big clumps in here I
[2525.72 - 2533.44] will not be happy I want big fat clumps
[2529.40 - 2535.64] in this there's a reason for that okay
[2533.44 - 2536.52] no anti-caking agents you guys have to
[2535.64 - 2538.12] understand there people out there
[2536.52 - 2539.56] they're chemical sensitive and they're
[2538.12 - 2541.60] everything sensitive and they could be
[2539.56 - 2543.84] doing caking they could doing
[2541.60 - 2545.32] anti-caking agents and they don't even
[2543.84 - 2547.84] know it they're in every patter out
[2545.32 - 2550.56] there no company does this
[2547.84 - 2552.64] this is different entirely different
[2550.56 - 2554.68] companies may say that they they don't
[2552.64 - 2557.28] do it they don't do it because it takes
[2554.68 - 2559.40] too much energy too much time too much
[2557.28 - 2562.32] money no one would do it anyway it's the
[2559.40 - 2564.40] five main ingredients that makes the
[2562.32 - 2566.40] difference that's what it is now if you
[2564.40 - 2570.08] got three out of five you got three out
[2566.40 - 2573.32] of five and I'll talk about that okay we
[2570.08 - 2575.36] got Boom the wild blueberry we knocked
[2573.32 - 2578.08] that out of the park wild blueberry
[2575.36 - 2581.44] juice frozen wild blueberry from londs

[2597.56 - 2601.36] a droper full if I can't get the heavy
[2599.44 - 2603.20] metal detox smoothie in but I want to
[2601.36 - 2605.40] get at least three of the five
[2603.20 - 2607.48] ingredients to the heavy metal detox in
[2605.40 - 2609.72] my body so I can make a difference right
[2607.48 - 2612.72] with Metals if I want to do that I will
[2609.72 - 2614.76] do a straight dropper full of the ads
[2612.72 - 2616.56] right in my mouth just like that okay
[2614.76 - 2618.28] I'm going to pop that in
[2616.56 - 2621.92] there
[2618.28 - 2624.00] boom remember you don't have to have the
[2621.92 - 2626.68] Smoothie you can have it in a smoothie
[2624.00 - 2629.64] Bowl you can have it on a salad but get
[2626.68 - 2632.24] your five key ingredients in through the

[2817.68 - 2822.40] not everything is physical not
[2819.84 - 2824.24] everything is physical but I've seen
[2822.40 - 2826.12] people have those experiences where they
[2824.24 - 2828.40] feel that way and once they rid metals
[2826.12 - 2832.52] and other poisons and toxins they're
[2828.40 - 2835.92] feeling different feeling different you
[2832.52 - 2839.24] know and also I mean if someone had a

[2847.24 - 2853.32] We're Young Adult and they suffered this
[2850.08 - 2855.68] okay it can hang on it can be wired into
[2853.32 - 2857.48] those neurons and it it needs some
[2855.68 - 2861.20] healing and when it's wired into those
[2857.48 - 2863.36] neurons we have allergies like allergies
[2861.20 - 2865.60] to different people and different
[2863.36 - 2867.56] experiences and different words and all
[2865.60 - 2870.20] kinds of
[2867.56 - 2872.12] stuff somebody can have emotional
[2870.20 - 2875.00] injuries to the brain that caused a
[2872.12 - 2877.36] little bit of scar tissue in the brain
[2875.00 - 2879.88] creating something like the feeling of

[3002.76 - 3006.72] God and doesn't believe in anything like
[3005.00 - 3009.56] that doesn't believe there's this one

[3081.28 - 3086.76] quick I'm going to like bullet point
[3083.68 - 3088.52] this right now for you
[3086.76 - 3090.92] medical medium
[3088.52 - 3094.52] information on heavy
[3090.92 - 3096.56] metals and the heavy metal
[3094.52 - 3100.48] detox was the
[3096.56 - 3102.96] Forefront still is but when it hit it
[3100.48 - 3104.24] was groundbreaking nobody even knew
[3102.96 - 3105.56] about any of the stuff like this or
[3104.24 - 3109.00] Metals what they do or anything like
[3105.56 - 3111.00] that but what happened was my
[3109.00 - 3113.92] competitors my
[3111.00 - 3117.48] competitors very important to
[3113.92 - 3119.24] know were like how did this guy do this
[3117.48 - 3121.20] how does he have millions of people all
[3119.24 - 3123.00] around the world how were millions of
[3121.20 - 3125.16] books sold on the planet all around the
[3123.00 - 3128.64] world teaching people about detoxing
[3125.16 - 3130.96] medals and I want a piece of that my
[3128.64 - 3133.68] competitors decided to start attacking
[3130.96 - 3135.88] medical medium information by saying out
[3133.68 - 3138.04] there you need binders you need binders
[3135.88 - 3140.08] oh you're they were so sick of hearing
[3138.04 - 3142.96] everybody doing the medical medium heavy
[3140.08 - 3147.44] metal detox that they came up with this
[3142.96 - 3149.84] other alternative opposition weapon
[3147.44 - 3153.08] a verbal
[3149.84 - 3155.64] weapon they were so sick of hearing it
[3153.08 - 3158.24] everywhere from nutritionists to health
[3155.64 - 3159.80] coaches to regular influencers they
[3158.24 - 3161.68] hated hearing I'm on the heavy metal
[3159.80 - 3163.84] detox I'm on the medical medium heavy
[3161.68 - 3165.36] metal detox I'm on the heavy metal heavy
[3163.84 - 3166.64] metal heavy metal heavy metal medical
[3165.36 - 3168.28] medium medical medium medical medium
[3166.64 - 3171.08] medical and they just totally just
[3168.28 - 3173.48] popped and they said yeah but you know
[3171.08 - 3175.56] what he doesn't have any binders in
[3173.48 - 3177.76] there what there's no binders in medical
[3175.56 - 3179.72] medium there's there's no bonders in his
[3177.76 - 3181.56] in in his smoothie or in his heavy metal
[3179.72 - 3185.56] detox program thingy even though there's
[3181.56 - 3187.40] no program but protocol it is a protocol
[3185.56 - 3189.88] and what happened was yeah the
[3187.40 - 3192.48] competitors were like yeah we're getting
[3189.88 - 3194.40] a rise out of people we're scaring them
[3192.48 - 3197.04] we're telling him there's no binders in
[3194.40 - 3198.44] his stuff you need a binder his heavy
[3197.04 - 3200.32] metal detox doesn't work because you
[3198.44 - 3202.16] need a binder you need the proper binder
[3200.32 - 3204.16] so what happened was about four years
[3202.16 - 3207.44] ago maybe 5 years ago somewhere around
[3204.16 - 3211.40] that time period the opposite
[3207.44 - 3214.76] the jealous jealous greedy
[3211.40 - 3218.24] greedy people competitors were like
[3214.76 - 3219.68] binder binder binder people wanted to
[3218.24 - 3221.28] make money some people in the medical
[3219.68 - 3223.72] medium Community were like you know
[3221.28 - 3226.36] Screw Anthony let me go and push a
[3223.72 - 3228.44] binder let me go and push Zite or some
[3226.36 - 3229.92] other thing and call it a binder Anthony
[3228.44 - 3231.80] doesn't know anything he doesn't know
[3229.92 - 3233.52] how to do anything even meanwhile people
[3231.80 - 3236.80] are healing around the world including
[3233.52 - 3239.68] them it wasn't it was a way for people
[3236.80 - 3242.32] to bank over the last so many years to
[3239.68 - 3244.44] try to sell a binder here you're not on
[3242.32 - 3246.12] charcoal charcoal will help do it you're
[3244.44 - 3248.12] not on this this will help do it you're
[3246.12 - 3250.16] not on Zite that will help do it right
[3248.12 - 3252.20] it was all about like you you need to be
[3250.16 - 3254.28] in a binder you're on heavy metal detox
[3252.20 - 3257.08] you don't have a binder what what what
[3254.28 - 3260.52] and they spread this
[3257.08 - 3262.92] cancellation tactic technique all
[3260.52 - 3264.36] around and then people were also selling
[3262.92 - 3265.96] binders all kinds of what they called
[3264.36 - 3267.16] were binders like you need to be on this
[3265.96 - 3268.92] binder and were selling it and then
[3267.16 - 3270.40] they'll do this oh yeah you're taking
[3268.92 - 3272.60] the medical meme heavy metal detox
[3270.40 - 3275.32] smoothie you should also add this in
[3272.60 - 3277.52] there this will help you add shilene in
[3275.32 - 3280.12] there add xelate in there add folic
[3277.52 - 3282.84] minerals and fulid acid fulvic acid in
[3280.12 - 3284.68] there do that and just so they can sell
[3282.84 - 3287.16] stuff and sell stuff because they were
[3284.68 - 3288.68] training people the medical medium heavy
[3287.16 - 3290.52] metal detox smoothie or heavy metal
[3288.68 - 3293.64] detox doesn't have a
[3290.52 - 3296.04] binder okay and that's where the binder
[3293.64 - 3297.60] thing came out that's where it all kind
[3296.04 - 3301.56] of like developed just in the health
[3297.60 - 3305.84] scene right now but guess what guess
[3301.56 - 3308.20] what it is all binder baby it is all
[3305.84 - 3310.20] binder that's how stupid the whole thing
[3308.20 - 3312.04] was but they made some Headway a little
[3310.20 - 3313.64] bit because they convinced enough people
[3312.04 - 3315.52] that they were doing something wrong
[3313.64 - 3317.28] because they needed a binder yeah they
[3315.52 - 3319.12] hurt those people because they use
[3317.28 - 3320.92] zeolites that actually weren't edible
[3319.12 - 3322.12] varieties of zeolite they were doing
[3320.92 - 3323.40] that they were doing charcoal and
[3322.12 - 3325.00] damaging their Linings of their
[3323.40 - 3326.32] intestinal tract they were doing all
[3325.00 - 3327.44] kinds of things and they're con
[3326.32 - 3328.96] convincing people they needed these
[3327.44 - 3331.60] binders when they didn't because guess
[3328.96 - 3335.00] what the binder is built into the heavy
[3331.60 - 3336.64] metal detox that's right the binder is
[3335.00 - 3340.08] built in
[3336.64 - 3342.92] here the ultimate binders are in here
[3340.08 - 3345.92] that is the whole point it's there to
[3342.92 - 3348.52] grab on to junk and garbage and metals
[3345.92 - 3351.44] and stuff and poisons and pesticides and
[3348.52 - 3353.64] anything else it's there to bind onto it
[3351.44 - 3355.36] and take it out and if you read the
[3353.64 - 3356.84] medical medium books you'll see the
[3355.36 - 3360.12] process in how it
[3356.84 - 3362.56] works and it has Street Credibility man
[3360.12 - 3365.00] it has street cred of saving people's
[3362.56 - 3366.56] lives of removing crap out of them so
[3365.00 - 3368.44] they could think clear and get their
[3366.56 - 3370.84] life back and rid their depression and
[3368.44 - 3373.12] everything else it is a
[3370.84 - 3375.92] binder it is a
[3373.12 - 3378.68] binder but my
[3375.92 - 3380.88] competitors wanted to bank and they
[3378.68 - 3383.16] wanted to try to take me down so they
[3380.88 - 3385.20] pulled the binder game and they
[3383.16 - 3387.40] convinced a few people to be concerned
[3385.20 - 3390.56] about binders but those people were
[3387.40 - 3392.88] screwed over by them and that's what
[3390.56 - 3394.80] happened just line you're actually going
[3392.88 - 3398.76] to be there no way YouTube looking
[3394.80 - 3401.24] forward to seeing you in Calabasas

[3424.84 - 3428.48] of

[3428.48 - 3433.44] people do that and try to set me up and
[3430.32 - 3435.20] try to frame me on no binder crap and
[3433.44 - 3436.80] try to like do everything that could to
[3435.20 - 3438.80] take down the heavy metal detox that
[3436.80 - 3440.64] saved lives the the one that has the
[3438.80 - 3442.60] street cred when I heard people do that
[3440.64 - 3445.68] and say it doesn't have a binder it
[3442.60 - 3448.36] doesn't have a binder it's like Joker

[3467.92 - 3471.04] pulling out what it needs to pull out
[3469.32 - 3473.44] metals and so forth and everything else
[3471.04 - 3473.44] it is a
[3473.56 - 3477.92] binder and that makes you wake up in the

[3871.80 - 3875.36] meaning of life
[3873.84 - 3878.64] please
[3875.36 - 3881.80] well I think we all put our pants on the
[3878.64 - 3885.24] same way every single morning
[3881.80 - 3887.60] and that tells you
[3885.24 - 3891.16] something very
[3887.60 - 3891.16] important if you wear
[3891.40 - 3898.28] pants tells you a lot it's an old saying
[3895.88 - 3900.36] that's been around for many many years
[3898.28 - 3902.40] that person puts their pants on the same
[3900.36 - 3906.12] way you do every single
[3902.40 - 3908.40] morning but it really tells you
[3906.12 - 3910.12] something really important so no matter
[3908.40 - 3913.68] who you are on this planet or what
[3910.12 - 3913.68] you're doing or anything else in
[3914.36 - 3919.84] that anything else no matter what you do
[3917.80 - 3921.46] looking up to somebody on this planet or
[3919.84 - 3923.44] looking down to somebody else on this
[3921.46 - 3925.40] [Music]
[3923.44 - 3928.92] planet when they get out of bed and
[3925.40 - 3930.32] maybe isn't right away you know they
[3928.92 - 3931.56] have to put their pants on pretty much
[3930.32 - 3934.08] the same way as everybody else puts
[3931.56 - 3937.08] their pants pants
[3934.08 - 3937.08] on
[3942.64 - 3948.88] and and the next part I'm not going to
[3944.76 - 3950.80] tell you because it's kind of sad but I
[3948.88 - 3954.36] think what I'll do is a telegram about
[3950.80 - 3956.08] it instead at some point cuz spirit's
[3954.36 - 3958.16] giving me a lot of information of why
[3956.08 - 3960.36] that's important to know it'll give you
[3958.16 - 3964.20] some meaning about
[3960.36 - 3969.08] life and it just hits you like
[3964.20 - 3969.08] this and you're just like
