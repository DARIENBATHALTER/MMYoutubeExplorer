about how it takes out the

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,640
the immune system and when it comes down

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,360
to lyme disease

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,720
they just take so much blood and so much

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,080
blood and then you go to another

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
specialist then you go to another

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,879
specialist they're taking more blood

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,080
then you lose your immune system and

81
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,760
nobody knows it

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440
and then the whole reason behind lyme

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
disease which they're unaware of unless

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,239
they know medical medium information

85
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,640

343
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,360
single day sometimes all day long right

344
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,680
it's good to take a fat break out of

345
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,000
your diet so you don't kill your liver

346
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,160
kill your gallbladder so you don't you

347
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,279
you don't kill your kidneys

348
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,800
the fats hurt the kidneys over time the

349
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
people end up getting kidney disease

350
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,199
later on because

351
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,800
the fats help to actually speed that up

352
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,720
help to promote that that condition and

353
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,480
all that plaque that fat plaque that

354
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,399
gets in the arteries of the heart

355
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,440
gets into the valves um that's from

356
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,759
a lifetime of eating fat so i like what

357
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,639
i like to do is i like to

358
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,759
make dishes that don't have the fats in

359
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,160
hopes that you guys

360
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,040
eat one dish a day or one smoothie a day

361
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
or

362
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,639
you know where you're not getting all

363
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,279
that fat in your in your in your meals

364
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
right

365
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,320
the whole reason why intermittent

366
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,759
fasting even though it's not a great

367
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,240
idea because it's not done right out

368
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,839
there

369
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,279
the whole reason it's even helping

370
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,279
people to some degree because they're

371
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,120
removing the fats in the morning

372
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,639
they're getting they're getting rid of

373
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,320
all that fat they're getting rid of the

374
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,240
peanut butter they're getting rid of the

375
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
eggs they're getting rid of the bacon

376
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,759
whatever it is they did in the morning

377
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,560
they're getting rid of

378
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,880
and that's why they start to get better

379
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,360
or

380
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,920
lose a little bit of weight because they

381
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,759

382
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,000
bombarding their liver they don't know

383
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,759

intermittent fasting so-called experts

385
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,160
don't know that's why

386
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,920
because the fat is missing and if they

387
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,440
do know now it's because of the medical

388
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,399

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,080
healthy fat and guess where healthy fat

482
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,039
ends up

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,880
in your arteries and your veins all fat

484
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,760
ends up in your arteries and your veins

485
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,360
down the road

486
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,799
you end up getting the stints you end up

487
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
getting the blood clots you end up

488
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,280
getting

489
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,919
the blood vessels you end up getting the

490
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,799
aneurysms you end up getting it all

491
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,240
the embolisms aneurysms blood clots you

492
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,960
got to get the stint you got to get the

493
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
shunts

494
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,440
all that stuff and and the thing is the

495
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,559
problem is with fat

496
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,159
is fat's so addictive it's addictive

497
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,000
because it triggers the adrenaline

498
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,520
right you eat that avocado and i don't

499
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,120
mind if you guys eat avocado i don't

500
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,679
mind if you guys eat some healthy fats

501
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,360
and

502
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,600
if you guys like animal protein and you

503
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,000
want like you know salmon or anything

504
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,480
but

505
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,360
what it is is there's so much of it and

506
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,679
there's so

507
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,039
too much of it in the diet and then all

508
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,039
the health gurus are like

509
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,400
you know more fat fats good for you you

510
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,320
need fat for your brain

511
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,760
and they don't realize it but the more

512
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,080
fat you eat

513
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,679
your brain atrophies down the road so

514
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,520
you end up getting your brain start to

515
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,360
shrink and shrink and shrink

516
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,720
this is cooking actually really good and

517
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,440
really quick

518
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,840
um so this is going really good right

519
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,840
now

520
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,640
it's still it's it's it's going nice and

521
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,799
good i'm gonna pop a lid on here for for

522
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,960
a second

523
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,080
so um the whole point is that fat builds

524
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,080
up with plaque

525
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,840
sits on the inside of the heart sits on

526
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,240
the inside of the arteries

527
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,919
sits on the inside of blood vessels so

528
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,159
as we're doing the fats and we don't

529
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,640
stop and it's every single day

530
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,799
and it's not just that if you did all

531
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,679
that bacon in the past

532
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,679
it's it's it built up a fine layer

533
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,120
inside the arteries and veins

534
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,360
you can't get that out unless you go low

535
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,120
fat unless you drop the radical fats

536
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,000
once in a while unless you start to have

537
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,799
a meal

538
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,720
that's fat free once in a while doreen

539
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,200
says i feel so much better fat free for

540
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,000

542
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,919
that incredible

543
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,559
so amy said can't wait for the book yeah

544
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,159
that's amazing like 40 pounds

545
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,000
and what people don't realize is they

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,600
all have a layer of fat inside their

547
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,760
veins and arteries

548
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,799
they all do it's from the bacon the eggs

549
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,480
the milk cheese

550
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,000
the butter in your coffee whatever it is

551
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480

my little heart in here

603
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,279
on here and um here's what happens when

604
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,720
you keep on eating all that fat

605
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,720
i'm not saying you guys like i said

606
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,520
can't have some tahini and can't have

607
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720

608
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,200
uh hemp seeds all right sesame seeds

609
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,520
right

610
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,320
okay can't have some sunflower seeds

611
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,320
can't do some pumpkin seeds you know

612
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,200
um i'm not saying that you can't have

613
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,679
all that

614
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,400
or have your favorite animal protein

615
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,559
right

616
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,600
but what i'm saying is that's why

617
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,799
everybody's brains

618
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,520
atrophy everybody's brain's atrophy

619
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,080
because the fat stops the brain from

620
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,600
getting

621
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,679
fed glycogen glucose

622
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,799
the fats stop the glucose from getting

623
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,360
into the brain

624
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,120
the brain atrophies year after year now

625
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,720
you're 40 years old brain shrinks a

626
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
little bit now you're 50 years old

627
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,400
the brain shrinks a little bit brain

628
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,559
brain brain shrinks ring shrinks that's

629
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,080
what happens

630
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,000
and then the heart at the same time

631
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,679
fills up with all that lining all that

632
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,120
fat all your blood vessels your veins

633
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,960
your arteries and guess what everybody

634
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,880

635
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,200

636
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,760
fats make sure you're on all those fats

637
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,360
they don't pay the price meaning they

638
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,679
don't care about you

639
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,720
20 years from now after they gave you

640
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,080

chapter right here i want to read a

707
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,600
quote

708
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,600
for you in the moment

709
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,840
so much information to cover

710
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,120
it really is there's just so much good

711
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,440
information to cover so

712
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,640
thanks to the readers who went into

713
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,679
action

714
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,320
with the information here this book has

715
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,200
prompted

716
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,360
medical research and science to

717
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,640
re-categorize

718
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:54,240
lyme disease while labeling lyme

719
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,880
as autoimmune still does not represent a

720
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,919
full understanding of lyme symptoms

721
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,760
this re-categorization is a way

722
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,360
for medical research and science to

723
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,600
admit we don't

724
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,880
understand this as well as we thought we

725
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,799
did

726
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,320
and that's a major shift towards

727
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,120
progress

728
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,679
it's testament to the people who read

729
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,000
here in medical medium that lyme disease

730
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,360
is

731
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,360
viral not bacterial who brought that

732
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,520
information to their doctors and who

733
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,880
applied the healing protocols here and

734
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,880
got results

735
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,440
it's also thanks to the doctors who have

736
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,240
educated themselves with this material

737
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,200
as they work to help patients many

738
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
doctors

739
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,720
have even applied the healing protocols

740
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,080
in their own lives

741
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,840
so i'm talking about lyme disease and

742
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,200
if you're someone who doesn't have lyme

743
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,559
disease you weren't diagnosed with lyme

744
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,840
disease you might want to hang around

745
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,480
for this

746
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,080
um because it applies to so many

747
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,960
different conditions okay

748
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,360
that's fatigue that's fibromyalgia

749
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,480
that's

750
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,240
ms because in the end they all can get a

751
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,360
lyme diagnosis tomorrow if you go to a

752
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,240
lyme doctor

753
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,840
if you got cfs if you got lupus just go

754
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,679
to a lyme doctor you'll get a lime that

755
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,279
you'll get a lyme disease diagnosis

756
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,360
and if you don't get one from that lyme

757
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,240
doctor go to another lyme doctor you'll

758
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,600
get one

759
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,399
you will get a lyme diagnosis if you go

760
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,080
lyme disease doctor shopping so it

761
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,399
applies to all you guys

762
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,679
that includes hashimoto's thyroid

763
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,640
problems that includes lupus that

764
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,240
includes ra

765
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,840
it includes just symptoms like tingles

766
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,559
and numbness aches and pains tightness

767
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,360
in the chest

768
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,799
even anxiety you go to a lyme doctor

769
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,919
you're gonna walk out of there with a

770
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,600
stamp on your back

771
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,200
boom that's gonna be the stamp on your

772
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,159
back saying lyme disease that's what

773
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,840
it's going to say

774
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:43,039
right when you walk out of there um

775
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,799
that's how it works this

776
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,600
this potato hash is cooking up really

777
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,600
nice right now

778
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,200
hey uh sigrid um the tick tock green

779
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,840
shirt video was so funny i laughed and

780
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,940
could not

781
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,300
sleep

782
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,300
[Laughter]

783
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,480
that tick-tock video with with the rat

784
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,960
running

785
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,039
up over the uh counter and the roaches

786
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,600
running over the counter

787
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,159
there's no editing on that that's one

788
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,519
straight

789
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:19,039
minute of me pulling that off it's

790
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:22,159
actually really funny

791
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,159
cooking this up right now

792
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,720
it's going to lyme disease

793
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,399
so if you've got a condition and you've

794
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,799
got symptoms whether it's ticks and

795
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,000
spasms whether it's leg cramps whether

796
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:41,279
it's restless leg syndrome whether it's

797
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,640
burning skin whether you've got

798
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,840
uh thrush whatever it is if you go to a

799
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
lyme doctor

800
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,399
lyme specialist you'll end up with that

801
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,919
lime stamp

802
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,600
that's just what's going to happen

803
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,480
you're not going to go to a lyme disease

804
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,679
doctor

805
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:02,480
and leave there without a lyme diagnosis

806
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,320
if you do go to another and you'll leave

807
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,880
there with the lyme diagnosis

808
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,440
because so really what happens is that

809
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,399
neurological lyme

810
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,240
is basically neurological everything

811
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,679
caused by epstein-barr virus

812
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,200
okay and shingles sometimes hhv-6

813
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,279
simplex 1 2 as well the cold sore virus

814
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,919
all right and sedimental virus can cause

815
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,840
some trouble too these are viruses

816
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,559
that release neurotoxin the epstein-barr

817
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,720
virus

818
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,519
releases a neurotoxin that neurotoxin

819
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,480
is what creates neurological symptoms

820
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,120
tingles and numbness aches and pains

821
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,000
burning skin pain in the jaw pain

822
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,799
everywhere

823
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,799
okay neck pain back pain migraines

824
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:57,360
neurotoxins just so you know

825
00:32:52,240 --> 00:33:01,679
and neurotoxins don't come from bacteria

826
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:05,600
they don't come from bacteria bacteria

827
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:09,559
bartonella the hybrid but vibesia

828
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:13,120
borrelia they don't release

829
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:14,720
neurotoxins you can't get neurological

830
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,200
symptoms from those

831
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,640
you can't but yet you have any

832
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,159
neurological symptoms

833
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,159
all you have to do is go to lyme doctor

834
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,159
they'll stamp you with a lyme diagnosis

835
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,919
out the door it's like the broom

836
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,600
salesman it's gonna

837
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,960
doesn't matter what size broom it is

838
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,320
you're just gonna get a broom as you're

839
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,120
leaving that store

840
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,519
right babisia bartonella borrelia are

841
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,799
not

842
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:40,159
super bugs they are not

843
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,279
super bugs news flash

844
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,640
they are not super bugs okay

845
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:52,080
they can get killed off really easily

846
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:54,480
with one dose of a mild antibiotic

847
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,279
they don't even cause neurological lyme

848
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,880
they don't cause neurological problems

849
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,760
they're harmless bacteria

850
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,960
and a harmless parasitical hybrid of

851
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,039
bacteria

852
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,960
as far as babisia goes it's really

853
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,240
bacteria

854
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,879
and um mrsa

855
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,560
mercy is a superbug so mersa is a

856
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,879
superbug i'm in lyme disease if you just

857
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,639
get

858
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,679
got on here it's a new edition medical

859
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,040
medium merce is a superbug right

860
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,320
a superbug it's one of the superbugs

861
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,599
antibiotic resistant and

862
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,599
they need less antibiotics and not even

863
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,679
the harshest antibiotics

864
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,960
and the success rate for mrsa is

865
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,520
unbelievable

866
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,240
it's incredible really a success rate

867
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,960
right

868
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,440
but for some reason you got neurological

869
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,280
lyme

870
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,200
so-called borrelia and bartonella and

871
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,839
babisia and you're sick for

872
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,079
years they can bombard you with the most

873
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,240
aggressive antibiotics

874
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,679
and you just get sicker and sicker and

875
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,480
sicker

876
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,119
and then would it what happens there

877
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,599
will you get the

878
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:05,119
neurotoxin shock you know and

879
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,960
people think it's herxheimer so you're

880
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,800
getting bombarded with heavy heavy

881
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,359
antibiotics

882
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,200
and and you're getting a reaction from

883
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,520
these heavy antibiotics you're not

884
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,200
getting a reaction from die off

885
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,359
and that's a confusion with lyme disease

886
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,800
right there so it's not that you

887
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,119
get die off

888
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,079
you know from the antibiotics you get

889
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,200
agitated

890
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,040
nerves from the antibiotics the nervous

891
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,119
system because it's so hypersensitive

892
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:37,119
from all those neurotoxins

893
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,880
can't handle all that harsh antibiotic

894
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,480
so now you're getting sicker you're

895
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,079
getting more neurological symptoms and

896
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,720
your lyme doctors like and this is what

897
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,320
happened for

898
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,480
years your lime doctor's like that's

899
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,480
herxheimer that's herxheimer keep up the

900
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,160
antibiotics that's herxheimer or we'll

901
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,440
back down the antibiotics so that you

902
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,640
can get a little bit better from your

903
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,160
herxheimer and then we'll bring the

904
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,440
antibiotics back in bringing the

905
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,440
antibiotics back in

906
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,320
it's misinformation it's actually the

907
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,320
wrong direction

908
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,480
so yeah i'm just cooking up this right

909
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,480
now

910
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,119
but of course if your doctor wants you

911
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,160
to do antibiotics you do antibiotics i

912
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,599
mean if that's

913
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,280
you know if you're happy with your

914
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,800
doctor you listen to your doctor you do

915
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,079
and i'm just talking about experience

916
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,880
from

917
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:27,839
from thousands and thousands of cases

918
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,839
over the years

919
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,839
now this book teaches how it's not

920
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,599
bacterial for lyme disease this book

921
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,680
teaches how it's viral

922
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,800
and that's what the real cause of lyme

923
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,800
disease is

924
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,079
so i'm giving you the rundown on the

925
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,760
bacterial aspect

926
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,359
so what happens is viruses such as

927
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,320
epstein-barr like i was talking about

928
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,960
before

929
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,320
cytomegalovirus simplex 1 and shingles

930
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,920
and hhv6

931
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,320
the viruses that i was speaking about

932
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,400
earlier those viruses create neurotoxins

933
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:02,880
neurotoxins inflame the nerves

934
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,240
when they inflame the nerves you get the

935
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,079
neurological symptoms

936

you you end up getting all those

942
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,079
different neurological symptoms from

943
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,599
neurotoxins

944
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,280
from viruses right so anyway you guys

945
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,320
this is cut this is coming along right

946
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,480
here

947
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,800
bacteria doesn't release neurotoxins as

948
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,960
i was saying before

949
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,200
bacteria can't release a neurotoxin it

950
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,839
doesn't produce a neurotoxin so bacteria

951
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,920
doesn't cause neurological symptoms

952
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,240
unless it's a bacterial infection that

953
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,000
causes a really extremely high fever and

954
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,800
then you can have temporary neurological

955
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,560
symptoms

956
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,240
but that's because of a really really

957
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,200
high fever but that's a whole different

958
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,720
story

959
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,040
talked about that over the years this is

960
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,880

hundreds of thousands of mostly women

1011
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,520
were injured from the mistakes made

1012
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,560
with lyme disease their bodies were

1013
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,599
bombarded with

1014
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,560
intense amounts of antibiotics some of

1015
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,720
the harshest antibiotics

1016
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,400
it led to them becoming sicker and

1017
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,480
sicker and sicker

1018
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,200
it led to doctor shopping forever

1019
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,160
and it it really really hurt a lot of

1020
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,760
people

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,520
tens of thousands lost their lives

1022
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,760
throughout the process

1023
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,200
um sandy was watering used to cook this

1024
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,480

of people look doctors weren't trying to

1035
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,880
hurt people it was just because

1036
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,319
you had to remember that with lyme

1037
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,760
disease doctors were never trying to

1038
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,240
hurt people that's not it at all

1039
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,160

1040
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,480
hearts in it they want to heal people

1041
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,240

made

1044
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,240
in the industries in the medical

1045
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,440
industry and misinformation has

1046
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,119
definitely sent people the wrong

1047
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,400
direction for healing it's made things

1048
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,560
very difficult over the years

1049
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,079
heavy metal detox smoothie saved my life

1050
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,480
christy amazing

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,400
look out look out for that zeolite stuff

1052
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,319
that's going around don't i i don't

1053
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,880
recommend that at all

1054
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,400
i'm noticing what happens when here's

1055
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,920
the thing the medical medium community

1056
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,040
has healed more people

1057
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,040
than anywhere else in all the

1058
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,480
communities and so

1059
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,880
all these old things these old trendy

1060
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,640
things

1061
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,640
try to come back into the medical meme

1062
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,480
community you know like the alkaline

1063
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,160
ionizer water machine it tries

1064
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,760
tries to come back in to sell it to

1065
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,800
people that have already healed

1066
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,040
and the same thing with zeolite i don't

1067
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,079
recommend zeolite at all so if someone

1068
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,520
thinks hey

1069
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:01,359
um you know you know i used to

1070
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:05,119
i used to i used to recommend

1071
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:07,680
a very gentle zeolite a long time ago

1072
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,640
i don't anymore though and it was only

1073
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,880
because

1074
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,720
there wasn't a lot of dolls to be found

1075
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,760
there wasn't a lot of atlantic dolls to

1076
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,599
be found

1077
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,520
and that was one of the reasons why i

1078
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,359
did and it was really

1079
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,280
and it was really just to help

1080
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,359
try to get a little bit of metal out of

1081
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,400
the intestinal tract okay

1082
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:30,000
and but it still wasn't enough zeolite

1083
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,960
just doesn't work good it just

1084
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,040
doesn't work and right now there's a

1085
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,480
whole bunch of mlm stuff going on a

1086
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,920
whole bunch of pyramid scheme stuff

1087
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,119
going on everybody's trying to sell

1088
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,599
something in the medical medium

1089
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,200
community and what happens is

1090
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,800
what happens is with the medical medium

1091
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,319
community is because it's the only

1092
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,200
community where that many people are

1093
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,359
healing

1094
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,880
and they're healing like like no one's

1095
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,040
ever seen

1096
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,640
it's easy to bring things in that never

1097
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,720
fixed anybody from the past

1098
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,760
and resell them in the medical medium

1099
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,200
community right

1100
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,960
that's how it's done in 2000 like that

1101
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,280
in the mid 2000s

1102
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,960
like the alkaline alkaline ionizer water

1103
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,160
machines they were practically dead on

1104
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,839
arrival because

1105
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,079
for the last 30 years they never got

1106
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,319
anybody better and

1107
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,079

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,240
comments a little while ago someone said

1122
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,920
that i'm not a people pleaser and i

1123
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,319
remembered that and read that

1124
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,040
and i was like that's true you know i'm

1125
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,440
not

1126
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,319
it's not about people pleasing it's

1127
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,359
about

1128
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,319
life saving right that's what it's about

1129
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,599
and it's about making sure that you have

1130
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,839
what you need

1131
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,280
so you don't get in trouble down the

1132
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,119
road with your condition

1133
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,160
so you have every opportunity to heal so

1134
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,920
the heavy metal detox smoothie

1135
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,680
is healing people and it has a track

1136
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,720
record of healing people right

1137
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,640
so then old you know old dogs come in

1138
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
with like things that never got anybody

1139
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,680
better

1140
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,440
like zeolite zeolite never got people

1141
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,760
better throughout the years it just

1142
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,040
it's been around for a long time and it

1143
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,000
never got anybody

1144
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,599
better it doesn't have that history of

1145
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,359
thousands and thousands of people

1146
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,560
getting better it just doesn't have that

1147
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,040
in fact it died

1148
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,760
along the way you couldn't even revive

1149
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,560
zeolite

1150
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,079
now people are trying to revive zeolite

1151
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,280
and say well you need your heavy metal

1152
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,000
detox smoothie

1153
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,119
with zeolite too you know and it's like

1154
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,800
no you don't

1155
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,400
um there's a reason why i don't

1156
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,280
recommend zeolite here's a couple of

1157
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,880
reasons too

1158
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,400
the ones on the market don't do what

1159
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,440
they're supposed to do i don't care

1160
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,920
what which one where how when

1161
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,560
i've looked at them all they don't do

1162
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,880
what they do

1163
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,560
so that's important to know the other

1164
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,400
thing is the zeolites

1165
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:07,440
they take your electrolytes away so

1166
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,480
and yeah be careful bad zeolites

1167
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,319
take your electrolytes away so

1168
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,720
it's not something you're just supposed

1169
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,920
to be pounding down or taken every day

1170
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,240
because

1171
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,040
it will drain your electrolytes that's

1172
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,760
one thing

1173
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,760
and also zeolites tend to they tend to

1174
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,280
dehydrate the body so your cells get

1175
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,400
dehydrated from zeolites so you get the

1176
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,359
zeolites that

1177
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,400
they dehydrate and they also take away

1178
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,319
electrolytes

1179
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,560
right it's what you don't want to do

1180
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,720
it's why i don't recommend it it's why

1181
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,280
i'm not recommending one now

1182
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,040
and you don't you don't need a zeolite

1183
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,200
to get out toxic heavy metals

1184
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,160
there's no zeolite that can leave your

1185
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,520
intestinal tract

1186
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,280
travel through your bloodstream and get

1187
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,520
to your brain

1188
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,520
just so you know there's no zeolite that

1189
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,319
can travel in your bloodstream and get

1190
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,520
to your brain

1191
00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:00,000
and remove metal these zeolites

1192
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,079
all of them they just died along the way

1193
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,240
no one cared anymore because they never

1194
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,640
fixed anybody they never did anything

1195
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,640
so what happens is you know the heavy

1196
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,079
metal detox smoothie blew up around the

1197
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,160
world right

1198
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,040
so it saved lives around the world

1199
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,480
because it gets metals out it's

1200
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,440
life-changing and when you have a

1201
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,240
community

1202
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,760
that has life-changing results that no

1203
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,720
one's ever seen before in all the other

1204
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,839
communities

1205
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,319
you you can sneak in something on the

1206
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,560

all you have to do is get all these

get them in there commenting 24 7. like

1222
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,960
hey

00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,720
try the zeolite hey try the zeolite hey

1224
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,800
try this college and try this collagen

1225
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,720
come combine that with medical medium

1226
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,119
you can take yourself all the way

1227
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,359
and that's the game being played and

1228
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,640
it's really a sad situation really

1229
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,319
because you take something that's

1230
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,560
working and healing somebody

1231
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,400
healing millions really around the world

1232
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,359
because millions of books

1233
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,920
have gotten around the world and and

1234
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:23,680
that's what that gold emblem right there

1235
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,760
um says and what happens is that then

1236
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,160
you can slip in these things so hey

1237
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,599
let's slip in some charcoal next things

1238
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,160
that don't really work

1239
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,800
let's slip in corella you know and get

1240
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,200
corella

1241
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,200
rebirthed again you know let's get let's

1242
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,359
get zeolite rebirthed again and we can

1243
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,359
do it with the medical medium community

1244
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,040
because medical medium community they're

1245
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,599
all you know they're they're all healing

1246
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,960
there

1247
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,720
and that's that's how it works

1248
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,079
um so i don't recommend zeolites just

1249
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,520
letting you know

1250
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,960
um and what happens is you can do

1251
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,440
something that's not helpful

1252
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,240
but the mm stuff is keeping you afloat

1253
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,520
right

1254
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,359
you're doing your celery juice you're

1255
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,800
doing a heavy metal detox smoothie right

1256
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,079
you're lowering your fats you're doing

1257
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,680
all kinds of you know you're doing your

1258
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,880
healing broth you're doing your spinach

1259
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,760
soups right

1260
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,520
you're working on healing but then

1261
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,559
you're doing zeolite

1262
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,599
and it's working against you right

1263
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,680
it's working against you you're doing

1264
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,640
nutritional yeast it's working against

1265
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,559
you

1266
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,720
you're doing um you know you're doing

1267
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,400
your cruella it's working against you

1268
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,319
you're doing your protein powders it's

1269
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,200
working against you

1270
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:31,520
see and and but eventually those

1271
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,640
unhealthy things those unhelpful things

1272
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,119
catch up to you

1273
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,960
and they start to tip the balance

1274
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,960
because you might be like

1275
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,559
do like look you might be doing less of

1276
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,400
your celery juice or less of some

1277
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,000
medical medium stuff and it's not now

1278
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,520
keeping you afloat and now you're doing

1279
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,480
the zeolite and the zeolite's

1280
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,559
dehydrating you

1281
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,480
it's dropping down your electrolytes

1282
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,920
okay and then you're doing other stuff

1283
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,880
and that's not helping eventually that

1284
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,480
stuff catches up

1285
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,920
and then you start going down for the

1286
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,960
count a few years later

1287
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,640
and then you think it's mm when it's

1288
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,800
really the zeolite

1289
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,800
i'm only one voice for medical medium

1290
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,400
right you see what these companies do

1291
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,040
they got like 30 people

1292
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,040
hacking away they're working for them

1293
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,960
and then when it's mlmlm they have

1294
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,319
another 50 people and then everybody's

1295
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,280
trying to sell it and everybody's trying

1296
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,599
to sell it

1297
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,359
that's hard to keep up with like they're

1298
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,119
all they got everybody working on it

1299
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,720
chipping away money's being made

1300
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,640
money's being made off the medical meme

1301
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,040

okay i mean honestly and it's hard to

1332
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,319
battle every single kind of trickery

1333
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,760
that's happening

1334
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:31,599
zeolite died it died it has a history of

1335
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,160
20 years of nobody getting better from

1336
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,760
it

1337
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,200
but when you have a community that's

1338
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,599
healing

1339
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,359
actually healing like the medical medium

1340
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,400
human community and that's never been

1341
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,760
seen before

1342
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,800
in our history you can revive old dead

1343
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,599
staples

1344
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,280
like zeolite you can revive it and trick

1345
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,280
out people because

1346
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,720
i you know because i got the word out

1347
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,400
there that people are

1348
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,760
they're filled with toxic heavy metals i

1349
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,839
got that word out there

1350
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,440
so hey it's perfect well zeolite could

1351
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,359
clean that up let's add that in there

1352
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,359
let's revive something that died a long

1353
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,400
time ago that very few people even used

1354
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,359
anymore

1355
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,000
let's bring it back in and try to say

1356
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,200
you could do

1357
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,480
that within you know i don't want to

1358
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,400
hurt anybody's feelings there's some

1359
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,760
really good people that are actually

1360
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,559

1362
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,559

1379
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,359
a lot only recipes a few extra tidbits

1380
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,359

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,559
i have all your other books okay you're

1382
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,400
answering now

1383
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,119
laugh out loud anything else i've

1384
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,440
ignored my line so here's the thing

1385
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,440
um this book right here i get it you're

1386
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,960
gonna think it's a new edition

1387
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,720
so maybe there's just a few tidbits

1388
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,640
thrown in and a few you know a few

1389
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,119
colorful recipes right

1390
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,240
but i went against the standard in

1391
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,400
publishing

1392
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,280
okay and i think i got my publisher

1393
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,480
upset

1394
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,319
probably i put a whole book in here

1395
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,720
so there's a whole books worth in here

1396
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,200
is what i did and that's why this book

1397
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,920
is

1398
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,200
one heavy and big book do you remember

1399
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,000
the old one

1400
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,680
the old one was light as a feather and

1401
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,200
yeah it was a great book it's saved

1402
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,800
millions of lives around the world with

1403
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,160
what it had in there

1404
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,920
this thing is a beast and uh

1405
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,920
it's got a whole book added to it

1406
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,119
entirely different situation

1407
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,079
um and when people realize that when

1408
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,880
they start reading it they're gonna be

1409
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,319
like oh my god

i mean i i like it because it's it's my

1416
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,640
dinner plus it's fun to do with you guys

1417
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,720
because i have you guys in my kitchen

1418
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:11,839
which is actually really fun um

1419
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,359
but uh this is just really fun

1420
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,280
i'm gonna plate this up i'm going to put

1421
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:18,160
a little fresh cilantro on top too if

1422
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,160
you guys don't mind

1423
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,160
okay i'm plating some of this up

1424
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,880
balancing female hormones there's a

1425
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,800
menopause chapter in the new edition

1426
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,559
you might want to check that out it's

1427
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,079
really really interesting

1428
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,480
yeah hormones get out of balance

1429
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,119
absolutely they do but there's more to

1430
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,240
why

1431
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,760
you get symptoms right it's not because

1432
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,000
a lot of the symptoms aren't because

1433
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,520
hormones are not balanced

1434
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,520
that's not the symptoms so when you get

1435
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,640
heart palpitations that's something

1436
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,040
else that's not hormones hot flashes

1437
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,720
that's a stagnant sluggish liver that's

1438
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,359
not hormones that's a stagnant sluggish

1439
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,280
liver

1440
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:02,160
but what happens is all these symptoms

1441
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,960
get passed off as menopause symptoms or

1442
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,680
hormonal symptoms when really they're

1443
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,119
not

1444
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,000
guys i'm just putting a little fresh

1445
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:12,640
fresh parsley

1446
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,280
a little bit on top of this like this

1447
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,280
just a little bit

1448
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,599
there you go nice little fresh so that's

1449
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,680
the plate right there

1450
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,960
that's the loaded potato hash i'm

1451
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,839
actually really excited it's got red

1452
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,559
bell peppers potatoes in there broccoli

1453
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,680
some asparagus it smells so good and

1454
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,000
there's no fat in there

1455
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,359
so it's like no artery building heart

1456
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,280
attack fat

1457
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,400
that you know that that gets everybody

1458
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,960

00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:28,319
out of the way so

1484
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,079
the good thing about this food is

1485
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,160
there's no oil

1486
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,559
put into this think about that a little

1487
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,160
bit there's no oil

1488
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:41,200
drenched in this meal there's

1489
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,480
there's no fat in this meal right think

1490
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,440
about that okay

1491
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,400
and what you're doing is you're getting

1492
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,440
glucose

1493
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,599
because of that to your brain to your

1494
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,839
heart you're getting glucose to your

1495
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,640
liver when you have all that fat

1496
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,280
drenched in

1497
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,240
soaking in your meals and in your food

1498
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,799
you don't get

1499
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,760
glucose to your brain easy it doesn't

1500
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,839
get there the fat

1501
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,119
blocks it and you can't get it there the

1502
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,799
way it needs to be

1503
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,040
so that's important there too so you

1504
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:10,960

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,839
minutes

1540
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,720
so courtney my daughter's eating i just

1541
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,559
saw that and

1542
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,240
then it went up there sorry i couldn't

1543
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:29,280
read the rest of it sometimes that this

1544
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,880
they just fly up um and it's hard for me

1545
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,720
to control it

1546
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,400
isabelle i had horrible hot flashes

1547
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,400
before i started following his

1548
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,440
recommendations it took about one year

1549
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,359
for me to heal

1550
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,200
i went full plant based and never look

1551
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:43,599
back incredible and look you guys

1552
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,040
medical medium can be plant-based and

1553
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,680
vegan

1554
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,040
right it can also be animal protein it

1555
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,520
could still heal

1556
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,640
so whatever if you if you're plant-based

1557
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,319
and vegan and that's

1558
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,160
what you feel compelled to go to and go

1559
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:59,040
that direction mm

1560
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,400
do it absolutely be plant-based be vegan

1561
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,720
absolutely okay

1562
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,160
and then all right if you want to stay

1563
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,440
animal protein

1564
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,400
then we do it right and you can do mm

1565
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,240
while doing animal protein okay because

1566
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,520
medical medium is not just plant-based

1567
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,760
it's for animal protein

1568
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,839
or plant-based it's for either ore and

1569
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,520
you can pick the side you want to be on

1570
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:21,520
you want to be plant-based and do it

1571
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,079
that way heck yeah we can do it all the

1572
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,520
way

1573
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,520
you want to do with some animal protein

1574
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,760
still can do it okay

1575
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,720
and because people who are plant-based

1576
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,280
still get sick

1577
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:33,119
unless they're doing it right unless

1578
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,640
they're learning how to heal plant-based

1579
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,760
and people who are animal protein still

1580
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,760
get sick

1581
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,359
unless they learn how to do it right

1582
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,119
