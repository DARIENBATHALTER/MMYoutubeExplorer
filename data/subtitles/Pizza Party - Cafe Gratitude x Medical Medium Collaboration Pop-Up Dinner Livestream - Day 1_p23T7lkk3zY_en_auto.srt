about 5 years ago um I I had read I had

53
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,400
read a couple of his books but I wasn't

54
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,599
committed yet and and I was trying to

lose the weight I just started feeling

59
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,599
different and it's it was the feeling

60
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:42,680

142

gathering with mm I went to the event in

143
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,240
Culver City back in June and that was

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,160
enormous there was thousands of people

145
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,240
so I'm stoked that it's more intimate

146
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,639
with the food right because whenever I

147
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,360
go to a restaurant I'm like hi do you

148
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,079
cook with canola oil and I can't have

149
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,240
any eggs or dairy and they're like why

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,360
actually eat the food and and know that

153
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,160
it's healing and it's also going to be

154
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,839
delicious yes healing delicious and

155
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,240

157
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,519
medical medium information so uh in 2019

158
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,120
I was super sick of the acne that

159
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,880
covered my face I had like very painful

160
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,760
cystic acne and a lot of discoloration

161
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,720
on my skin and I tried everything and I

162
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,600
met with a you know like a medical

163
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,199
medium coach that I found off Instagram

164
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,680
and so she's like girlfriend you need to

165
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,000
get off eggs you need to get off Dairy

166
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,639
and gluten like that was my whole diet

167
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,199
and So within like the first night I

168
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:57,639
said let's do it and so on July 9th of

169
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,760
2019 I was like let's go and it was

170
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,240
celery juice morning cleanse and I never

171
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,279
looked back and my skin healed it took

172
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,279
some time um but the acne is gone the

173
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,959
discoloration gone so I'm very very

174
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:14,160
grateful to mm's Spirit of compassion

175
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,360

176
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,920

179
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,000

180
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,680

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,399
mean I'm I still have my moments right

182
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,760
cuz I'm human but the heavy metal detox

183
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,079
smoothie really has helped alleviate

184
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:41,720
symptoms of depression and anxiety and

185
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,160
just like negative thoughts uh also

186
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,839
there's more of a feeling of being in my

187
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,800
skin like I'm at home in my body whereas

188
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,880
before there was a sense of like a

189
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,000
disassociation so it's been very helpful

190
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,600
mentally physically and it's also very

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,360
much elevated me spiritually because of

192
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,800
his focus on the angels and the

193
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,480
spiritual r

194
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,120
so it's like Mind Body Soul interesting

195
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,880
do you have any spiritual lessons that

196
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,920
you've learned uh through medical medium

197
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,720
information that you'd like to share

198
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,959
with us yes spirit is always with you

199
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,320
your angels are always with you and if

200
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,199
you're ever

201
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,360
feeling in a painful moment you can

202
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,600
always call upon the Angels you can call

203
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,480
upon Spirit you can call upon god and

204
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,720
goddess I'm very much about the divine

205
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,480
feminine a medical medium has helped me

206
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,720
really establish that relationship with

207
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,079
the spiritual realm yeah yeah beautiful

208
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,639
a lot of people talk about their healing

209
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,959
Journey also crossing over and being

210
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,720
quite spiritual as well yeah it's it's

211
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,839
I've always been a spiritual person but

212
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:45,360
the mm info definitely elevated that to

213
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:48,040
a different dimension so his information

214
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,199
about spirituality is very unique and

215
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,480
beautiful and pure and it definitely

216
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:53,959
serves the soul do you have a favorite

217
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,959
thing about medical medium information

218
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:58,279
that you would like to share with the

219
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,880

226
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,600
profound lessons have you learned from

227
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,079
your journey uh healing chronic illness

228
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,279
discipline is freedom you know

229
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,759
discipline sometimes seems like just

230
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:27,240
such a buzzkill obviously because you

231
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,079
have to Institute guidelines for your

232
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,160
behaviors and your thoughts but the more

233
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:34,399
that you do it the Freer that you are

234
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,240
right because then you're you're warding

235
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,399
off all of the things that don't serve

236
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,639
you and creating space for what does but

237
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,279
it does require discipline you know but

238
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,120
that ultimately creates a sense of

239
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,600
freedom and peace in the body mind

240
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,920

280
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,799
um and one big thing that I healed was I

281
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,199
had really bad acne for almost 20 years

282
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,559
being called pizza face and like Ring of

283
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,679
Fire I mean you name it and you know

284
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,400
they have you on every drug every potion

285
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,679
every lotion try this try that and until

286
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,439
I found out the root cause you know I

287
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,880
was able to heal that and also help

288
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,919
myself and my family too you talk about

289
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,520
your family so uh have you or your

290
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,799
family healed any other symptoms or

291
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,960
conditions using medical medium

292
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,720
information yes so my mom had a really

293
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,200
bad stroke in 2017 which left her in the

294
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,160
ICU for almost 30 days which is

295
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,039
obviously a huge deal and she had the

296
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,480
top stroke doctor on the northeast but

297
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,480
they didn't even know the root cause and

298
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,280
I would ask all these questions and they

299
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,720
were actually annoyed of me but it

300
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,440
wasn't until mm information were like

301
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,679
wow there is a reason for strokes and

302
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,400
this is the root cause and this is what

303
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,240
we we need to do and obviously you know

304
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,880
she's not perfect with mm but she does

305
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,559
the morning routine she's on a bunch of

306
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,360
supplements and she couldn't be stronger

307
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,120
than ever we didn't know if she was

308
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,960
going to live it was literally minute by

309
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,919
minute 30 days in the ICU and she's like

310
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,559
thriving you wouldn't even know he

311
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,600
wouldn't even know yeah that's

312
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,919
incredible that's such an inspiring

313
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,520

enjoy the medical Medan protocol

319
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,400
sometimes they'll give me problems but

320
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,039
you know you start off small so my

321
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,600
10-year-old now when she was three she

322
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,320

323
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,080
and now she's up to you know like a

324
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,799
coffee cup size of you know um of the

325
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,520
celery but I can see their progress as

326
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,360
well like they're rarely sick and if

327
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,840
they're sick it's for like 2 days with a

328
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,799
little cough it's not anything bedridden

329
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,400
or anything crazy like so many kids have

330
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,559
these days so it's just a beautiful

331
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,000

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,720
finally at a cancer doctor on May 17th

367
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,320
and she said I can't test you for

368
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,760
anything else I don't know what's wrong

369
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,360
with you she said I can't find anything

370
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,840
I said well is it fibromyalgia we're

371
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,679
just guessing and she goes well if you

372
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,240
want to call it that we can just call it

373
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,880
that I said you know I said I think that

374
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,200
I need to find something else that was

375
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,480
in May and I weighed 97 lbs and in on

376
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,919
June 16th someone came up to me at my

377
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,880
job and she said you need to read the

378
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,039
medical medium I ordered it from Amazon

379
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,640
read it that weekend on the 17th started

380
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,240
the celer juice on the 22nd of June and

381
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,880
it will be three years this year that

382
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,320
I've been on the medical medium and it

383
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,799
literally saved my life and it was

384
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,840
really because for me what it was was

385
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,320
that they were just taking so much

386
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,679
blood they took 60 vials in one week so

387
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,400
they were just taking out my whole

388
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,720
immune system and I was so I was just

389
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,760
skin and bones at the time but super

390
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,600
super grateful yes very grateful that

391
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,440
you're here and able to feel well enough

392
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,240
to be here and celebrate and have this

393
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,440
enjoy this beautiful dinner I'm so

394
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,039

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,760
you really can you talk a little bit uh

396
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,919
more in depth about the symptoms and

397
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,559
conditions that that healed from using

398
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,600
medical medium information you know

399
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,000
what's interesting I said one time I was

400
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
telling some of my friends that I'm here

401
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,799
with that I should have written

402
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,640
everything down that healed because so

403
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:38,640
many things went away that I didn't even

404
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,799
realize were were I you know you get to

405
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,159
a certain age you don't you just think

406
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,640
that they're just part of getting old

407
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,880
but all of a sudden everything starts

408
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,840
going away and you're going oh my

409
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,200
goodness they're so my throat was

410
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,880
closing up at the time but there were

411
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,880
just and all the joint pain went away

412
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,919
and then there was just lots of small

413
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,919
symptoms that just continued to go away

414
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,159
um stomach issues and so many many

415
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,360

foot pain in my side back pain

417
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,320
everything just disappeared the longer

418
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,640
that I've been on it well they may be

419
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,080
small but those things I feel like we

420
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,360
kind of tell ourselves oh that's it like

421
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,440
it's age or we just kind of live with it

422

00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,919
suffering more than 35 years for more

565
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,679

567
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:25,679

568
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,120
story as the most uh people in the mm

569
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:33,799
Community have have that um I tried

570
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,559
everything and um every every time I was

571
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:37,200
at the at the doctor's office they they

572
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,120

everything was perfect everything's fine

574
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,720
so it's just in your head and I knew

575
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,159
that it wasn't in my head and later on

576
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,440
when I was in my 40s then uh I started

577
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:56,120

it went more and more bad and worse and

581
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,200

all the way here to Los Angeles to be

700
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:43,280
here and attend this event I think it's

701
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,560
him medical medium It's s so it's it's

702
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,079
the spirit about it and the truth behind

703
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,119
it and I think it's the real truth and

704
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,720
it's like a banana you know how can you

705
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:56,200
describe somebody how a banana tastes if

706
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,400
you never have eaten one before so this

707
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,520
is medical medium try it and then you

708
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,720
know it yes and uh it takes time of

709
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:09,640
course it's not um an instant success

710
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:13,960
like a pill but um it's coming slowly

711
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:16,480
it's going slowly so um good things need

712
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,240
time and I think it's worth to to give

713
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,920
the time yes yes yeah well because we're

714
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,000

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,680
feel like connecting with people in line

726
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,640
tonight without words because we are we

727
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,839
are sharing the same passion we are we

728
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,440
we are having the same goal and I think

729
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:06,119
um it's an it's an uplifting spirit all

730
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,599
over here and I wish this for the entire

731
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,520
world and uh this is all I can I can say

732
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,280
yeah yes and how long have you been

733
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,640
using medical medium information for oh

734
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,760
I stumbled over it I'm an Pilatus

735
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,640
instructor and client of mine just said

736
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,520
you don't know Anthony William I should

737
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,680
know and so I uh looked it up on YouTube

738
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,240
and I was thinking okay wild blueberries

739
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,480
uhhuh and if you keep it a little bit

740
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,440
Frozen in your fruit salad it tastes

741
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,800
better and it's even better I tasted and

742
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:41,319
it was so so convincing and this is why

743
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,480
I started it and I thought I don't need

744
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,560
it actually because I'm

745
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,880
healthy but as more I went into it I

746
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,160
understood that um having symptoms is

747
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,520
The New Normal exactly been talking

748
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,800
about that tonight that you know we get

749
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,000
told we have these aches and pains and

750
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,119
we think you know it's staging right

751
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:07,200
it's just or hormones or yeah you you

752
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,920
have to take it if you are older or yeah

753
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,400
not even older even the the the the

754
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,400
little girls and boys they are suffering

755
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,960
so much they are having um belly ache

756
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,560
they are having headache so much often

757
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,880
they are growing up they are not feeling

758
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,839
well

759
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:29,599
it's in a way totally clear but to the

760
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,920
others who are not in that spirit yet

761
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,160
and I wish it's coming soon and more and

762
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,160
more

763
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,480
bold it will take time so so you talk

764
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,680
about some of those things that you just

765
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,920
thought were normal uh aches and pains

766
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,520
and things like that can you talk a

767
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,359
little bit of more about them and what

768
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,680
things lifted for you as you as you

769
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:50,319
started using the medical medium

770
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:55,319
information what things healed for you

771
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:58,000
um I thought my digestion is perfect and

772
00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:01,599
then I understood that the

773
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,760
digestion I had is not the normal for

774
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,960
example that you have much more action

775
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,079
in your body and that you can get rid of

776
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,720
things and you don't have to carry

777
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,520
things old things just like in life with

778
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,960
you so

779
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,000
sorry um but yeah you can you can get

780
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,240
rid of things which are not good for you

781
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,720
and so you you feel it you you feel

782
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,319
lighter you you feel more clarity you

783
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,880
you understand more things you get

784
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:33,119
deeper into the spirituality you can

785
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,880
talk better to people you understand but

786
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,839
for in every case uh in in any case is

787
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,880
it's good to to understand the

788
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,880
compassion behind it and so that you

789
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,599
understand we are connected and I think

790
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,800
this it's not a movement this truth is

791
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,359
just connecting us we are getting

792
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,200
rewired reconnected and I

793
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:59,839
think this is how we have to go for yes

794
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,839
reconnecting and I love that you say

795
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,440
compassion I feel that a lot in the air

796
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,400
this evening that everyone has that

797
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,319
compassion for one another yes yes I can

798
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,280
feel that too because you see you look

799
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:13,400
into the eyes and they are shining this

800
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,920
is there's a spark inside it's like a

801
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,839
Godly spark you see it finally because

802
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,079
if you I'm from Berlin here Berlin and

803
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:24,160
LA in a way you see the people are in a

804
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:26,359
way depressed they are walking like that

805
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,280
and since I'm teaching posture I can see

806
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:31,200
that as well in posture

807
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,800
and they are having so such a depressed

808
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:37,480
posture and if I see there are a in the

809
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,560
groceries only with chips this is not

810
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,920
okay today morning I was in the

811
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,760
groceries and a woman came and her

812
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,160
breakfast was just pulling on her chips

813
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,319
back to have this as breakfast so this

814
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,200
is for me in a way in former times I

815
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:56,800
thought okay why not it's not my way but

816
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,040
now I understand this is a big thing yes

817
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,000
yeah and what's your favorite thing

818
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,520
about medical medium information

819
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,000
H okay do I need to say one you can

820
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:13,359
share a couple okay um celery juice y I

821
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,160
hated it my friend was giving me a

822
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:19,040
juicer and the first thing what what was

823
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:24,000
coming out was I think a little short

824
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,280
glass from a big stock of of uh celery

825
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,440
and it was

826
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,359
disgusting and I was really

827
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,200
tempted to to give it up at the F in the

828
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:36,520
first day on the first day but I was

829
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:40,000
keeping I was I was go I was keeping

830
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,280
going and um the next is the heavy metal

831
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,760
detox the the morning routine I think

832
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,920
this is moving the needle yeah and then

833
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,800
if you are having if you are in this

834
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,640
state then it's getting by itself more

835
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,319
and more deeper MH yeah the morning

836
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,800
routine is great I feel like it doesn't

837
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,720
take that much time once you get into a

838
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,960
rhythm with it it's pretty good exactly

839
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:07,000
exactly so I I have to um commit that I

840
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,599
prepare for 2 days because I'm so busy I

841
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,280
I have really a lot things to do but

posible for me but uh yes I mean I'm

1051
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:49,240
just absolutely excited but Anthony may

1052
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,760
I ask you one question can Spirit tell

1053
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,119
me if the the dentist I have now is uh

1054
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,440
okay for me I was looking for a dentist

1055
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,319
more than 40 years and I what do you

1056
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,799
like

1057
00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:03,880
them spirit says you like them enough

1058
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:05,440
yeah I mean if he does good work that's

1059
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,240
the main thing for me to s on this

1060
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,559
things because my my teeth are

1061
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,280
completely destroyed and I'm really

1062
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:12,280
concerned about my teeth well you you

1063
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,119
you

1064
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,920
just just it it it it has to feel right

1065
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:21,319
one thing at a time you can get you know

1066
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,680
that you get done you know communication

1067
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:25,240
with them is important and you have that

1068
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,240
though like Spirit saying you have the

1069
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,319
communication with them and that doesn't

1070
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,799
that's not like that with all dentists

1071
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:33,520
most dentists communication isn't there

1072
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:35,760
they just want to get it done and then

1073
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,240
move you out but spirit says you

1074
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,160
actually have that communication with

1075
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:42,359
them yes okay so that means something

1076
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,520
okay do you want to get a picture Pa

1077
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,520

01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:13,960
talks that's kind well it's it's pulling

1261
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,960
a lot of stuff out that's why gets a lot

1262
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:18,559
of stuff out but I'm glad you're

1263
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:22,240
starting like into stuff yeah I've

1264
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:24,680
really been on a spiritual PA too and oh

1265
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,000
it's one and the same MH when you're

1266
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:29,480
doing information from a above it

1267
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,720
becomes just one and the same it's

1268
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:35,000
spiritual and physical it's not just the

1269
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,599
physical because the information comes

1270
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,079
from a source that's spiritual so then

1271
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:42,160
all these things happen spiritually

1272
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:43,520
while you're doing it that's true I do

1273
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,599
was just thinking that too because I was

1274
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,160
really on hor PL lately as I've done a

1275
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:50,359
lot of you know trying to kind of figure

1276
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,799
out things as I was you know going

1277
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:54,440
through different physical issues and

1278
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,680
then I came back around to oh maybe I

1279
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,640
should be going back into do that's more

1280
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,319
physically cling and yeah that's amazing

1281
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,480
well thank you for coming this is want

1282
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:06,960

1284
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,520
compassion have anything to say

1285
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,599
to it's okay to forget some certain

1286
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:19,200
things that you forget like spirit says

1287
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:23,200
you do forget certain things because you

1288
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:27,920
have so much going on the memory lapse

1289
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:32,000
is because you're trying to remember

1290
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:35,760
everything it's it's you're

1291
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,520

of everything you know what I'm saying

1293
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,240
so you have to it's okay to let some of

01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,039
the things go and be like you know what

1295
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,039
I don't have to have full control over

1296
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:48,599
every little thing I could let some

1297
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:51,440

able to receive and still am receiving

1308
01:02:18,279 --> 01:02:22,640
from you sharing this information that's

and um I've helped a family member

1311
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:29,440
similar to Cole your friend

1312
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,760
um through an addiction with detoxing

1313
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,920
with the protocols I was using for my

1314
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:37,119
thyroid somehow addiction is really hard

1315
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:38,680
and uh I'm I'm asking if I can I want to

1316
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,440
I'm wondering if the supplements and the

1317
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:43,720
protocols can be put together can they

1318
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,079
be combined to create kind of a

1319
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:49,200
something that can be put into rehab

1320
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:50,640
centers and help people um yeah I mean

1321
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,720
there maybe I could talk to some well

1322
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,160
that's well that's the thing I would

1323
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,400
just want to do it right if I do it well

1324
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:59,079
well I mean you have to like see what

1325
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,200
speaks to you too okay A little goes a

1326
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:03,640
long way that's what Spirit does say

1327
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,119
keep that in mind even with addiction it

1328
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,240
doesn't have to be the kitchen sink do

1329
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,640
have to be the whole doesn't have to be

1330
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,319
the whole kitchen sink with addiction

1331
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,160
that that's where we have to be careful

1332
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:14,000
CU my thyroid protocol helped her

1333
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,960
exactly exactly a little goes a long way

1334
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,200
with addiction spirit is just remember

1335
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,880
that so then you can pick and choose and

1336
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,760

spirit says that

1417
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,119
um um focus on a little bit more reading

1418
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,720
when that happens when you're when

1419
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:10,880

1421
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,839

reading yes do a little reading when you

1423
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:21,039
can like praying no reading reading a

1424
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,279
little bit more reading okay it takes

1425
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,160
your mind off of all these other things

1426
01:07:23,279 --> 01:07:27,039

Ascension I mean you've already got the

1447
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:30,040
karma beat that's a like like Spirit of

1448
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,600
compassion sees it different than Karma

1449
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:35,640
it's a different thing it it's not from

1450
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,199
Spirit it's not called karma it's

1451
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,279
something else that spirit always tells

1452
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:43,159
me about but but let's just say karma

1453
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:45,120
yes you got that taken care of okay yeah

1454
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:48,480

don't feel it

1459
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,799
you're right I don't okay but you

1460
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,319

1549
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,080

1669
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,239
too thank you okay I do have a question

1670
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,280
good to see I know good to see too how

1671
01:18:35,239 --> 01:18:40,920
much how much of a role does numerology

1672
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:43,360
play with the cleanses cuz 36 to always

1673
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:47,400
focus on it that always focus on it

1674
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:51,199
because um even with numerology because

1675
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:56,239
of Free Will with human beings with

1676
01:18:51,199 --> 01:19:00,400
angels okay and and um and even with

1677
01:18:56,239 --> 01:19:03,400
animals numbers shift it's not always

1678
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:06,159
this this absolute perfect number

1679
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:08,120
situation in the universe and and you

1680
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:11,520
know in the galaxies and solar systems

1681
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:13,679
and and Off the Grid on the grid so what

1682
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,760
I'm saying is that um but yes the

1683
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:18,800
numbers have meaning in the cleanses and

1684
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:21,520
they're very important and they do have

1685
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:24,960
meanings because there's when you go

1686
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:27,360
days on a cleanse yeah um your body is

1687
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:31,679
clocking those days and that number does

1688
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:34,000
land on a uh important factor okay when

1689
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,400
when cleansing so the numbers were for

1690
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,440
the cleanses were given from Spirit of

1691
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:39,159
compassion for a reason so yeah they are

1692
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,920
important but at the same time we can't

1693
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:44,880
get lost in all numerology because it

1694
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:48,080
can be a rabbit hole you know for a lot

1695
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,480
of people when it's shifting anyway

1696
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,880
right in many ways just because like I

1697
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,719
was thinking like do we have to

1698
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,920
visualize like with the 369 like is it I

1699
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,679
was trying to figure out like listening

1700
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,600
to your older podcast cuz you were

1701
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:59,639
talking about how there's three

1702
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,040
quadrants in the liver and there's

1703
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:03,040
another three another three so I was

1704
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:06,000
like is it called three that's always

1705
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:08,800
absolute that's always solid because the

1706
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,440
liver runs on what the liver runs on and

1707
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,440
those numbers really do hold true okay

1708
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,920
so all right you're so awesome what

1709
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,639
you're awesome too is there anything

1710
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,600
that Spirit wants to tell

1711
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:21,560
me I mean you know you're just always so

1712
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,480
positive and you need just just stay

1713
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:25,520
like you always stay on that posit

1714
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:28,159
positive note because honestly you have

1715
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:31,280
a big bright light and people like

1716
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:33,040
people get help from you yeah so just

1717
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,679
keep that light going keep it shining

1718
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:38,000
because it matters because you know

1719
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:39,480
you're helping people and all of that

1720
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,440
and if you feel down sometimes cuz

1721
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:43,920
spirit says you do feel down down

1722
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:46,760
sometimes okay you do get you know just

1723
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:49,040

1726
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:56,639

clockwork and it's all day long and so

1738
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,920
it just shows that I'm cleansing really

1739
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,440
heavily yeah a lot of people talk about

1740
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,760
they didn't realize gut health was bad

1741
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,920

even believe it it's incredible oh wow I

1809
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,480
I I have just a question I got something

1810
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:20,120
in my mind um about languages um did you

1811
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:23,120
think it's it's a good thing um to have

1812
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:24,760
so many languages I was thinking because

1813
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,280
I want to tell you something Jes or

1814
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:28,679
maybe SOC and I was thinking which

1815
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:30,880
language it's it's the best language and

1816
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:33,080
and also struggling sometimes with

1817
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:35,199
English or something and I was thinking

1818
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:38,159
is this a good thing so much languages

1819
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:40,280
on the world there there is it's a good

1820
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:42,480
thing okay but even though there's all

1821
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:45,280
these languages it's heart and soul

1822
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:47,880
still speaks the same you know that's

1823
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:50,719
that's all that's all tuned in on the

1824
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:53,960
human soul you know regardless and the

1825
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:56,360
human soul speaks through the person and

1826
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:59,080
so regardless of language so the

1827
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:00,719
barriers are broken by that so you want

1828
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:03,679

excited to to meet you I'm excited to

2103
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:05,040

2104
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:09,199
about the

2105
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:10,760
personalization um if people cannot

2106
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:14,159
experience

2107
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:16,040
emotions of Joy they're numb they numb

2108
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:17,520
but how come they can experience the

2109
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:20,080
fear and

2110
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:22,520
anxiety how come they can experience the

2111
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:25,679
because being numb can also be you can

2112
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:26,760
be numb and have fear and anxiety we can

2113
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,400
have all

2114
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:32,280
three yeah and it's hard to get out of

2115
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:34,280
that and takes time you know it takes

question about my walk so kind of

2344
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:54,360
stressed out during the walk but I have

2345
01:47:51,599 --> 01:47:58,480
lack off the to make a because the

2346
01:47:54,360 --> 01:48:01,159
current uh marketing is not good so it

2347
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:03,679

2348
01:48:01,159 --> 01:48:05,119
some suggestion from so or from you

2349
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:08,199

01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:18,440
you're not

2354
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:20,040
drinking I know that Dr Nesbit drinks

2355
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:23,360
but that's another story we won't go

2356
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:26,159
into that but um but no that's good okay

2357
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:27,320
but um spirit says electrolytes are

2358
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:30,080
critical

2359
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:32,800

2360
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,320

2361
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,280

make sure you always keep track of those

2905
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:34,520

2906
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:37,159
match them okay very important very

2907
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:39,760
important hey yes of course of course I

2908
02:13:37,159 --> 02:13:42,440
love you oh bless your heart I wanted to

2909
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:44,280
ask you a quick question about Erp shots

2910
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:46,199
cuz I know you've said about in the past

2911
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:48,159
if you inject something in the body that

2912
02:13:46,199 --> 02:13:50,440
it sees it as foreign so if you're

2913
02:13:48,159 --> 02:13:52,159
injecting your own blood in is your body

2914
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:53,760
going to recognize blood is forign is it

2915
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:56,840
safe to do is there something more

2916
02:13:53,760 --> 02:14:00,000
effective for Osteo thritis in

2917
02:13:56,840 --> 02:14:01,639
KN well you know it it it all depends

2918
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,520
like how like how long have you been

2919
02:14:01,639 --> 02:14:06,040
doing it um I didn't do it I wanted to

2920
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:07,679
see what you said about it I'm just

2921
02:14:06,040 --> 02:14:09,880
investigating PP

2922
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:12,840
shots I think look I mean you got to

2923
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:14,719
find a good doctor first of all for one

2924
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:16,760
and then you need to tell that doctor

2925
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:19,599
those those things and see what your

2926
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:21,880
doctor says like tell them well I heard

2927
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:23,679
this and this and this what do you think

2928
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:26,320
you know challenge challenge your doctor

2929
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:28,239
to get your doctor to think okay okay

2930
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:30,440
they had said no it's safe it's no I

2931
02:14:28,239 --> 02:14:32,840
know I know but say those things though

2932
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:34,719
and see and then go to another one and

2933
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:36,520
then ask the same thing and you it's

2934
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:37,679
always good to have a couple of doctors

2935
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:41,599

2936
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:41,599

02:14:58,199 --> 02:15:04,079

02:14:59,639 --> 02:15:08,599
you thank you thanks for coming yes um

2945
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:11,880
so I I've been uh I'm trying to get off

2946
02:15:08,599 --> 02:15:15,119
ssris for 12 months I tried I I weaned

2947
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:18,800
myself off successfully but crashed with

2948
02:15:15,119 --> 02:15:20,800
panic attacks depression crying anger

2949
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:23,760
and I just 12 months later I I went back

2950
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:26,239
on and I'm trying to get off uh what do

2951
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:28,199
I do well I axle specific are you doing

2952
02:15:26,239 --> 02:15:30,360
all these other things to counter it I I

2953
02:15:28,199 --> 02:15:32,239
was seeing uh a nutritionist I was

2954
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:33,239
trying supplements and it wasn't working

2955
02:15:32,239 --> 02:15:36,079
you're looking at the medical meeting

2956
02:15:33,239 --> 02:15:38,400
books and dig in there and and look at

2957
02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:40,960
things to counter okay you like things

2958
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:41,960
that you wouldn't expect uh but but but

2959
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,880
that's what you have to do you have to

2960
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:46,079
counter it so when you come off you're

2961
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:48,760
in a better place right okay there

2962
02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:52,920
there's information in there okay okay

2963
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:52,920
all right let's get a picture all right

2964
02:16:00,079 --> 02:16:05,880
yeah and it doesn't mean it's in the SSR

2965
02:16:02,679 --> 02:16:08,119
I think you just just other brain brain

2966
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:11,520
there's so much brain information so

2967
02:16:08,119 --> 02:16:13,320
many brain protocols just look at what

2968
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:16,000
you want to do in there see what comes

2969
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:17,559
natural but counter okay that's how you

2970
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,119
have to do you can't just go off that

2971
02:16:17,559 --> 02:16:20,760
and then you're not countering it yeah

2972
02:16:19,119 --> 02:16:22,920
yeah get some good Fe thank you thank

3206
02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:14,680
about the r canals on those and the

3207
02:27:12,359 --> 02:27:18,479

3208
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:21,040
V do you have a dentist you like what do

3209
02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:23,279

3213
02:27:28,319 --> 02:27:31,800
the dentist

3214
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:34,160
yes different dentists say different

3215
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:36,200
things yeah it's very

3216
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:38,359

02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:32,800
thank you so much you you I'm on the

3385
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:36,600
right track I know I'm on the right

3386
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:38,240
track now I'm healing there's there's

3387
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:40,279
yeah and you know remember three steps

3388
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:41,880
up two steps back sometimes right you

3389
02:35:40,279 --> 02:35:44,800
can get triggered two steps back but

3390
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:46,600
you're going up up up up and um and

3391
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:49,160
remember that okay that's important

3392
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:50,640
because when we're healing we sometimes

3393
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:52,800
can feel like we get kicked down a

3394
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:54,080
little bit and then we're swimming in

3395
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:56,359
that for a little bit but just to

3396
02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:59,080
knowing it move we move further even

3397
02:35:56,359 --> 02:36:01,600
more than before okay cuz that's what

3398
02:35:59,080 --> 02:36:03,880

doing what's going on nice to meet

3444
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:13,040
you so I have a question for you I have

3445
02:38:09,399 --> 02:38:15,840
only one kidney and um I wanted to make

3446
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:18,399
sure that I'm not doing anything with my

3447
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:21,200
morning sometime I have to drink all my

3448
02:38:18,399 --> 02:38:23,520
morning stuff really fast and I just

3449
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:26,080
don't know if I'm doing a little too

3450
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:28,880
much sometimes I want to make sure my

3451
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:31,760
kidney the one is taken care of because

3452
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:31,760
I don't want to take my

3453
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:36,760
husband remember I mean I talked about

3454
02:38:34,439 --> 02:38:39,359
this before with kidneys way too much

3455
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:41,319
protein is the bigger problem no no I

3456
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:44,279
know but you know that and that's good

3457
02:38:41,319 --> 02:38:47,120
okay that alone is critical always

3458
02:38:44,279 --> 02:38:50,080
remember that that alone is critical so

3459
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:52,680
um and then always always keep things on

3460
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:57,120
the Lighter Side that's all always you

3461
02:38:52,680 --> 02:39:00,120
know always um don't overfill the

3462
02:38:57,120 --> 02:39:01,680
tank okay cuz I do that sometimes you do

3463
02:39:00,120 --> 02:39:04,680
that sometimes just don't overfill the

3464
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:06,520
tank it's hard it's hard to not and if

3465
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:08,680
you do you do if you do you do don't

3466
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:10,760
beat yourself up I'm just saying just

3467
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:12,840

3738
02:51:50,279 --> 02:51:55,760
go away because it's really affecting my

3739
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:59,520
life your body wants to heal it does

3740
02:51:55,760 --> 02:52:01,800
okay and um I don't don't overthink

3741
02:51:59,520 --> 02:52:03,720
don't over stress even though things are

3742
02:52:01,800 --> 02:52:10,120
stressful I understand but but don't let

3743
02:52:03,720 --> 02:52:12,359
it say say look I I the stress is here

3744
02:52:10,120 --> 02:52:16,239
I'm not going to be a part of it in the

3745
02:52:12,359 --> 02:52:18,239
moment okay cuz stress does that's a

3746
02:52:16,239 --> 02:52:21,160

but um it's anything else I can do

3752
02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:33,840
there's a lot of things that happened

3753
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:36,200
where over the years it it could have

3754
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:38,439
been the on the flip side it could have

3755
02:52:36,200 --> 02:52:39,680

because when you prep all the food

4452
04:06:56,960 --> 04:07:02,479
yourself which I do all the time this is

4453
04:06:59,800 --> 04:07:04,479
such a break to just come out and have

4454

4613
04:22:22,640 --> 04:22:28,720
modality every diet belief system and

4614
04:22:25,720 --> 04:22:31,800
you know that pizzas aren't on that list

4615
04:22:28,720 --> 04:22:33,560
but pizzas are on the list now that's

4616
04:22:31,800 --> 04:22:36,159
the thing people should be coming here

4617
04:22:33,560 --> 04:22:37,760
to get these pizzas they're unbelievable

4618
04:22:36,159 --> 04:22:39,319
oh this is so exciting and it's been a

4619
04:22:37,760 --> 04:22:41,040
while since we last talked what have you

4620
04:22:39,319 --> 04:22:44,680
been up to lately what projects have you

4621
04:22:41,040 --> 04:22:48,080
got going on angs demons and spiritual

4622
04:22:44,680 --> 04:22:49,399
tools it's it's going to be mindblowing

4623
04:22:48,080 --> 04:22:50,960
when people actually hear the

4624
04:22:49,399 --> 04:22:52,960
information from above Spirit of

4625
04:22:50,960 --> 04:22:56,800
compassion answered a lot of questions

4626
04:22:52,960 --> 04:22:59,399
about afterlife after death it's a big

4627
04:22:56,800 --> 04:23:02,760
deal Angels Fallen

4628
04:22:59,399 --> 04:23:05,000
Angels uh something called Falling

4629
04:23:02,760 --> 04:23:07,720
Angels that's a big deal all on its own

4630
04:23:05,000 --> 04:23:09,640
like the information about the soul even

4631
04:23:07,720 --> 04:23:12,640
some stuff about ghosts like how you

4632
04:23:09,640 --> 04:23:14,359

believe in angels so many people don't

4650
04:23:54,119 --> 04:23:58,560
believe in so many different things but

4651
04:23:56,199 --> 04:24:01,720

4652
04:23:58,560 --> 04:24:04,439
one but but you got to be ready for it

4653
04:24:01,720 --> 04:24:06,880
the information is is it's a lot to take

4654
04:24:04,439 --> 04:24:09,520
in a lot to digest and it comes from

4655
04:24:06,880 --> 04:24:11,399
above basically what I did was I just I

4656
04:24:09,520 --> 04:24:12,920
asked a lot of questions and a lot of

4657
04:24:11,399 --> 04:24:14,800
questions and

4658
04:24:12,920 --> 04:24:17,960
the information came through and just

4659
04:24:14,800 --> 04:24:20,359
like you know medical medium fashion

4660
04:24:17,960 --> 04:24:23,720
it's it's a lot of

4661
04:24:20,359 --> 04:24:27,640
information and uh and doesn't just make

4662
04:24:23,720 --> 04:24:29,279
sense it's like it is unbelievable so

4663
04:24:27,640 --> 04:24:30,720
yeah yeah you know I was listening to a

4664
04:24:29,279 --> 04:24:33,399
snippet of that last night that you have

4665
04:24:30,720 --> 04:24:34,720
on Instagram and I went as soon as you

4666
04:24:33,399 --> 04:24:36,479
finished I was like wait I need to hear

4667
04:24:34,720 --> 04:24:39,080
more so I went on Spotify and hit the

4668
04:24:36,479 --> 04:24:41,680
pre save yeah okay cool cool yeah I I

4669
04:24:39,080 --> 04:24:44,000
hope I hope a lot of people you got to

4670
04:24:41,680 --> 04:24:45,640
sit down when hear it you got to

4671
04:24:44,000 --> 04:24:48,960
actually be sitting down when you hear

4672
04:24:45,640 --> 04:24:50,760
this information yeah and um I mean the

4673
04:24:48,960 --> 04:24:53,560
medical meme information or the medical

4674
04:24:50,760 --> 04:24:55,000
books but that's what that's what it is

4675
04:24:53,560 --> 04:24:57,119
and it's mixed in with some spiritual

4676
04:24:55,000 --> 04:24:58,880
information about the soul because when

4677
04:24:57,119 --> 04:25:00,439
you're healing the physical body you

4678
04:24:58,880 --> 04:25:02,680
also want to heal the soul there's a

4679
04:25:00,439 --> 04:25:04,640
combination of both and all that but the

4680
04:25:02,680 --> 04:25:08,439
medical medium books they are medical

4681
04:25:04,640 --> 04:25:11,319
books to get people you know out of the

4682
04:25:08,439 --> 04:25:14,640
woods get them into the light of healing

4683
04:25:11,319 --> 04:25:18,520
but this book book this

4684
04:25:14,640 --> 04:25:22,640
audio is a whole another thing this

4685
04:25:18,520 --> 04:25:24,640
isn't just about tools with nature and

4686
04:25:22,640 --> 04:25:28,040
you know and spiritual information about

4687
04:25:24,640 --> 04:25:30,119
the soul it's way beyond that and I

4688
04:25:28,040 --> 04:25:32,279
think people when they hear this they're

4689
04:25:30,119 --> 04:25:33,960
going to be like oh my God and it's

4690
04:25:32,279 --> 04:25:36,439
going to answer a lot of questions yeah

4691
04:25:33,960 --> 04:25:38,159
wow I can't wait how is it possible that

4692
04:25:36,439 --> 04:25:40,080
so many people have healed from

4693
04:25:38,159 --> 04:25:42,359
devastating chronic diseases through

4694
04:25:40,080 --> 04:25:44,399
medical medium most people most people

4695
04:25:42,359 --> 04:25:46,800
around the world there's no modality

4696
04:25:44,399 --> 04:25:49,520
there's no belief system in health

4697
04:25:46,800 --> 04:25:52,720
there's no any of that that can beat

4698
04:25:49,520 --> 04:25:55,319
medical medium information healing the

4699
04:25:52,720 --> 04:25:58,399
most people in the world it just is it

4700
04:25:55,319 --> 04:26:00,439
is just a fact it's just what it is and

4701
04:25:58,399 --> 04:26:02,479
and that's what's so incredible about it

4702
04:26:00,439 --> 04:26:05,040
I I think that also makes it challenging

4703
04:26:02,479 --> 04:26:06,760
because there's jealousy out there and

4704
04:26:05,040 --> 04:26:08,840
there's people out there in the health

4705
04:26:06,760 --> 04:26:12,439
movement that they don't like seeing

4706
04:26:08,840 --> 04:26:15,439
that nobody wants to see something heal

4707
04:26:12,439 --> 04:26:17,319
so many people like meaning people that

4708
04:26:15,439 --> 04:26:19,359
are actually out there in the industry

4709
04:26:17,319 --> 04:26:23,000
people in the industry don't want to see

4710
04:26:19,359 --> 04:26:25,520
millions of people healing from this

4711
04:26:23,000 --> 04:26:27,439
information because it just it just

4712
04:26:25,520 --> 04:26:29,920
really gets under the skin of so many

4713
04:26:27,439 --> 04:26:32,560
people in the industry but it's the most

4714
04:26:29,920 --> 04:26:34,800

for these events because people are

4821
04:30:35,680 --> 04:30:40,000
going to be getting another light Blast

4822
04:30:37,840 --> 04:30:42,199
from you tonight but for those who are

4823
04:30:40,000 --> 04:30:43,840
watching who are unfamiliar with it how

4824
04:30:42,199 --> 04:30:46,560
does a light blast work and can you tell

4825
04:30:43,840 --> 04:30:50,479
us about it light blast is something

4826
04:30:46,560 --> 04:30:53,199
that you know it's one of these things

4827
04:30:50,479 --> 04:30:55,600
where I wasn't sure if I could ever

4828
04:30:53,199 --> 04:30:58,279
really live up to what Spirit of

4829
04:30:55,600 --> 04:31:02,279
compassion you know wanted me to do with

4830
04:30:58,279 --> 04:31:04,720
this so I was trained really young and I

4831
04:31:02,279 --> 04:31:08,239
fought for it you know so if there'd be

4832
04:31:04,720 --> 04:31:09,680
a wounded baby bird that I would find

4833
04:31:08,239 --> 04:31:12,199
spirit of compassion would help me get

4834
04:31:09,680 --> 04:31:15,159
light to that bird and and we would

4835
04:31:12,199 --> 04:31:17,840
practice and and try to infuse you know

4836
04:31:15,159 --> 04:31:20,439
turtles that are injured birds that are

4837
04:31:17,840 --> 04:31:23,640
injured with broken wings the light

4838
04:31:20,439 --> 04:31:26,520
blast started really early on right and

4839
04:31:23,640 --> 04:31:29,479
but when I was you know 5 6 7 years old

4840
04:31:26,520 --> 04:31:33,600
8 years old I never dreamed or thought

4841
04:31:29,479 --> 04:31:35,800
of me doing being here today and doing

4842
04:31:33,600 --> 04:31:37,640
the light blast in here right now like

4843
04:31:35,800 --> 04:31:40,399
at 5 years old like that wouldn't have

4844
04:31:37,640 --> 04:31:43,119
really computed so it's been it's been

4845
04:31:40,399 --> 04:31:45,520
in kind of an elev thing where it

4846
04:31:43,119 --> 04:31:48,239
started where where I was really little

4847
04:31:45,520 --> 04:31:50,479
giving the light blast and then getting

4848
04:31:48,239 --> 04:31:53,880
a little bit older and and offering that

4849
04:31:50,479 --> 04:31:56,239
light blast to people not just animals

4850
04:31:53,880 --> 04:31:58,279
getting really good at what Spirit of

4851
04:31:56,239 --> 04:32:01,920
compassion wants me to do and wanted me

4852
04:31:58,279 --> 04:32:04,760
to do with that light blast and now all

4853
04:32:01,920 --> 04:32:06,439
the you know what it's developed into

4854
04:32:04,760 --> 04:32:07,920
and the decade after decade of doing the

4855
04:32:06,439 --> 04:32:10,279
light Blast for people and to be here

4856
04:32:07,920 --> 04:32:12,479
right now it's very special honestly it

4857
04:32:10,279 --> 04:32:15,640
really is and I never know if I can

4858
04:32:12,479 --> 04:32:18,520
actually you know do it that day or not

4859
04:32:15,640 --> 04:32:21,640
Spirit of compassion can I got to be I

4860
04:32:18,520 --> 04:32:24,880
got to be at a point in order to do it

4861
04:32:21,640 --> 04:32:26,319
it's it's intense um and yeah and I and

4862
04:32:24,880 --> 04:32:28,119
I talk about I've talked about this

4863
04:32:26,319 --> 04:32:30,520
before it takes a lot out of me but it's

4864
04:32:28,119 --> 04:32:33,359
it's worth it to see people move forward

4865
04:32:30,520 --> 04:32:36,080
and heal I mean the Miracles that

4866
04:32:33,359 --> 04:32:38,920

stuffed that's what I like to

4911
04:37:48,760 --> 04:37:55,400
say um when I think about

4912
04:37:53,000 --> 04:37:56,719
it when I think about like where you

4913
04:37:55,400 --> 04:37:59,039
guys have come

4914
04:37:56,719 --> 04:38:01,959
from and where you are

4915
04:37:59,039 --> 04:38:04,480
today it's it's pretty

4916
04:38:01,959 --> 04:38:07,000
mind-blowing how many of you were on

4917
04:38:04,480 --> 04:38:07,000
madress

4918
04:38:07,520 --> 04:38:11,719
island yep so you know what you know

4919
04:38:09,760 --> 04:38:15,879
what it's like you know what it's like

4920
04:38:11,719 --> 04:38:19,039
and you guys outside too right madress

4921
04:38:15,879 --> 04:38:21,799
Island yeah I

4922
04:38:19,039 --> 04:38:24,439
think it it's almost impossible for

4923
04:38:21,799 --> 04:38:26,799
somebody to understand what that is

4924
04:38:24,439 --> 04:38:28,480
unless they've experienced it themselves

4925
04:38:26,799 --> 04:38:31,520
unless they lived it

4926
04:38:28,480 --> 04:38:35,080
themselves it's really difficult to be

4927
04:38:31,520 --> 04:38:37,359
on matress Island and see the world go

4928
04:38:35,080 --> 04:38:38,760
by around you watch the world go by

4929
04:38:37,359 --> 04:38:42,000
around

4930
04:38:38,760 --> 04:38:43,240
you and people not understand really

4931
04:38:42,000 --> 04:38:45,639
what it's like unless they've been in

4932
04:38:43,240 --> 04:38:47,080
your shoes so when I think about anybody

4933
04:38:45,639 --> 04:38:49,520
who's been on mattress Island which

4934
04:38:47,080 --> 04:38:52,439
means you've just been in bed a long

4935
04:38:49,520 --> 04:38:54,400
time bed in bed a lot more you know what

4936
04:38:52,439 --> 04:38:56,561
I mean even if it's just a couple hours

4937
04:38:54,400 --> 04:38:57,920
during the day it's still a lot when you

4938
04:38:56,561 --> 04:39:00,920
see everybody else what they don't need

4939
04:38:57,920 --> 04:39:02,400
to take a nap right you see other people

4940
04:39:00,920 --> 04:39:03,879
out there well they don't need to slow

4941
04:39:02,400 --> 04:39:04,959
down they're up there they're outside

4942
04:39:03,879 --> 04:39:07,799
they're moving and grooving they're

4943
04:39:04,959 --> 04:39:09,680
doing things and then you watch that and

4944
04:39:07,799 --> 04:39:11,160
it's really hard when you've been

4945
04:39:09,680 --> 04:39:14,039
struggling and you've been sick for a

4946
04:39:11,160 --> 04:39:15,799
long long time it makes it really

4947
04:39:14,039 --> 04:39:18,000
difficult makes you feel kind of

4948
04:39:15,799 --> 04:39:21,400
alienated right makes you feel kind of

4949
04:39:18,000 --> 04:39:23,680
like whoa why am I not better how come

4950
04:39:21,400 --> 04:39:26,719
I'm struggling how come I'm

4951
04:39:23,680 --> 04:39:27,680
sick and so mattress isent is is

4952
04:39:26,719 --> 04:39:30,680
something

4953
04:39:27,680 --> 04:39:32,719
that is important to me because it's

4954
04:39:30,680 --> 04:39:34,719
about understanding chronic illness and

4955
04:39:32,719 --> 04:39:37,280
mystery chronic illness and when I think

4956
04:39:34,719 --> 04:39:39,160
about how many of you would not believe

4957
04:39:37,280 --> 04:39:40,638
you would be here today is there a few

4958
04:39:39,160 --> 04:39:41,920
of you guys that wouldn't believe you'd

4959
04:39:40,638 --> 04:39:45,080
be here today

4960
04:39:41,920 --> 04:39:48,080
but you are right you're here right now

4961
04:39:45,080 --> 04:39:50,600
in this moment pressing forward into the

4962
04:39:48,080 --> 04:39:53,160
future you know right on that edge of

4963
04:39:50,600 --> 04:39:55,760
time and you didn't think you'd be here

4964
04:39:53,160 --> 04:39:56,878
but you are and that alone is a big deal

4965
04:39:55,760 --> 04:40:00,480
all on its

4966
04:39:56,878 --> 04:40:03,040
own it's inspiring Beyond

4967
04:40:00,480 --> 04:40:04,718
inspiring I think it's difficult in the

4968
04:40:03,040 --> 04:40:07,200
health World these days and you see it

4969
04:40:04,718 --> 04:40:10,600
out there okay there's a lot going on in

4970
04:40:07,200 --> 04:40:12,878
the health world and I still think till

4971
04:40:10,600 --> 04:40:14,360
this day that chronically ill people

4972
04:40:12,878 --> 04:40:16,160
people with chronic illness people who

4973
04:40:14,360 --> 04:40:18,760
are sick with mysterious symptoms

4974
04:40:16,160 --> 04:40:21,520
conditions are swept under the carpet I

4975
04:40:18,760 --> 04:40:24,160
still believe it's happening I do they

4976
04:40:21,520 --> 04:40:26,638
don't get the respect they need I still

4977
04:40:24,160 --> 04:40:29,280
see that too the respect isn't there and

4978
04:40:26,638 --> 04:40:31,718
it's really really sad we got a world

4979
04:40:29,280 --> 04:40:33,320
where we just don't have some sick

4980
04:40:31,718 --> 04:40:34,958
people we got a world where we have a

4981
04:40:33,320 --> 04:40:36,440
lot of sick people now and they're

4982
04:40:34,958 --> 04:40:37,718
getting sicker and sicker I don't know

4983
04:40:36,440 --> 04:40:39,840
if you guys are seeing that out there

4984
04:40:37,718 --> 04:40:42,320
are you is everybody just healed in the

4985
04:40:39,840 --> 04:40:45,200
world or do you see people getting

4986
04:40:42,320 --> 04:40:47,160
sicker yeah no I know it's it's it's

4987
04:40:45,200 --> 04:40:50,240
crazy when you really think about

sicker out there interesting

4993
04:41:00,200 --> 04:41:04,320
right I think what happens is with

4994
04:41:02,440 --> 04:41:07,360
medical medum information is once you

4995
04:41:04,320 --> 04:41:09,200

what I mean did you guys get to that

4997
04:41:09,200 --> 04:41:11,440
point

4998
04:41:10,210 --> 04:41:14,080
[Music]

4999
04:41:11,440 --> 04:41:15,878
once you

5000
04:41:14,080 --> 04:41:18,280

done that you're seasoned you know and

5007
04:41:28,718 --> 04:41:32,520
that's the other thing the medical medum

5008
04:41:30,160 --> 04:41:35,280
community is the most seasoned Community

5009
04:41:32,520 --> 04:41:37,160
there is it's the most seasoned you know

5010
04:41:35,280 --> 04:41:40,160
group of people that have been there and

5011
04:41:37,160 --> 04:41:41,958
done that and tried everything and what

5012
04:41:40,160 --> 04:41:44,718
I've noticed about people in the medical

5013
04:41:41,958 --> 04:41:49,000
medium Community is they're seers they

5014
04:41:44,718 --> 04:41:51,480
see the broken glass out there they see

5015
04:41:49,000 --> 04:41:53,160
right the live wires hanging off the

5016
04:41:51,480 --> 04:41:56,760
telephone poles that you're not supposed

5017
04:41:53,160 --> 04:41:58,440
to touch they see all the potholes now

5018
04:41:56,760 --> 04:42:00,080
you know what I mean you stepped in

5019
04:41:58,440 --> 04:42:03,360
enough of them throughout your life

5020
04:42:00,080 --> 04:42:06,320
right and now you become this like Wise

5021
04:42:03,360 --> 04:42:08,958
Wise soul that sees things and you see

5022
04:42:06,320 --> 04:42:12,160
it clear that's the difference with the

5023
04:42:08,958 --> 04:42:15,718
medical M Community is you eyes become

5024
04:42:12,160 --> 04:42:17,798
spiritually empowered and can see things

5025
04:42:15,718 --> 04:42:20,040
and that is mind-blowing all on its own

5026
04:42:17,798 --> 04:42:22,958
I've watched that all through the years

5027
04:42:20,040 --> 04:42:26,600
through the decades really I've seen it

5028
04:42:22,958 --> 04:42:29,280
myself where now you guys are seers

5029
04:42:26,600 --> 04:42:31,280
that's what it comes down to you see the

5030
04:42:29,280 --> 04:42:33,400

right it's unbelievable and there's a

5054
04:43:29,000 --> 04:43:33,160
lot there's a lot more stuff out there

5055
04:43:31,600 --> 04:43:35,280
I'm sure you guys Tred did you try the

5056
04:43:33,160 --> 04:43:36,160
ionizer water that that would be the fix

5057
04:43:35,280 --> 04:43:38,840
it

5058
04:43:36,160 --> 04:43:41,160
all the alkaline water that would be the

5059
04:43:38,840 --> 04:43:43,718
fix it all

5060
04:43:41,160 --> 04:43:45,920
it just doesn't work like that you need

5061
04:43:43,718 --> 04:43:47,520
you need things your body really needs

5062
04:43:45,920 --> 04:43:49,400
to heal and it takes me to the next

5063
04:43:47,520 --> 04:43:52,520
thing I want to say is our bodies want

5064
04:43:49,400 --> 04:43:56,160
to heal they do they want to

5065
04:43:52,520 --> 04:43:57,718
heal they just need to get what they

5066
04:43:56,160 --> 04:44:00,760
need to do

5067
04:43:57,718 --> 04:44:02,120
so even if your mind's not there yet

5068
04:44:00,760 --> 04:44:03,520
here's the thing about the medical meme

5069
04:44:02,120 --> 04:44:04,920
Community too many of you guys who've

5070
04:44:03,520 --> 04:44:07,560
been through hell and

5071
04:44:04,920 --> 04:44:10,200
back your spirits were broken at some

5072
04:44:07,560 --> 04:44:12,120
point right were your spirits broken at

5073
04:44:10,200 --> 04:44:12,958
some point

5074
04:44:12,120 --> 04:44:15,920
and

5075
04:44:12,958 --> 04:44:19,080
then you needed to see the healing first

5076
04:44:15,920 --> 04:44:22,480
a little bit right before you were real

5077
04:44:19,080 --> 04:44:24,560
you started realizing wait a minute here

5078
04:44:22,480 --> 04:44:26,280
something inside of you said let me do

5079
04:44:24,560 --> 04:44:28,000
this medical medium information

5080
04:44:26,280 --> 04:44:30,320
something inside of you was like I'm

5081
04:44:28,000 --> 04:44:32,840
going to do this I heard about this one

5082
04:44:30,320 --> 04:44:35,000
person I heard what happened maybe you

5083
04:44:32,840 --> 04:44:37,560
know this book fell in my lap I'm going

5084
04:44:35,000 --> 04:44:39,958
to do some medical medium stuff but you

5085
04:44:37,560 --> 04:44:42,400
were already kind of busted up you had a

5086
04:44:39,958 --> 04:44:44,878
rough go rough road many people in the

5087
04:44:42,400 --> 04:44:48,240
medical medium Community have had that

5088
04:44:44,878 --> 04:44:49,718
but then you see a little bit of healing

5089
04:44:48,240 --> 04:44:53,160
and that's when all of a sudden you're

5090
04:44:49,718 --> 04:44:55,638
like whoa what is this I'm actually

5091
04:44:53,160 --> 04:44:58,760
starting to move the needle something is

5092
04:44:55,638 --> 04:45:01,240
starting to move the needle for me

5093
04:44:58,760 --> 04:45:03,798
something is happening here and then

5094
04:45:01,240 --> 04:45:07,120
then something just lights up inside

5095
04:45:03,798 --> 04:45:08,958
your soul gets boom a boost and it

5096
04:45:07,120 --> 04:45:10,638
starts to awaken and you're like you

5097
04:45:08,958 --> 04:45:13,120
know what I'm on the right path I'm on

5098
04:45:10,638 --> 04:45:14,560
the right path and then you run into all

5099
04:45:13,120 --> 04:45:17,878
this

5100
04:45:14,560 --> 04:45:19,600
crap all this crap for it you're doing

5101
04:45:17,878 --> 04:45:21,798
your juicing you're taking care of

5102
04:45:19,600 --> 04:45:23,680
yourself you're doing your mono eating

5103
04:45:21,798 --> 04:45:27,160
you're doing your 369 you're doing your

5104
04:45:23,680 --> 04:45:31,200
28 day cleanse you're doing the things

5105
04:45:27,160 --> 04:45:33,760
you need and you're getting like what

5106
04:45:31,200 --> 04:45:36,000
confrontation many people have gotten

5107
04:45:33,760 --> 04:45:37,920
confrontation oh you're doing that again

5108
04:45:36,000 --> 04:45:42,360
you're doing this again just go to the

5109
04:45:37,920 --> 04:45:45,638
doctor I've been to the doctor

5110
04:45:42,360 --> 04:45:45,638
how many you guys been to

5111
04:45:48,958 --> 04:45:53,760
doctors and I think that's a massive

5112
04:45:51,280 --> 04:45:56,958
misconception all on its own it's like

5113
04:45:53,760 --> 04:45:59,638
people think a sick person just didn't

5114
04:45:56,958 --> 04:46:02,120
get to the doctor yet a person who isn't

5115
04:45:59,638 --> 04:46:04,520
sick yet just thinks the sick person

5116
04:46:02,120 --> 04:46:06,920
just didn't get to the doctor

5117
04:46:04,520 --> 04:46:10,240
yet and that's something I've seen over

5118
04:46:06,920 --> 04:46:12,040
the years it's like get to a doctor you

5119
04:46:10,240 --> 04:46:14,080
should just go to a doctor get fixed

5120
04:46:12,040 --> 04:46:16,120
come on we need doctors there's some

5121
04:46:14,080 --> 04:46:18,760
great doctors out there but you know the

5122
04:46:16,120 --> 04:46:21,440
world just doesn't always work like that

5123
04:46:18,760 --> 04:46:23,320
it's not black and white when you got

5124
04:46:21,440 --> 04:46:24,320
symptoms and conditions and you haven't

5125
04:46:23,320 --> 04:46:26,760
been

5126
04:46:24,320 --> 04:46:30,798
well there's all these different gray

5127
04:46:26,760 --> 04:46:33,440
areas and gray zones and nuances and

5128
04:46:30,798 --> 04:46:36,120
details and that's another thing too

5129
04:46:33,440 --> 04:46:38,718
being heard with your symptoms when you

5130
04:46:36,120 --> 04:46:40,440

5131
04:46:38,718 --> 04:46:42,080

5142
04:47:01,920 --> 04:47:07,798
nuances the details it matters these

5143
04:47:04,240 --> 04:47:07,798
symptoms each one of them

5144
04:47:07,878 --> 04:47:12,160
matters and we go to the doctor we go to

5145
04:47:10,440 --> 04:47:14,280
two doctors three doctors have you been

5146
04:47:12,160 --> 04:47:16,958

5147
04:47:14,280 --> 04:47:19,958

the

5150
04:47:21,520 --> 04:47:24,400
specialist well you got to see a

5151
04:47:23,320 --> 04:47:26,160

other doctor it's not an easy Road it's

5155
04:47:31,600 --> 04:47:37,000
not and so something has to kind of

5156
04:47:34,798 --> 04:47:40,958
like take

5157
04:47:37,000 --> 04:47:44,558
over our Free Will has to now take over

5158
04:47:40,958 --> 04:47:47,000
and has be I need to heal I need to get

5159
04:47:44,558 --> 04:47:49,958
better I need to do something about it

5160
04:47:47,000 --> 04:47:53,200
it has to change for

5161
04:47:49,958 --> 04:47:56,440
me and then you wake up one morning and

5162
04:47:53,200 --> 04:47:58,320
you're like I'm done it's time to heal

5163

it's time to get better and then you

5164
04:47:58,320 --> 04:48:01,878
think about that thing somebody told you

5165
04:48:00,040 --> 04:48:03,958

04:52:25,320 --> 04:52:29,638
old and I'm like well what about me what

5268
04:52:28,558 --> 04:52:34,440

5270
04:52:34,440 --> 04:52:42,240

5271
04:52:38,760 --> 04:52:45,200
you can handle it I can

5272
04:52:42,240 --> 04:52:47,600
I don't know about that but seriously

5273
04:52:45,200 --> 04:52:50,400
really really old souls here for real

5274
04:52:47,600 --> 04:52:52,360
though that is no joke and that's true

5275
04:52:50,400 --> 04:52:54,760
and that says a lot all on its own so

5276
04:52:52,360 --> 04:52:57,718
that means that your souls contain and

5277
04:52:54,760 --> 04:53:00,040
harbor life experiences from every

5278
04:52:57,718 --> 04:53:04,240
lifetime it's in there it's locked in

5279
04:53:00,040 --> 04:53:04,240
there and this is another one

5280
04:53:04,280 --> 04:53:09,798
now and it's locking in there now but

5281
04:53:07,878 --> 04:53:11,878
this one's a little different this one's

5282
04:53:09,798 --> 04:53:13,920
about chronic illness this is about

5283
04:53:11,878 --> 04:53:16,680
having to fight your way

5284
04:53:13,920 --> 04:53:18,240
back having to heal after everything

5285
04:53:16,680 --> 04:53:20,878
you've been

5286
04:53:18,240 --> 04:53:23,520
through this one's

5287
04:53:20,878 --> 04:53:26,638
different this is about that emotional

5288
04:53:23,520 --> 04:53:29,280
struggle this is about really really

5289
04:53:26,638 --> 04:53:32,760
perfecting your soul in a different way

5290
04:53:29,280 --> 04:53:37,718
than ever before because sickness

5291
04:53:32,760 --> 04:53:39,798
changes everything it is by far the most

5292
04:53:37,718 --> 04:53:42,000
spiritual Soul growth that could ever

5293
04:53:39,798 --> 04:53:44,360
happen is through sickness and chronic

5294
04:53:42,000 --> 04:53:48,600
mystery illness there's nothing more

5295
04:53:44,360 --> 04:53:50,840
that can be any more powerful for

5296
04:53:48,600 --> 04:53:53,320
perfecting a soul for growing a soul for

5297
04:53:50,840 --> 04:53:56,160
spiritual growth and movement forward

5298
04:53:53,320 --> 04:53:58,840
it's chronic illness it's those symptoms

5299
04:53:56,160 --> 04:54:00,040
that's the big challenge it's different

5300
04:53:58,840 --> 04:54:01,320
when you're getting older and you're

5301
04:54:00,040 --> 04:54:02,638
getting older and then you have a heart

5302
04:54:01,320 --> 04:54:04,878
attack that

5303
04:54:02,638 --> 04:54:06,680
sucks that

5304
04:54:04,878 --> 04:54:07,718
sucks you're getting older you're

5305
04:54:06,680 --> 04:54:09,520
getting older you're getting older you

5306
04:54:07,718 --> 04:54:13,958
get type two diabetes and you you know

5307
04:54:09,520 --> 04:54:15,400
and that sucks it does you're 20 years

5308
04:54:13,958 --> 04:54:18,360
old and you're on mattress Island and

5309
04:54:15,400 --> 04:54:21,280
you're like what the is going on I'm on

5310
04:54:18,360 --> 04:54:23,798
mattress Island I'm 20 years old I'm 22

5311
04:54:21,280 --> 04:54:26,440
years old whoa there a whole different

5312
04:54:23,798 --> 04:54:29,480
thing going on there same thing if

5313
04:54:26,440 --> 04:54:30,680
you're 30 or 32 or 39 it's like whoa

5314
04:54:29,480 --> 04:54:32,280

5315
04:54:30,680 --> 04:54:34,080
my life man I'm supposed to be at the

5316
04:54:32,280 --> 04:54:37,520
best I've ever been I'm supposed to be

5317
04:54:34,080 --> 04:54:37,520
like at the top of my

5318
04:54:37,840 --> 04:54:41,480
game I'm not saying heart attacks are no

5319
04:54:40,480 --> 04:54:45,040
big

5320
04:54:41,480 --> 04:54:47,280
deal like I said they're they're no

5321
04:54:45,040 --> 04:54:49,120
fun but it's different with chronic

5322
04:54:47,280 --> 04:54:51,958
mystery illness and getting it young I'm

5323
04:54:49,120 --> 04:54:55,638
looking at a lot of young people here a

5324
04:54:51,958 --> 04:54:57,280
lot of young people here so think about

5325
04:54:55,638 --> 04:54:59,000
the spiritual growth and the level of

5326
04:54:57,280 --> 04:55:00,280
that spiritual growth and that has to be

5327
04:54:59,000 --> 04:55:03,718
respected and

5328
04:55:00,280 --> 04:55:06,360
appreciated first by you you you're not

5329
04:55:03,718 --> 04:55:08,120
going to like have an ego just because

5330
04:55:06,360 --> 04:55:09,798
you appreciate your spiritual growth

5331
04:55:08,120 --> 04:55:11,400
like it is at this point you're not

5332
04:55:09,798 --> 04:55:14,120
going to be like like egoed out just

5333
04:55:11,400 --> 04:55:15,958
because you appreciate where you are

5334
04:55:14,120 --> 04:55:18,320
with your healing and what you've been

5335
04:55:15,958 --> 04:55:20,440
through you have every right to hold and

5336
04:55:18,320 --> 04:55:23,080
wave that flag that you've been through

5337
04:55:20,440 --> 04:55:25,200
hell and back and healed or you're in

5338
04:55:23,080 --> 04:55:27,240
your healing process too with your

5339
04:55:25,200 --> 04:55:28,760
chronic illness you should be proud of

5340
04:55:27,240 --> 04:55:31,600
that you should be able to wave that

5341
04:55:28,760 --> 04:55:35,878
flag you should never ever think that

5342
04:55:31,600 --> 04:55:35,878
that's not a big deal it is it's

5343
04:55:36,240 --> 04:55:41,400

been hit by anything never had a

5359
04:56:16,638 --> 04:56:20,440

everything I was an alcoholic for a long

5741
05:13:28,240 --> 05:13:33,120
time because our people were in the

5742
05:13:30,760 --> 05:13:35,120
residential school system I'm PR I'm pre

5743
05:13:33,120 --> 05:13:37,798
First Nations from northern what they

5744
05:13:35,120 --> 05:13:41,160
call Canada and um there was a lot of

5745
05:13:37,798 --> 05:13:44,040
trauma and I have been an alcoholic all

5746
05:13:41,160 --> 05:13:46,760
my life and with the medical medium

5747
05:13:44,040 --> 05:13:50,280
information it actually helped me to get

5748
05:13:46,760 --> 05:13:52,718
rid of the Cravings which was profound

5749
05:13:50,280 --> 05:13:56,200
to me because I didn't know you can

5750
05:13:52,718 --> 05:13:59,240
actually cure yourself which it feels

5751
05:13:56,200 --> 05:14:02,600
amazing like I don't have to suffer

5752
05:13:59,240 --> 05:14:04,920
every day wanting that alcohol I've

5753
05:14:02,600 --> 05:14:07,000
worked so hard to try to find joy in my

5754
05:14:04,920 --> 05:14:08,600
life and there's days where I have it

5755
05:14:07,000 --> 05:14:11,320
and days that I don't but there's more

5756
05:14:08,600 --> 05:14:14,520
days that do have it now then before it

5757
05:14:11,320 --> 05:14:17,280
was also always so hopeless it's just

5758
05:14:14,520 --> 05:14:18,718
incredible very very incredible and so

5759
05:14:17,280 --> 05:14:19,760

good rest of your night can I give you a

5761
05:14:19,760 --> 05:14:23,958
hug

5762
05:14:20,760 --> 05:14:26,160
yes if I were to pinpoint when I became

5763
05:14:23,958 --> 05:14:28,638
sick it was when I was in seventh grade

5764
05:14:26,160 --> 05:14:31,520
and it was a pretty emotional time in my

5765
05:14:28,638 --> 05:14:33,600
life for the next 20 25 years I went to

5766
05:14:31,520 --> 05:14:36,480
so many different doctors from

5767
05:14:33,600 --> 05:14:38,760
conventional doctors to Natural doctors

5768
05:14:36,480 --> 05:14:40,360
I was kind of like I will try anything I

5769
05:14:38,760 --> 05:14:43,200
heard heard about celery juice and I

5770
05:14:40,360 --> 05:14:45,200
gave it a whirl and I could I felt an

5771
05:14:43,200 --> 05:14:47,638
immediate difference after even like a

5772
05:14:45,200 --> 05:14:49,440
day or two and then after two weeks I

5773
05:14:47,638 --> 05:14:50,760
kept on feeling better and just kept on

5774
05:14:49,440 --> 05:14:53,680
implementing more and more of his

5775
05:14:50,760 --> 05:14:55,200
protocols into my life and 7 years later

5776
05:14:53,680 --> 05:14:57,600
I've been drinking the celery juice in

5777
05:14:55,200 --> 05:14:59,200
the heavy metal detox smoothie I have

5778
05:14:57,600 --> 05:15:02,520
definitely noticed differences in my

5779
05:14:59,200 --> 05:15:05,200
brain and I've reversed about 95% of all

5780
05:15:02,520 --> 05:15:07,920
my chronic illnesses it's made a huge

5781
05:15:05,200 --> 05:15:09,600
difference in my life just in how I show

5782
05:15:07,920 --> 05:15:12,160
up in the world in general

5783
05:15:09,600 --> 05:15:13,718
and it's because I feel better for me

5784
05:15:12,160 --> 05:15:16,638
medical medium information is really

5785
05:15:13,718 --> 05:15:18,680
about empowerment it's about giving you

5786
05:15:16,638 --> 05:15:21,000
the sense of control with your own

5787
05:15:18,680 --> 05:15:23,080
health and healing when I was really

5788
05:15:21,000 --> 05:15:25,798
sick I went to doctors they all told me

5789
05:15:23,080 --> 05:15:26,958
I was fine my blood tests were normal

5790
05:15:25,798 --> 05:15:28,280
they was just like yeah you're just a

5791
05:15:26,958 --> 05:15:29,958
little stressed and in the meantime I

5792
05:15:28,280 --> 05:15:32,200
was like riddled with fatigue and pain

5793
05:15:29,958 --> 05:15:35,280
in my body it's obviously super

5794
05:15:32,200 --> 05:15:37,200
unconventional there's no formal you

5795
05:15:35,280 --> 05:15:39,040
know institutional thing that really

5796
05:15:37,200 --> 05:15:42,958
recognizes medical medium but if you

5797
05:15:39,040 --> 05:15:45,200
want to really heal from something that

5798
05:15:42,958 --> 05:15:47,840
people tell you you can't heal from

5799
05:15:45,200 --> 05:15:49,320
chances are you can and the chances are

5800
05:15:47,840 --> 05:15:52,920
you'll find that information through the

5801
05:15:49,320 --> 05:15:52,920
medical medium and you'll get your life

5802
05:15:53,160 --> 05:15:58,920
back I had um alterative colitis it's an

5803
05:15:56,958 --> 05:16:01,000
inflammation in the gut and you can't do

5804
05:15:58,920 --> 05:16:02,798
anything you don't have energy to do

5805
05:16:01,000 --> 05:16:04,840
things and you can take part in life

5806
05:16:02,798 --> 05:16:07,760
right you cannot do the things you love

5807
05:16:04,840 --> 05:16:10,160
and it's hard I've been plant-based

5808
05:16:07,760 --> 05:16:12,480
before but then I would still get sick

5809
05:16:10,160 --> 05:16:14,520
you know so I when I found Anthony's

5810
05:16:12,480 --> 05:16:16,240
information and his books I realized

5811
05:16:14,520 --> 05:16:19,240
there's so much more specific

5812
05:16:16,240 --> 05:16:21,840
information so many specific tools like

5813
05:16:19,240 --> 05:16:24,600
juices specific smoothies right celery

5814
05:16:21,840 --> 05:16:27,200
juice heavy metal detox smoothie using

5815
05:16:24,600 --> 05:16:28,798
these tools on a daily basis being

5816
05:16:27,200 --> 05:16:32,440
consistent

5817
05:16:28,798 --> 05:16:34,680
and that just yeah made a huge progress

5818
05:16:32,440 --> 05:16:34,680
uh for

5819
05:16:37,040 --> 05:16:41,958
me I had s thus I could barely walk I

5820
05:16:40,440 --> 05:16:44,080
could only walk like two to four steps

5821
05:16:41,958 --> 05:16:46,040
at a time where i' would have to stop it

5822
05:16:44,080 --> 05:16:48,760
was excruciating it would sometimes take

5823
05:16:46,040 --> 05:16:50,240
10 minutes to get out of bed um I I was

5824
05:16:48,760 --> 05:16:52,958
suicidal now I'm going to get weepy and

5825
05:16:50,240 --> 05:16:55,360
I don't want to but I was cuz the pain

5826
05:16:52,958 --> 05:16:57,920
was was unbearable so anyway I went

5827
05:16:55,360 --> 05:16:59,798
online and I looked up natural ways to

5828
05:16:57,920 --> 05:17:02,718
heal because I refused Pharmaceuticals I

5829
05:16:59,798 --> 05:17:04,480
refused a wheelchair and I stumbled

5830
05:17:02,718 --> 05:17:07,280
across the medical medium I I never

5831
05:17:04,480 --> 05:17:10,520
heard of him before so I now have all

5832
05:17:07,280 --> 05:17:12,718
his books I still eat the way he eats I

5833
05:17:10,520 --> 05:17:15,240
I I took out the oil I haven't gone back

5834
05:17:12,718 --> 05:17:18,440
to oil in 5 years now I'm great I mean

5835
05:17:15,240 --> 05:17:21,000
look at me I walked here and no pain so

5836
05:17:18,440 --> 05:17:23,040
for my journey I'm was really sick as

5837
05:17:21,000 --> 05:17:24,558
Anthony likes to stay on mattress Island

5838
05:17:23,040 --> 05:17:28,040
I was really suffering in a lot of pain

5839
05:17:24,558 --> 05:17:31,200
I had been to 30 plus Specialists with

5840
05:17:28,040 --> 05:17:32,958
what was Ms Crohn's neurological lime I

5841
05:17:31,200 --> 05:17:34,840
can't even tell you I just felt like I

5842
05:17:32,958 --> 05:17:36,558
was trying so many things and I wasn't

5843
05:17:34,840 --> 05:17:38,000
getting the relief that I needed and one

5844
05:17:36,558 --> 05:17:40,480
night I prayed to God and I said God I

5845
05:17:38,000 --> 05:17:43,878
can't I I really can't do this anymore

5846
05:17:40,480 --> 05:17:45,920
take this away from me and he gave me

5847
05:17:43,878 --> 05:17:47,840
like you know a thought he said celery I

5848
05:17:45,920 --> 05:17:49,760
said why does that sound familiar and I

5849
05:17:47,840 --> 05:17:52,480
watched a documentary with lovely

5850
05:17:49,760 --> 05:17:54,360
Anthony and it was heel and I remember

5851
05:17:52,480 --> 05:17:56,558
seeing his face and I thought I wonder

5852
05:17:54,360 --> 05:17:57,920
if he does consultations I didn't need a

5853
05:17:56,558 --> 05:18:01,120
consultations because he wrote those

5854
05:17:57,920 --> 05:18:04,160
lovely books him and so took that time

5855
05:18:01,120 --> 05:18:06,920
to write those Bibles for us so we can

5856
05:18:04,160 --> 05:18:09,200
be our own doctors and bring back you

5857
05:18:06,920 --> 05:18:11,480
know our own Sovereign right as human

5858
05:18:09,200 --> 05:18:13,280
being to be able to be healthy and to be

5859
05:18:11,480 --> 05:18:15,320
able to know and have the answer when I

5860
05:18:13,280 --> 05:18:18,080
first started I kind of Dove right into

5861
05:18:15,320 --> 05:18:20,080
it and did the 28 day cleanse and that

5862
05:18:18,080 --> 05:18:21,958
was amazing you know I had like lupus

5863
05:18:20,080 --> 05:18:24,520
rashes on my face that I used to have to

5864
05:18:21,958 --> 05:18:27,280
spend $300 on creams to try to get rid

5865
05:18:24,520 --> 05:18:29,360
of that went away I think two months

5866
05:18:27,280 --> 05:18:31,558
later was off all the thyroid medication

5867
05:18:29,360 --> 05:18:34,000
had thyroid disease I was off all

5868
05:18:31,558 --> 05:18:36,240
allergy medications I was off all

5869
05:18:34,000 --> 05:18:38,040
medications even the hormones um and

5870
05:18:36,240 --> 05:18:40,240
when I met with the doctors after the

5871
05:18:38,040 --> 05:18:41,798
pandemic there like you're off all your

5872
05:18:40,240 --> 05:18:43,000
medications and you know I was supposed

5873
05:18:41,798 --> 05:18:44,400
to have hysterectomies during that

5874
05:18:43,000 --> 05:18:46,760
period of time I canceled three

5875
05:18:44,400 --> 05:18:47,840
hysterectomies all of that healed and

5876
05:18:46,760 --> 05:18:50,480
they did the blood work and they're

5877
05:18:47,840 --> 05:18:52,360
Blown Away they couldn't believe that my

5878
05:18:50,480 --> 05:18:54,200
blood work was better than when I was

5879
05:18:52,360 --> 05:18:56,798
actually on the medication and they're

5880
05:18:54,200 --> 05:19:00,080
like hey you know how are you doing this

5881
05:18:56,798 --> 05:19:02,120
so it's amazing how much was turned

5882
05:19:00,080 --> 05:19:04,080
around in such a short period of time I

5883
05:19:02,120 --> 05:19:05,878
have a whole list of symptoms I'm still

5884
05:19:04,080 --> 05:19:08,400
working on and everything's getting

5885
05:19:05,878 --> 05:19:12,120
better but I think the main thing that

5886
05:19:08,400 --> 05:19:14,600
heal right away for me was addiction I I

5887
05:19:12,120 --> 05:19:17,760
was heavy on drugs and alcohol and

5888
05:19:14,600 --> 05:19:19,920
smoker and within the first month maybe

5889
05:19:17,760 --> 05:19:22,400
two months I completely all my Cravings

5890
05:19:19,920 --> 05:19:24,480
were gone after I started the protocol

5891
05:19:22,400 --> 05:19:27,160
so I've been able to go back to school

5892
05:19:24,480 --> 05:19:28,760
and now I'm on the path of becoming a

5893
05:19:27,160 --> 05:19:30,718
chemical independency counselor so I

5894
05:19:28,760 --> 05:19:33,638
could help others so it's also helped me

5895
05:19:30,718 --> 05:19:35,958
find purpose and yeah it's

5896
05:19:33,638 --> 05:19:37,840
amazing I was trying to go to the

5897
05:19:35,958 --> 05:19:39,680
previous events I couldn't because I was

5898
05:19:37,840 --> 05:19:42,240
bedridden at the time time I was

5899
05:19:39,680 --> 05:19:44,840
hospitalized again I fell for the fourth

5900
05:19:42,240 --> 05:19:46,798
time it is normal to feel discouraged

5901
05:19:44,840 --> 05:19:49,200
but for the first time I felt a little

5902
05:19:46,798 --> 05:19:51,040
bit more at ease because I had this

5903
05:19:49,200 --> 05:19:53,520
truth in me having this peace in your

5904
05:19:51,040 --> 05:19:56,080
heart is what'll allow you to heal

5905
05:19:53,520 --> 05:19:58,120
freedom from knowing the truth and

5906
05:19:56,080 --> 05:20:00,798
knowing that I wasn't crazy right

5907
05:19:58,120 --> 05:20:02,680
because unfortunately Society has

5908
05:20:00,798 --> 05:20:04,320
brainwashed us to not even know we're

5909
05:20:02,680 --> 05:20:06,240
deceived right and it's like how can you

5910
05:20:04,320 --> 05:20:08,320
heal if you don't know you're in the

5911
05:20:06,240 --> 05:20:10,280
position to be able to heal so it gave

5912
05:20:08,320 --> 05:20:13,000
me such a sense of relief it validated

5913
05:20:10,280 --> 05:20:14,320
all my questions all my Agony and I was

5914
05:20:13,000 --> 05:20:17,680
like you know what for the first time I

5915
05:20:14,320 --> 05:20:19,370
feel heard and I knew it was going to be

5916
05:20:17,680 --> 05:20:22,490
okay from that moment

5917
05:20:19,370 --> 05:20:22,490
[Music]

5918
05:20:22,718 --> 05:20:28,878
on when I first came across his first

5919
05:20:26,120 --> 05:20:32,000
book in July of

5920
05:20:28,878 --> 05:20:34,200
2016 uh I had already been searching for

5921
05:20:32,000 --> 05:20:36,920
answers for health issues for me and my

5922
05:20:34,200 --> 05:20:38,680
family for almost three decades so when

5923
05:20:36,920 --> 05:20:40,680
I came across that book it was just

5924
05:20:38,680 --> 05:20:45,040
another step in my research to try to

5925
05:20:40,680 --> 05:20:47,600
find answers and so when I opened it up

5926
05:20:45,040 --> 05:20:49,958
I noticed okay there's no bibliography

5927
05:20:47,600 --> 05:20:52,080
there's no footnotes there's no letters

5928
05:20:49,958 --> 05:20:54,680
after his name I read the first chapter

5929
05:20:52,080 --> 05:20:57,400
and saw where he got his information and

5930
05:20:54,680 --> 05:21:00,200
said okay and then read the book it was

5931
05:20:57,400 --> 05:21:02,878
the best medical book I'd ever read and

5932
05:21:00,200 --> 05:21:05,480
it actually gave answers and I just put

5933
05:21:02,878 --> 05:21:08,120
my hands up and said I finally found it

5934
05:21:05,480 --> 05:21:10,680
and now I can stop searching and start

5935
05:21:08,120 --> 05:21:11,958
learning healing and that's what I did

5936
05:21:10,680 --> 05:21:14,798
I've been using the medical medium

5937
05:21:11,958 --> 05:21:17,280
information since about 2019 into of

5938
05:21:14,798 --> 05:21:19,840
2019 I got the book as a gift for my

5939
05:21:17,280 --> 05:21:21,920
birthday and I read the first page and

5940
05:21:19,840 --> 05:21:24,558
that was it I was sold I knew this is

5941
05:21:21,920 --> 05:21:27,600
truth and I went with it

5942
05:21:24,558 --> 05:21:29,958
and everything has helped me in my life

5943
05:21:27,600 --> 05:21:32,760
physically mentally spiritually the the

5944
05:21:29,958 --> 05:21:36,080
whole thing a lot of depression anxiety

5945
05:21:32,760 --> 05:21:38,000
loss um betrayal stuff like that really

5946
05:21:36,080 --> 05:21:39,600
took me down for a long time and that's

5947
05:21:38,000 --> 05:21:42,240
where all the physcal things started to

5948
05:21:39,600 --> 05:21:44,000
happen gained a lot of weight and uh

5949
05:21:42,240 --> 05:21:46,360
everything just started to fall apart

5950
05:21:44,000 --> 05:21:47,760
when I came across Anthony's information

5951
05:21:46,360 --> 05:21:50,400
that's when it's slowly starting to get

5952
05:21:47,760 --> 05:21:52,120

5953
05:21:50,400 --> 05:21:54,600

05:22:06,400 --> 05:22:10,718
um I struggled with a lot of um chronic

5961
05:22:09,200 --> 05:22:13,760
illness autoimmune disease in my early

5962
05:22:10,718 --> 05:22:16,920
20s I had developed pots and chronic

5963
05:22:13,760 --> 05:22:18,878
fatigue and sibo and eczema and the list

5964
05:22:16,920 --> 05:22:20,680
can go on I had a lot of neurological

5965
05:22:18,878 --> 05:22:22,718
symptoms and I tried so many different

5966
05:22:20,680 --> 05:22:25,240
things to heal and in 2018 I found

5967
05:22:22,718 --> 05:22:27,000
medical medium information and within 6

5968
05:22:25,240 --> 05:22:28,080
months I was medication free and of

5969
05:22:27,000 --> 05:22:30,958
course my healing Journey has been

5970
05:22:28,080 --> 05:22:32,798
really messy with ups and downs but my

5971
05:22:30,958 --> 05:22:35,200
health has been very good thank God and

5972
05:22:32,798 --> 05:22:37,080
now um I'm pregnant and you know I get

5973
05:22:35,200 --> 05:22:39,680
to do all these things I didn't think my

5974
05:22:37,080 --> 05:22:42,558
body was capable of doing so

5975
05:22:39,680 --> 05:22:45,798
congratulations thank you I had thyroid

5976
05:22:42,558 --> 05:22:47,840
cancer I had my entire thyroid

5977
05:22:45,798 --> 05:22:49,878
removed and have been on thyroid

5978
05:22:47,840 --> 05:22:51,600
medication for a long time and since I

5979
05:22:49,878 --> 05:22:53,520
started medical medium I learned I could

5980
05:22:51,600 --> 05:22:55,440
heal that and I've been regrowing my

5981
05:22:53,520 --> 05:22:57,360
thyroid and slowly lowering my

5982
05:22:55,440 --> 05:22:59,440
medication which my doctors don't

5983
05:22:57,360 --> 05:23:01,120
understand and they keep testing me and

5984
05:22:59,440 --> 05:23:03,280
they're not they don't believe that it's

5985
05:23:01,120 --> 05:23:04,840
happening but it's happening and so

5986
05:23:03,280 --> 05:23:06,680
that's just the beginning right and

5987
05:23:04,840 --> 05:23:09,040
right now I'm healing even deeper parts

5988
05:23:06,680 --> 05:23:11,000
of me and healing my soul

5989
05:23:09,040 --> 05:23:12,920

5990
05:23:11,000 --> 05:23:15,638
something called complex regional pain

5991
05:23:12,920 --> 05:23:18,040
syndrome and I couldn't walk and um that

5992
05:23:15,638 --> 05:23:20,600
went on for a long time in my life and I

5993
05:23:18,040 --> 05:23:23,000
would go in and out a remission and it

5994
05:23:20,600 --> 05:23:26,040
was chronic chronic pain deep chronic

5995
05:23:23,000 --> 05:23:29,600
pain I have been on mattress Island a

5996
05:23:26,040 --> 05:23:31,680
few times in my life but here I am I

5997
05:23:29,600 --> 05:23:35,638
feel better than I when I ever did like

05:23:31,680 --> 05:23:39,320
in my 20s I mean this is phenomenal I

5999
05:23:35,638 --> 05:23:42,080
have been to pain clinics and and I've

6000
05:23:39,320 --> 05:23:45,120
been up and down the road with doctors

6001
05:23:42,080 --> 05:23:48,200
and needles in my spine and all kinds of

6002
05:23:45,120 --> 05:23:51,840
everything nothing nothing nothing

6003
05:23:48,200 --> 05:23:54,520
worked till I found this information

6004
05:23:51,840 --> 05:23:58,440
medical medium information and as soon

6005
05:23:54,520 --> 05:24:00,450
as I read the first paragraph I knew

6006
05:23:58,440 --> 05:24:03,360
that this was the

6007
05:24:00,450 --> 05:24:06,320
[Music]

6008
05:24:03,360 --> 05:24:08,600
answer I found uh Anthony's work about 8

6009
05:24:06,320 --> 05:24:10,200
and 1 half years ago I had a long list

6010
05:24:08,600 --> 05:24:12,920
of symptoms and things I've been dealing

6011
05:24:10,200 --> 05:24:15,040
with for over 30 years I'm a healthcare

6012
05:24:12,920 --> 05:24:16,878
practitioner I've been doing so many

6013
05:24:15,040 --> 05:24:19,160
things that it either helped me to a

6014
05:24:16,878 --> 05:24:20,840
certain degree or not helped at all as

6015
05:24:19,160 --> 05:24:22,718
soon as I found this work and delved

6016
05:24:20,840 --> 05:24:24,878
into it and started applying it I

6017
05:24:22,718 --> 05:24:29,000
haven't looked back I'm 100% in been

6018
05:24:24,878 --> 05:24:31,520
doing it all of it um for the eight half

6019
05:24:29,000 --> 05:24:33,878
years and uh it's literally changed my

6020
05:24:31,520 --> 05:24:35,920
life I know in my heart if I had kept

6021
05:24:33,878 --> 05:24:38,040
going the way I was going which was I'm

6022
05:24:35,920 --> 05:24:39,680
a chiropractor and a nature path so I

6023
05:24:38,040 --> 05:24:41,120
was kind of like a functional medicine

6024
05:24:39,680 --> 05:24:43,360
people now but I've been doing it way

6025
05:24:41,120 --> 05:24:44,840
before it was called functional medicine

6026
05:24:43,360 --> 05:24:47,480
and I just kept hitting a lot of dead

6027
05:24:44,840 --> 05:24:50,080
ends and so not only have I seen

6028
05:24:47,480 --> 05:24:52,920
Miracles with myself I've seen Miracles

6029
05:24:50,080 --> 05:24:54,718

6030
05:24:52,920 --> 05:24:58,080

6047
05:25:33,680 --> 05:25:40,280
in my feet but not after the first one I

6048
05:25:37,200 --> 05:25:42,160
think like around the fourth or so I

6049
05:25:40,280 --> 05:25:45,000
started feeling like almost like someone

6050
05:25:42,160 --> 05:25:48,240
is tapping under my feet yes and then it

6051
05:25:45,000 --> 05:25:52,520

can resonate with what he said you know

6146
05:29:44,440 --> 05:29:49,080
like everyone went through it and you

6147
05:29:47,240 --> 05:29:50,558

6148
05:29:49,080 --> 05:29:52,840
times but I was like no I don't want to

6149
05:29:50,558 --> 05:29:54,840
get emotional tonight you know because

6150
05:29:52,840 --> 05:29:57,920
it just kind of it brings you back to

6151
05:29:54,840 --> 05:30:01,200
like what you went through but we move

6152
05:29:57,920 --> 05:30:03,000
past it so and then if we encounter any

6153
05:30:01,200 --> 05:30:05,840
challenges like we know we have the

6154
05:30:03,000 --> 05:30:08,000
tools and we know what to do we have the

6155
05:30:05,840 --> 05:30:10,040
resources and how was your experience

hailed it has been interesting because

6165
05:30:30,600 --> 05:30:35,520
you definitely take two steps forward

6166
05:30:33,440 --> 05:30:38,440
three steps back or the Matrix just

6167
05:30:35,520 --> 05:30:40,718
throws things at you too like you know

6168
05:30:38,440 --> 05:30:43,878
to try to hold you back in some way or

6169
05:30:40,718 --> 05:30:46,040
go after you in some way but I mean

6170
05:30:43,878 --> 05:30:48,120
thankfully I have the tools and I've

6171
05:30:46,040 --> 05:30:51,000
been able to recover like whatever you

6172
05:30:48,120 --> 05:30:53,120

6173
05:30:51,000 --> 05:30:54,878

6174
05:30:53,120 --> 05:30:56,680

05:30:59,638 --> 05:31:04,798

6178
05:31:02,480 --> 05:31:06,320
right way to heal would you mind and do

6179
05:31:04,798 --> 05:31:07,558
you feel comfortable opening up about

6180
05:31:06,320 --> 05:31:09,600
some of those symptoms and conditions

6181
05:31:07,558 --> 05:31:13,240
you were dealing with yeah a lot of it

6182
05:31:09,600 --> 05:31:16,160
was from black mold exposure so I moved

6183
05:31:13,240 --> 05:31:19,798
into an apartment that was highly highly

6184
05:31:16,160 --> 05:31:22,280
toxic with black mold and it completely

6185
05:31:19,798 --> 05:31:23,878
changed just changed everything about

6186
05:31:22,280 --> 05:31:26,760
like how my immune system was how my

6187
05:31:23,878 --> 05:31:29,600
skin was so it was like eczema really

6188
05:31:26,760 --> 05:31:33,040
bad eczema just like weird skin

6189
05:31:29,600 --> 05:31:36,040
conditions bad brain fog memory loss

6190
05:31:33,040 --> 05:31:37,520
chronic sinusitis so and it just I've

6191
05:31:36,040 --> 05:31:38,480
never felt that way this it wasn't

6192
05:31:37,520 --> 05:31:40,120
normal

6193
05:31:38,480 --> 05:31:43,280
and I just went on a

6194
05:31:40,120 --> 05:31:45,320
journey you know to figure out how to

6195
05:31:43,280 --> 05:31:48,638
heal naturally cuz I wasn't going to pop

6196
05:31:45,320 --> 05:31:51,280
pills that wasn't in my nature and I

6197
05:31:48,638 --> 05:31:54,200
spent a lot of money put in a lot of

6198
05:31:51,280 --> 05:31:55,718
time and effort and nothing worked until

6199
05:31:54,200 --> 05:31:58,240
I found him and I was like this has to

6200
05:31:55,718 --> 05:32:00,958
work and I and it did everything made

6201
05:31:58,240 --> 05:32:02,558
sense so I just dove in yeah do you have

6202
05:32:00,958 --> 05:32:05,120
an encouraging message you would like to

6203
05:32:02,558 --> 05:32:09,280
share with the community that's watching

6204
05:32:05,120 --> 05:32:10,958
online oh man

6205
05:32:09,280 --> 05:32:15,600
I would like to share I mean this is

6206
05:32:10,958 --> 05:32:15,600
like a loaded question but I would

6207
05:32:16,200 --> 05:32:23,638
say just don't give up I mean every s

6208
05:32:19,718 --> 05:32:25,798
really cliche but just don't give up

6209
05:32:23,638 --> 05:32:27,958
and just dive deeper into the

6210
05:32:25,798 --> 05:32:30,520
information like listen to his older

6211
05:32:27,958 --> 05:32:32,958
podcasts they're extremely extremely

6212
05:32:30,520 --> 05:32:35,760
powerful and I tell that to people that

6213
05:32:32,958 --> 05:32:37,600
I know and that you know they're really

6214
05:32:35,760 --> 05:32:40,080
trying to heal and maybe they hadn't

6215
05:32:37,600 --> 05:32:42,360
been doing it that long and I tell them

6216
05:32:40,080 --> 05:32:44,958
listen to his older podcast literally

6217
05:32:42,360 --> 05:32:46,600
just scroll through all the way down he

6218
05:32:44,958 --> 05:32:49,480
shares so much information like if you

6219
05:32:46,600 --> 05:32:52,718
don't have the energy to like mentally

6220
05:32:49,480 --> 05:32:54,638
focus and read just and to just listen

6221
05:32:52,718 --> 05:32:57,200
listen to the older ones he shares so

6222
05:32:54,638 --> 05:32:59,240
many gems because I found him when we

6223
05:32:57,200 --> 05:33:01,638
didn't have all the books out there like

6224
05:32:59,240 --> 05:33:04,840

6226
05:33:04,840 --> 05:33:08,040

6228
05:33:08,040 --> 05:33:13,120

tonight's light blast it was really

6252
05:34:00,520 --> 05:34:04,680
interesting you know I this was my first

6253
05:34:02,520 --> 05:34:07,440
time doing it so it was very cool just

6254
05:34:04,680 --> 05:34:10,280
to like be in the presence of everyone

6255
05:34:07,440 --> 05:34:12,120
here you know but yeah it was really

6256
05:34:10,280 --> 05:34:14,360
nice was there anything that stood out

6257
05:34:12,120 --> 05:34:15,958
to you this evening with aw's

6258
05:34:14,360 --> 05:34:19,400
lecture

6259
05:34:15,958 --> 05:34:19,400
um I would

6260
05:34:19,558 --> 05:34:23,320
say trying to think of like a specific

6261
05:34:21,958 --> 05:34:25,080
moment I just feel like a lot of

6262
05:34:23,320 --> 05:34:27,480
different things that he said resonated

6263
05:34:25,080 --> 05:34:29,558
with me and so I think I just took like

6264
05:34:27,480 --> 05:34:32,680
different parts and aspects of what he

6265
05:34:29,558 --> 05:34:35,240
said and just took it into my own my own

6266
05:34:32,680 --> 05:34:37,878
being yeah how long have you been using

6267
05:34:35,240 --> 05:34:39,320
the medical medium information for well

6268
05:34:37,878 --> 05:34:42,558
I I learned about it through my mom

6269
05:34:39,320 --> 05:34:44,480
actually and so um I've been using like

6270
05:34:42,558 --> 05:34:47,000
a lot of wild blueberries like that kind

6271
05:34:44,480 --> 05:34:50,600
of stuff um no Dairy I've been cutting

6272
05:34:47,000 --> 05:34:52,240
Dairy out which helped my acne a ton um

6273
05:34:50,600 --> 05:34:54,558
and obviously that could be hormonal

6274
05:34:52,240 --> 05:34:58,080
fluctuations too but I think it just

6275
05:34:54,558 --> 05:34:59,400
helped on top of that yeah that's

6276
05:34:58,080 --> 05:35:01,120
incredible could you talk a little bit

6277
05:34:59,400 --> 05:35:02,680
more about the health issues you were

6278
05:35:01,120 --> 05:35:05,400
dealing with prior to using medical

6279
05:35:02,680 --> 05:35:07,958
medium information um I would just say I

6280
05:35:05,400 --> 05:35:12,480
was a lot more tired more like brain fog

6281
05:35:07,958 --> 05:35:15,680
for sure M yeah um acne mood swings

6282
05:35:12,480 --> 05:35:18,000
really like bad as well but other than

6283
05:35:15,680 --> 05:35:20,400
that that was you know it really helped

6284
05:35:18,000 --> 05:35:22,920
a lot yeah and a lot of that's lifted

6285
05:35:20,400 --> 05:35:25,878
for you you're saying yeah and I feel

6286
05:35:22,920 --> 05:35:29,360
like my energy has vibrated upwards too

6287
05:35:25,878 --> 05:35:30,558
so that's really helpful but yeah yeah a

6288
05:35:29,360 --> 05:35:32,360
lot of people talk about it being a

6289
05:35:30,558 --> 05:35:34,160
healing Journey but also a spiritual one

6290
05:35:32,360 --> 05:35:35,680
did you find that the case as well I

6291
05:35:34,160 --> 05:35:38,440
think it's all together it's like a

6292
05:35:35,680 --> 05:35:40,920
spiritual physical emotional

6293
05:35:38,440 --> 05:35:43,638
everything is just completely worldwind

6294
05:35:40,920 --> 05:35:45,080

favorite highlights from this evening

6356
05:38:09,160 --> 05:38:15,798
um I think hearing Anthony speak it like

6357
05:38:13,400 --> 05:38:17,400
speaks to my heart and speaks to my soul

6358
05:38:15,798 --> 05:38:20,000
because I've just been through so much

6359
05:38:17,400 --> 05:38:22,440
and so I think that was definitely one

6360
05:38:20,000 --> 05:38:24,120
of the highlights to the night just like

6361
05:38:22,440 --> 05:38:27,160
being validated and knowing that you're

6362
05:38:24,120 --> 05:38:28,798
not alone and knowing that

6363
05:38:27,160 --> 05:38:31,638
like

6364
05:38:28,798 --> 05:38:34,638
um people in the community have

6365
05:38:31,638 --> 05:38:35,958

it gets better and where you can heal

6408
05:40:21,440 --> 05:40:25,400
and yeah this is what what I what I want

6409
05:40:23,120 --> 05:40:26,520
to say it's it's a lot of Hope for for

6410
05:40:25,400 --> 05:40:30,920
everyone

6411
05:40:26,520 --> 05:40:35,320
here um I think that's great yeah no

6412
05:40:30,920 --> 05:40:38,360
it's great um I don't know I think uh I

6413
05:40:35,320 --> 05:40:41,440
think you should definitely just

6414
05:40:38,360 --> 05:40:45,040
keep reading the books and um keep

6415
05:40:41,440 --> 05:40:48,638
reading the living words because um I

6416
05:40:45,040 --> 05:40:53,280
think it's easy to Stray From the Path

6417
05:40:48,638 --> 05:40:55,400
and think you are healing all the things

6418
05:40:53,280 --> 05:40:57,320
that you're healing but there's so much

6419
05:40:55,400 --> 05:40:59,718
information to learn and there's so much

6420
05:40:57,320 --> 05:41:04,160
information to know and you can never

6421
05:40:59,718 --> 05:41:05,760
stop growing from from healing and yeah

6422
05:41:04,160 --> 05:41:07,920
I don't know I feel like there's just so

6423
05:41:05,760 --> 05:41:09,920
much to learn so just keep learning

6424
05:41:07,920 --> 05:41:12,080
and I feel like when you go back and

6425
05:41:09,920 --> 05:41:13,920
relist to things people were saying that

6426
05:41:12,080 --> 05:41:16,600
they learn or they get a different

6427
05:41:13,920 --> 05:41:18,240
message from that say podcast when they

6428
05:41:16,600 --> 05:41:20,280
relisten and hear it again a different

6429
05:41:18,240 --> 05:41:22,000
message or you know interpret it a

6430
05:41:20,280 --> 05:41:23,360
different way and I love that like

6431
05:41:22,000 --> 05:41:25,240
you're saying you keep learning and you

6432
05:41:23,360 --> 05:41:26,878
keep growing on this journey yeah

6433
05:41:25,240 --> 05:41:28,600
definitely definitely there's so much

6434
05:41:26,878 --> 05:41:31,000
there's so much and you definitely do

6435
05:41:28,600 --> 05:41:33,718
hear something different every time and

6436
05:41:31,000 --> 05:41:35,680
even Anthony says like keep listening to

6437
05:41:33,718 --> 05:41:37,240
this relisten to it the healing path

6438
05:41:35,680 --> 05:41:41,520
like relist to it listen to it again

6439
05:41:37,240 --> 05:41:42,760
again there's so many gems and um yeah

6440
05:41:41,520 --> 05:41:44,798
you can never you can never stop

6441
05:41:42,760 --> 05:41:46,040
learning so it's really nice what are

6442
05:41:44,798 --> 05:41:49,040
some of the things that you've healed on

6443
05:41:46,040 --> 05:41:52,000
your journey with medical medium

6444
05:41:49,040 --> 05:41:54,760
information um I'm still working on

6445
05:41:52,000 --> 05:41:58,440
healing a lot of things but I would say

6446
05:41:54,760 --> 05:42:00,840
that I've healed um a lot of my

6447
05:41:58,440 --> 05:42:04,878
OCD um chronic

6448
05:42:00,840 --> 05:42:07,478
fatigue I was like basically living in

6449
05:42:04,878 --> 05:42:10,798
on the couch and like in my room for a

6450
05:42:07,478 --> 05:42:13,200
really long time so I have like so much

6451
05:42:10,798 --> 05:42:16,478
more energy now and I can actually hold

6452
05:42:13,200 --> 05:42:19,040
a conversation with people and yeah I've

6453
05:42:16,478 --> 05:42:21,320
healed I healed a lot of emotional

6454
05:42:19,040 --> 05:42:24,120
trauma things that like I didn't even

6455
05:42:21,320 --> 05:42:26,638
think were possible to heal or work

6456
05:42:24,120 --> 05:42:29,040
through um so yeah I'm really really

6457
05:42:26,638 --> 05:42:31,638
grateful for that and excited to see

6458
05:42:29,040 --> 05:42:33,760
like how far I can go with healing yeah

6459
05:42:31,638 --> 05:42:36,080
what's next in your healing journey and

6460
05:42:33,760 --> 05:42:37,600
Tobias you talk a lot about your recipes

6461
05:42:36,080 --> 05:42:39,360
that you like online what are some of

6462
05:42:37,600 --> 05:42:42,760
your favorite medical medium recipes and

6463
05:42:39,360 --> 05:42:45,600
what is this medical medium glow oh the

6464
05:42:42,760 --> 05:42:47,840
so so I think um there's a lot of good

6465
05:42:45,600 --> 05:42:50,080
recipes I have to figure it out how how

6466
05:42:47,840 --> 05:42:52,000
to make the cookies uh the medical

6467
05:42:50,080 --> 05:42:54,080
medium cookies and what is about the

6468
05:42:52,000 --> 05:42:56,600
glow so I think when when you when you

6469
05:42:54,080 --> 05:42:59,080
get on the morning cleanse that means um

6470
05:42:56,600 --> 05:43:01,520
in the morning you start with the lemon

6471
05:42:59,080 --> 05:43:03,718
ginger or honey water then after that

6472
05:43:01,520 --> 05:43:06,320
you get the celery juice and then a

6473
05:43:03,718 --> 05:43:08,920
fresh heavy metal detox smoothie for

6474
05:43:06,320 --> 05:43:10,840
sure for sure you get the glow it it's

6475
05:43:08,920 --> 05:43:13,878
coming it's it's it's it's shining out

6476
05:43:10,840 --> 05:43:18,440
of you so can you give them a famous did

6477
05:43:13,878 --> 05:43:19,478
you now did you so yeah the famous did

6478
05:43:18,440 --> 05:43:21,280

6479
05:43:19,478 --> 05:43:23,558
Instagram videos right yes yes I say

6480
05:43:21,280 --> 05:43:26,400

6481
05:43:23,558 --> 05:43:28,320
from this to this with this and then I

6482
05:43:26,400 --> 05:43:30,120
say maybe with the mm glow routine or

6483
05:43:28,320 --> 05:43:33,080
something like this this the way how I

6484
05:43:30,120 --> 05:43:35,558
describe the stuff to um get people a

6485
05:43:33,080 --> 05:43:38,718
little bit curious and and maybe when

6486
05:43:35,558 --> 05:43:41,400
the people get curious try it and then

6487
05:43:38,718 --> 05:43:43,680
