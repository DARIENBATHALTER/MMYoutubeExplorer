00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,720
how many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health chances are whether

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,480
they show it or not most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,560
in your life do and chances are you're

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,400
one of them whether you're dealing with

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:25,880
anxiety depression endometriosis acne

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,439
eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,239
fatigue or any other symptom or

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,520
condition you're far from from

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:38,640
alone living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,719
The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,559
it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,199
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,440
Williams we're talking about

15
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,480
chumming and before you think about it

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,039
and you're like what is chumming just

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,120
know a lot of people do it they do it

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,079
every single day they don't realize

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,519
they're doing it but they're doing it so

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,879
why should I care about chumming or why

21
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,960
should all of us care about chumming

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,640
because it leads to chronic illness it

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,600
speeds up chronic illness it brings us

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,560
into chronic illness

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,960
flares the world is getting sick and

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,119
sicker because the world doesn't realize

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,280
it but they're chumming get ready for

28
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,479
this ride I say fasten your seat bels

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,360
for sure grab yourself a cup of tea if

30
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,360
you need to some herbal tea but I'm

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,720
telling you now this is going to be a

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,720
wild

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,960

fish

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
guts you don't know which one that is

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,760
you think that was the cow guts no

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,959
that's that's the fish guts Barrel okay

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,440
check pigs

51
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,920
blood that's the barrel filled of pigs

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,440
blood

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,959
yep okay good

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,800

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,239
all the fish heads right there there all

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,239
kinds of fish

58
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,280
heads Perfect all right get the barrel

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,959
ready bring it to the back of the boat

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,040
you got everything rigged you got your

61
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,959
fishing poles got your

62
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,920
Harpoon all right let's do this dump

63
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,720
that Barrel over okay oh just watch it

64
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,239
you splashed it on me

65
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,360
okay great I just love

66
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:11,560
chumming this is the best

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,000
part so when we're chumming out there in

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,879
the water and we're fishing we're trying

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,200
to get sharks or any kind of other

70
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:25,120
creature that actually loves the smell

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,519
of blood loves the taste of fish Parts

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
when we're chumming we're trying to

73
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,439
catch something same thing with trying

74
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,760
to catch crab

75
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:36,760
people who crab put bait in the

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,239
Trap The Crab Trap same thing with

77
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,439
lobsters you put bait in the lobster

78
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,040
trap because you're trying to catch

79
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,519
something and get them what people don't

80
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,519
realize is they're chumming every single

81
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,280
day they're chumming inside their body

82
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,360
but the difference is they're not

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,560
chumming so they can capture something

84
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,239
they're not chumming inside their body

85
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,519
so they can catch something and remove

86
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,760
it they're chumming every single day not

87
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,920
realizing it they're chumming to fatten

88
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,560
things up to feed something to feed some

89
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,120
type of creature but it's really not a

90
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,239
creature it's a virus it's a pathogen

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,040
it's bacteria they're chumming every day

92
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,880
and they're fattening up the viruses and

93
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,400
the

94
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,919
bacteria public medical research and

95
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,440
science you know what that is that's

96
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,759
stuff you see every day art articles out

97
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,320
there studies out there or so-called

98
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,000
studies cuz a lot of the stuff in the

99
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,080
study really doesn't match the article

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,440
and so forth but you see a lot of stuff

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,800
out there public medical research and

102
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,120
science it's doctors it's medical

103
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,560
schools that's public medical research

104
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,680
and science well public medical research

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,160
and science still to this day does not

106
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,600
know viruses actually eat they're hungry

107
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,919
they love the feed on food they also

108
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,800
don't know that viruses are a cell a

109
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,880
viral cell it's still in debate public

110
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,160
medical research and science thinks it's

111
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:15,680
like a strand of something maybe RNA or

112
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,800
something else they'll just make up

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,000
something too as the years go by to just

114
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,360
kind of go along with The Strand or the

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,600
fact that it's not living or the fact

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,280
that's not alive or doesn't eat public

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,840
medical research and science till this

118
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,199
day doesn't know what classified medical

119
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:38,919
research and science knows and what is

120
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,840
that bugs eat viruses eat public medical

121
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,199
research and science believes that

122
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,720
viruses are really just genetic

123
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,639
information what that means is they're

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,360
not alive they're not really real

125
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,880
they're not a viral cell so to speak

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,280
that's living they're just this

127
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:01,560
mysterious piece of DNA or RNA a strand

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,000
of something wrapped up in a tiny ball

129
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,120
in some situations basically just

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,960
something that doesn't really exist but

131
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,560
exists how can it do anything how can it

132
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,360
be a problem when it's not even real or

133
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,880
living classified medical research and

134
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,000
science they are wiser they know

135
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,000
something different and they laugh at

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,199
their colleagues the ones in public

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,599
medical research and science because

138
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,160
they know they're in the dark you see

139
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,039
it's not that public medical research

140
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,960
and science has been in the dark it's

141
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:40,120
just that they've been in the dark for

142
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,759
over a 100 years well over 100 years now

143
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,160
not just a year or 10 years or in the

144
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:49,080
dark on one thing they've been in the

145
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,639
dark about pathogens for over a hundred

146
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,680
years classified medical research and

147
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:58,960
science learned a long time ago that

148
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:02,720
viruses other pathogens feed they need

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,960
feeding to stay alive to keep them alive

150
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,879
in a lab to keep them under the

151
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:13,000
microscope they can't just exist and not

152
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,599
be fed they can't be supported and still

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,759
viewed tested and looked at and

154
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,960
monitored classified medical research

155
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,280
and science learned this a long time ago

156
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,680
when they discovered bugs when they saw

157
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,280
it under the microscope they saw it in

158
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,520
someone's blood they tried to preserve

159
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,400
those those

160
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,400
organisms they try to preserve those

161
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,680
pathogens so they could study them look

162
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,039
at them find out what makes them tick

163
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,599
they subjected the bugs they saw viruses

164
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,440
bacteria to a lot of different things

165
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,720
they noticed what would not keep the bug

166
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,199
around where the bug would just die and

167
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,080
be useless and no longer something they

168
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:01,599
can view or monitor or watch or grow

169
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,919
they used Mercury and realized Mercury

170
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:09,080
was a preservative it preserved the bugs

171
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:14,080
kept them alive kept them around but

172
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:16,080
they didn't know how or why it happened

173
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,159
they tried a lot of different foods to

174
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,240
keep the bugs going to try to

175
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:24,680
proliferate them grow them get them to

176
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,759
multiply and there was one food they saw

177
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,280
an unusual outcome real productivity and

178
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,839
it was egg

179
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,519
the egg became the number one food for

180
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
pathogens and bugs to keep them alive in

181
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,919
the classified medical research and

182
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,920
science labs and what they discovered

183
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:48,440
was the viruses would feed would fuel

184
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,160
themselves with that egg they would eat

185
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,920
the egg it kept them alive but more than

186
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,839
keeping them alive it kept them growing

187
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,800
rapidly so classified medical research

188
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:05,200
and science start at the assembly line

189
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,680
the actual pathogen assembly line you're

190
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,959
sick today because of what they did over

191
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,440
a 100 years ago because of that assembly

192
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:16,160
line that's why you're sick today

193
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,680
because you have a bug that they created

194
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,720
over a 100 years ago that's why

195
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,880
everybody is sick today that's why they

196
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,120
have all the chronic fatigue syndrome

197
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,399
and the seratic arthritis and the ra and

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,880
the Ms and so many other different

199
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,120
conditions and symptoms

200
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,120
it's because of classified medical

201
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,640
research and Science and what they did

202
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,720
over a hundred years ago creating the

203
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,399
bug assembly line classified medical

204
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,760
research and science wanted everybody to

205
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:49,079
be sick down the road they wanted people

206
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:53,040
to die and be maimed and be chronically

207
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:54,760
ill forever that was the plan and they

208
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,160
wanted public medical research and

209
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,000
science to not have a clue and to look

210
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,760
like idiots like they did all these

211
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,800
decades when someone came to the

212
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,240
doctor's office and they didn't know why

213
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,959
they were sick classified medical

214
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,160
research and science grew viruses docile

215
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,200
viruses ones that weren't really a big

216
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,959
problem they grew them they reshaped

217
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,680
them they mutated them they made them

218
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,560
aggressive they fed them they starved

219
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,440
them they made them hungry again and

220
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,839
they created monsters and they took

221
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,959
those pathogenic monsters and they put

222
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,399
it in animals they they watched the

223
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:35,160
animals live their life they watched for

224
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,600
symptoms and conditions and the animals

225
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,200
that showed symptoms conditions and

226
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,399
disease they then remov those viruses

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,560
out of those animals and then stuck them

228
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,800
back into other animals and fed them

229
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,240
again by feeding the animals what they

230
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,920
wanted to feed them they were raising

231
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,959
bugs and eggs and they were raising bugs

232
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,760
in animals and then back in eggs back

233
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,920
into animals back into eggs back into

234
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,880
animals until they found animals that

235
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,079
were getting really sick and really

236
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,279
diseased as the leading animals they

237
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,399
were taking the bugs from again they

238
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,720
wanted aggressive bugs bugs that did

239
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,399
destruction created even long-term

240
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,600
sickness created even death at this time

241
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,440
over 100 years ago public medical

242
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,519
research in science were churning out

243
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,760
doctors the doctors were studying

244
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,519
patients trying to heal them of their

245
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,240
sickness and at the same moment

246
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,279
classified medical research and science

247
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,240
was playing in biological

248
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,240
warfare the past is always forgotten

249
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,880
right now social media is all about the

250
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,160
present moment it's all about what's

251
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,880
happening in the moment not about how we

252
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,360
got here how did we get here in this

253
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,920
position now classified medical research

254
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,880
and science were doing biological

255
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,680
warfare well over a 100 years ago they

256
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,399
were developing monsters that they

257
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,480
planned on getting into humans to make

258
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,200
the chronic illness world what it is

259
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,639
today and a big part of how classified

260
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,600
medical research and science

261
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,480
accomplished this was they used animals

262
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,600
to Chum they were chumming inside

263
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,760
animals once they found out what a

264
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,639
pathogen a virus Lov to eat like eggs

265
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,000
for example they would feed the eggs to

266
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,839
an animal they plac the new virus in

267
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,079
once they were chumming chumming with

268
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,920
the food that the viruses love to eat

269
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,279
and the pathogens love to feed on once

270
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,240
they were chumming they would draw blood

271
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,760
and they would see an increase of

272
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,040
pathogenic material they would see an

273
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,199
increase of viral cells once they

274
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,160
discovered all the foods that viruses

275
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,839
would love to eat and fed on and fuel

276
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,839
themselves with then they knew they had

277
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,720
something here so then when they

278
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,440
released all of these man ufactured

279
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,240
viruses out there in the world they knew

280
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,440
they're going to be fed move us forward

281
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,240
over 100 years and people are feeding

282
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,920
their bugs they're feeding their

283
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,240
pathogens their viruses their bacteria

284
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,760
they're chumming every single day

285
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,480
they're chumming for bugs the difference

286
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,279
they're not chumming to catch the bug

287
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,040
and get it out of the body they're

288
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:26,240
chumming to feed the bug to get the bug

289
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,120
stronger to move bugs around the body to

290
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,240
get them hungrier for different foods

291
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,120
that they love and to make it so they

292
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,639
grow at a rapid

293
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,680
Pace look at the pig blood what look

294
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,680
what happens when it hits the water

295
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,600
anything

296
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:47,800
yet who what was that who shark fin here

297
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,040
it comes whoa whoa it just took that pig

298
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,920
head right

299
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:57,920
down oh my got another one who we got

300
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,800
sharks now lots of sharks whoa okay get

301
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:05,440
get the get the spear get the spear gun

302
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,880
ready who look look out whoa okay okay

303
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,600
just you got the fishing rods out just

304
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,800
in case something else is hungry too you

305
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
never know what you're going to catch

306
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,199
right here all right put the fish guts

307
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,880
out put the cow guts out put it all out

308
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:19,519
just keep on dumping it in it's like a

309
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,120
Feeding Frenzy oh look at that one whoa

310
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,199
look out all right all right all right

311
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,639
watch out watch out that one almost got

312
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,240
you just coming out of the water there

313
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,560
just be careful dumping

314
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,639
that people have viruses in them they

315
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,480
get them from their families their

316
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,800
parents pass down from generation to

317
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,519
generation that's why the whole genetic

318
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,320
thing with oh well I have a person in my

319
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,399
family that has the disease so I'm going

320
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,920
to have the disease my father had this

321
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,240
illness and symptoms so I have it or

322
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,120
maybe it skips a generation and then

323
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,759
someone else has it in a family line but

324
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,839
it's getting passed down passed down but

325
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:00,000
what people don't realize it's viruses

326
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:03,120
and pathogens going back well over a 100

327
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,160
years being passed down generation to

328
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,680
generation and so these viruses live in

329
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,680
our bodies they're there they're sitting

330
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,600
dormant many times inside people's

331
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,680
livers in their spleen in other organs

332
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,000
the liver does hold a lot of different

333
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,079
pathogens they could be sleeping it's

334
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,639
called dorcy they're dormant they're

335
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:28,120
actually not awakened they're sitting

336
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,120
there cells and they're incubating

337
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,440
they're alive they're staying preserved

338
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,959
but then they can be awakened things can

339
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:41,319
awaken them like chumming when we're

340
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:44,959
chumming when we're consuming foods that

341
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:47,720
awaken these bugs get them out of dorcy

342
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,440
sometimes we can eat foods that can sit

343
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,600
there and Float around them for years

344
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,560
but then one day the bug starts

345
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,480
Awakening and it sniffs the chum and it

346
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,920
goes for it I want it goes forward it

347
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,680
gets an appetite it starts to grow it

348
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,600
produces more viral cells and more viral

349
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,399
cells and more viral cell toxins and

350
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,279
then the chumming takes it to a level

351
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,720
where now we're getting

352
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,360
sick another thing is catching a bug

353
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,759
recently from someone catching a bug

354
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,399
from a shopping Carriage the handles on

355
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,040
it rubbing your eye catching a bug from

356
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,839
a door knob a toilet seat catching a bug

357
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,079
from just bodily fluids from somebody

358
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,600
else getting new bugs new bugs with

359
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:39,199
appetites new bugs that were feeding in

360
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,839
somebody else's body so somebody else

361
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,519
was chumming they were putting Chum

362
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,519
inside their body all the time feeding

363
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,800
those bugs those bugs are used to their

364
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,040
Chum and as those bugs are sitting

365
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,240
inside of you looking for food they're

366
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,279
looking for food they were raised on

367
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,360
food they like and enjoy so you might be

368
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,560
somebody that contracted or picked up

369
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,319
bugs from somebody else or some other

370
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,199
way and you got these new bugs new

371
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,520
viruses inside of you they're used to

372
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,760
somebody else's Chum when they're

373
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,439
chumming now they're hungry and they

374
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,199
want the food they were used to so they

375
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,839
start giving craving messages to the

376
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,199
person to the new host craving messages

377
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,039
they want the food they were used to

378
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,799
that they ate every day this is when

379
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,400
someone that doesn't eat a lot of eggs

380
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:35,000
ends up liking a lot of eggs and eating

381
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,320
them more they don't usually eat eggs

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,480
they eat them maybe once a month maybe

383
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,320
once every few weeks maybe once every

384
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,360
few months but all of a sudden after

385
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,960
being in a relationship for a while

386
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,039
being with somebody they contracted bugs

387
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,720
from or some other Avenue those bugs are

388
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,880
hungry and they want the food somebody

389
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,320
else used to eat all the time so then

390
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,960
the bug starts sending messages

391
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,240
information leeches out of the bugs they

392
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,320
excrete hungry hormones those hungry

393
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,320
hormones float around get to the brain

394
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,919
and trip up the hunger

395
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,880
senses somebody that didn't eat a lot of

396
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,360
eggs and they might have had their own

397
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,760
bugs in them too but maybe those bugs

398
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,280
weren't really tuned into eggs and that

399
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,600
person really wasn't a big egg eater but

400
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,919
now the new bugs they're getting real

401
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,880
hungry fast so they're sending those

402
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,679
signals and then the person's like I'm

403
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,400
in the mood for eggs now there's a few

404
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,559
different ways to catch pathogens bugs

405
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,960
viruses one is blood

406
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:39,799
transfusions that's a very popular way

407
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,039
if someone gets a blood transfusion

408
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,720
there's a good chance they going to pick

409
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,480
up a few different new bugs in their

410
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,320
system another one is public bathrooms

411
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,799
being careless in them another one is

412
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,320
shopping handles door knobs that's

413
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:58,840
another one too but sex is a big one

414
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,760
bodily fluid shared during sex out of

415
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,520
all these ways of getting pathogens sex

416
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,320
is the most popular it's the most

417
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,799
popular way and most common way to get a

418
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:15,880
pathogen so much so the pathogens rely

419
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:17,559
on it viruses and bacteria rely on sex

420
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,400
viruses have

421
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:25,280
information they retain information for

422
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:28,159
bugs to be living on past that host

423
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,720
viruses want bugs out of the host into

424
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:34,760
another host host that's one of viruses

425
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,799
and pathogens goals is to send pathogens

426
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,880
viruses bugs to another person and then

427
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:43,880
to another person that's

428
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,400
Survival that's the way the virus can be

429
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,679
guaranteed it's kind is going to survive

430
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,760
and live beyond that person that host or

431
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,559
that virus it's a pathogen survival

432
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,200
mechanism so when people have sex

433
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:00,720
intercourse or share bodily fluids it's

434
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,640
one of the great ways to guarantee that

435
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,600
survival so when there's a new host with

436
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,039
new viral cells in them we have to feed

437
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:15,200
them now the number one food after

438
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:18,679
having sex of any kind are eggs people

439
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,559
make eggs they do it the next morning or

440
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,559
they do it late that night or early

441
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,440
morning or it's the next meal they eat

442
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:28,200
but they always have scrambled eggs and

443
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,919
maybe nowadays one person might have

444
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,240
something else else they make themselves

445
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,400
some type of protein smoothie another

446
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,559
person will do something else but mostly

447
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,200
and most of the time there's eggs

448
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:46,159
involved scrambled eggs top of the list

449
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,080
it's a postex food it is a feeder it's

450
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:53,679
the ultimate chummer chumming it's to

451
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:57,520
feed the new viral cells the new viral

452
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,720
eggs the new viruses it's to feed them

453
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,760
to make sure they get a strong start and

454
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,960
they can root and they can have the

455
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,480
strength to

456
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,960
travel one of the reasons why people

457
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,279
fight so hard to defend their eggs is

458
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,360
because their eggs are keeping the bugs

459
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:17,200
happy they're keeping them solid they're

460
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,080
keeping them strong a lot of people out

461
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,080
there who have been sick with all kinds

462
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,039
of different symptoms all kinds of

463
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,640
different issues fight for their eggs

464
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,720
like nobody's business and then there's

465
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,440
people that aren't really sick yet but

466
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,039
the bugs are dormant and they're there

467
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,200
and they still need that food to feed

468
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,159
them to keep them going cuz dormy

469
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,799
doesn't mean they're totally asleep it

470
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,039
means they're still feeding but they're

471
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,919
staying lowkey waiting for a day to make

472
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,320
their

473
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:50,640
break people fight for their eggs like

474
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,720
no other they will go to the next level

475
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,279
they will do anything they need to do so

476
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,400
someone lays off of them about their

477
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,320
eggs you could tell them to stay away

478
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,880
from from meat they'll be fine with that

479
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,520
they'll go through their phases you

480
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,200
could tell them to stay away from Beans

481
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,039
they'll go through their phases you can

482
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,559
tell them to stay away from dairy milk

483
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,240
butter they'll go through their phases

484
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,240
and they'll stay away from it they'll

485
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,600
try it you tell them to stay away from

486
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,520
eggs and it's a fight it's

487
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Fierce you can mention hey go off a

488
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,080
gluten that would be a good idea and

489
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,960
they would be like you're right you're

490
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,360
right I should stay away from gluten

491
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,400
it's not good that I'm getting all this

492
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,640
gluten in me but then then you tell them

493
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,559
stay away from eggs and they'll look at

494
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,000
you and they'll get angry they'll hate

495
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,440
you one of the first things they'll say

496
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,080
is what do I eat then what am I going to

497
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,600
eat I have nothing to eat now what am I

498
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,279
going to do to replace my eggs what can

499
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,240
I get what can I eat tell me now I

500
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:53,960
learned long ago that eggs were a tough

501
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,600
one for people that getting them off of

502
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,760
eggs could be almost impossible no

503
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,200
matter how sick they were they going to

504
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:06,640
have 100 symptoms and when you bring up

505
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:09,039
the eggs they freeze up eggs are scary

506
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,320
removing them for so many people and I

507
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,120
knew this I knew that there's

508
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,880
possibilities of keeping the eggs in

509
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,760
there if we need to do other things and

510
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,760
keep on moving forward until their Free

511
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Will got strong enough to realize whoa

512
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,080
I'm feeling better CU of this maybe if I

513
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,000
take out the eggs I could really move

514
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,960
forward almost 25 years ago

515
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,080
my wife and I started an organic store

516
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,360
it was the first organic and wild food

517
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,360
store in the United States and back then

518
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,039
there wasn't such thing there wasn't

519
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,159
just an all organic health food store

520
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,600
with wild Foods included instead it was

521
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,600
mostly

522
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,760
prod departments had very few options

523
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,159
that were organic even in the best

524
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,799
stores around in our prodest department

525
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,919
was the first organic produce department

526
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:16,080
the first one to have 100% organic

527
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:19,240
produce in it the store was the first of

528
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,679
its kind the other thing we did was we

529
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,200
never put a markup on the organic

530
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,320
produce the produce department was at

531
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,279
Cost it's whatever we spent and then

532
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,080
that's what we would charge

533
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,279
we wanted people to be able to afford

534
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,679
organic produce now downstairs on the

535
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,600
other side of the building that the

536
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,960
store was in I had my office it was the

537
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,760
medical medium office and people

538
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,679
worldwide came to see me in that office

539
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,760
people traveled from all the different

540
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,200
countries in the world they traveled

541
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,880
from around the United States to see me

542
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,919
in person in that office to find answers

543
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,360
and to have me work and help help their

544
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:05,320
doctors with discoveries to what was

545
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,799
wrong after somebody's appointment we

546
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,559
would go upstairs to the store and

547
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,039
people would want to get things they

548
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,960
needed to help them heal so we would

549
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:18,279
walk around we would go into the produce

550
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,080
department and people would learn about

551
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:22,919
organic produce for the first time in

552
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,360
their life many of them and they would

553
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:27,600
know what foods were good for them they

554
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,960
would learn for the first time what to

555
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:34,320
eat to help them heal and what they

556
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,320
would ask all the time was can I eat

557
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,279
eggs can I still have eggs in my diet

558
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,360
and I would say of course you can but CU

559
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:43,679
you're suffering with all these

560
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,520
different conditions it's best not to

561
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,159
use those eggs to feed all the bugs the

562
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,200
very things behind your symptoms a lot

563
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,440
of people would panic and they would ask

564
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,720
me can you get eggs in the store can you

565
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,679
get organic eggs in the store since the

566
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,799
store's organic and I said yes so we

567
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,120
stocked eggs in the store for people so

568
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,399
we stocked the best eggs you can find at

569
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,559
the time in the store for people so they

570
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,480
had an option and like I've always said

571
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,960
and still till this day if you're going

572
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,480
to eat eggs eat the best ones you can

573
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,399
find if you raise them in your backyard

574
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,279
that's the ones you eat they're the best

575
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:24,080
ones you can find and there were local

576
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,720
small farms that were raising chickens

577
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,679
they were free range organic they were

578
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,080
feeding these chickens all or organic

579
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,360
food they would come to us and say will

580
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,360
you take our eggs will you stock them in

581
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,600
the store so people can get them and we

582
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,760
said yes of course because these are the

583
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:45,240
best eggs that are out there that we can

584
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:47,320
find local fresh free range organic eggs

585
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,799
because as I always said before I'm not

586
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,919
the food police I'm not telling you

587
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,399
don't eat this and don't eat that I'm

588
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,840
telling you if you have a pathogen or a

589
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:58,880
bug you're unwell and sick you have

590
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,320
these options just just like in the

591
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,320
medical medium anti-bug cleanse you can

592
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,279
pick your level if you need to keep eggs

593
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,200
in for now you keep eggs in for now you

594
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,080
can customize it for yourself you can

595
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,840
take the information and use it in the

596
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,960
way you need to use it and then

597
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,000
eventually you can go to another level

598
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,960
and say okay I'm ready to get rid of

599
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,600
eggs for now every day at the store we

600
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,360
would get requests they would phone in

601
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,880
they would show up at the store people

602
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,840
wanted eggs so we would get the best

603
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,399
eggs for them because they were going to

604
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,279
getg eggs somewhere else anyway and get

605
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,640
a bad egg we wanted to at least offer

606
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,240
them something they were hungry for

607
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,480
something they wanted something they

608
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,279
cared about Good Health they wanted the

609
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,279
best

610
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:45,679
eggs Spirit of compassion and I always

611
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,840
believe knowledge is power true

612
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:52,399
knowledge the truth is power it's

613
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,720
empowering so I put a sign next to the

614
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:57,679
eggs I put a sign right on the

615
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,880
refrigerator and it said eat at your own

616
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,159
risk

617
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,720
eggs feed pathogens they feed viruses

618
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,760
and bacteria inside the body if you're

619
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,279
someone struggling with an illness or a

620
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,519
symptom beware this could actually bring

621
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:16,320
it about cause a future flare and take

622
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,720
you to a place of poor health some

623
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,080
people were confused by this they did

624
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,840
not know what this meant remember this

625
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,159
is 25 years ago keep in mind now people

626
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,720
don't know what this means today and

627
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,600
there are a lot of people out there that

628
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,360
don't even believe in viruses today at

629
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,080
all even after covid and this was the

630
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,640
Dark Ages this was 25 years ago in the

631
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,840
health movement where were you 25 years

632
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,799
ago there are lots of different doctors

633
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,880
now on social media that are like 30

634
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:46,640
years old they were 5 years old when

635
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,279
this was going on there are influencers

636
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,080
now and podcast doctors and health

637
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,679
people on social that were in

638
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,159
kindergarten when this was happening or

639
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,720
not even born yet so let's get back to

640
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,360
the sign that was posted on the fridge

641
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,080
in the store where the eggs were a

642
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,159
couple people were really worried they

643
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,640
didn't know what it meant they didn't

644
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,760
understand pathogens or eggs with

645
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,799
pathogens or anything of the sort so

646
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,679
somebody thought maybe the eggs in the

647
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:17,000
refrigerator actually have salmonella

648
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,000
one day our store manager was over by

649
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,799
the egg Department over there and was

650
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,440
standing there talking to somebody the

651
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,840
person they were talking to was a state

652
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,279
official as a health inspector he was

653
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,519
reading the sign and asking questions

654
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:34,640
about it our manager explained the whole

655
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:37,799
thing about what it meant he laughed and

656
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,200
he walked out for decades I've been a

657
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,799
messenger a messenger of information

658
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,240
that's life-changing it's changed Health

659
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:49,120
itself out there I put up with a lot and

660
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,279
over the years eggs has been a big one

661
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,640
I've taken a lot of because of eggs

662
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,679
and remember I think I said this all the

663
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,000
way back many many years ago publicly

664
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,760
that egg eggs were my favorite when I

665
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,480
was a kid and that my dream was to have

666
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,640
an egg Shack a restaurant a little egg

667
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,000
Shack where I made eggs in all kinds of

668
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,440
different ways for people sunyside up

669
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,080
poached fried scrambled omelets

670
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,760
everything I thought it was the greatest

671
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,200
but messaging the truth about chronic

672
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,760
illness is the most important getting

673
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,399
people better recovering them getting

674
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,120
their lives back getting them out of

675
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:31,640
wheelchairs getting them back to life

676
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:34,720
back to work moving them forward healing

677
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,440
them it's the most important thing keep

678
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,720
in mind that 25 years ago that wasn't a

679
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,720
medical medium only store this was a

680
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,640
health food store that was servicing not

681
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:50,039
only the area but around the whole state

682
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,200
and Beyond it was a grocery store but an

683
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:55,559
organic health food market grocery store

684
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,760
and that means it was for everybody who

685
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,080
needed something it wasn't a iCal medium

686
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,000
only

687
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,639
store I want you to know I understand

688
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,880
how hard it is it's not easy when you

689
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:10,159
love a food or have an attachment to a

690
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,120
food especially since it could go back

691
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,440
to when you were a child when your

692
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,919
mother made you eggs your grandfather

693
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,200
made you eggs maybe a time where you

694
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,799
actually had eggs with somebody that you

695
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,519
love and care about eggs get attached to

696
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:28,799
our soul soul experiences these are

697
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,080
loving experiences more experien es of

698
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,240
comfort and it's a comfort food and I'm

699
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,919
not judging anyone and I've never been

700
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,720
hard on anyone about eggs I've only been

701
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:41,480
a messenger about the information of

702
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,639
what classified medical research and

703
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,639
science has done to our eggs and how

704
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:49,720
they manipulated them and how they fed

705
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:52,279
them to pathogens and got those

706
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,600
pathogens to become little monsters and

707
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:57,039
then they released those little monsters

708
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,360
onto the public over time so that people

709
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,679
would contract

710
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,000
those very little monsters and those

711
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,399
little pathogens those viruses those

712
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,519
bacteria those monsters they're now

713
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:11,200
feeding on Chum just like the classified

714
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,559
medical research and science want it to

715
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,559
happen they wanted people to be

716
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,240
oblivious and just eat whatever and feed

717
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,399
the bugs but eggs aren't the only food

718
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,480
classified medical research and science

719
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:28,039
fed to bugs they fed dairy products to

720
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,720
bugs they fed gluten to bugs they fed

721
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:34,120
corn to bugs they fed soy to bugs milk

722
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,880
cheese and butter and then there's toxic

723
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,320
heavy metals they fed bugs toxic heavy

724
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,600
metals they mixed the metals in with the

725
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,159
favorite foods the bugs loved they mixed

726
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,480
Metals in with eggs with milk with

727
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,799
cheese with butter with gluten the goal

728
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,399
was for people to Chum their bugs so

729
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,600
anytime somebody ate some of these Foods

730
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,480
these very foods that were fed to these

731
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,000
pathogens long long ago and any time

732
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,360
somebody ate them they were chumming

733
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,240
chumming their bugs that means bugs that

734
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,320
were sitting inside of them were getting

735
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,919
fed so someday they can rise up and

736
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,880
cause a problem the last thing someone

737
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,360

739
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,519

740
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,600
they weren't taught so they didn't know

741
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,639
and they don't know and classified

742
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,840
medical research and science will never

743
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:32,639
say a word they want people to not know

744
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,279
