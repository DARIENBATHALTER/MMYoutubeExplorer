00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,279
radio show where each week I talk about

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,640
the most advanced healing information

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,239
and secrets about health much of which

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,960
is not found anywhere else and is

10
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,760
decades ahead of what's out there now as

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,320
I've always said who has 10 or 20 30

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,879
years to wait for

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,480
answers and answers for pots you know we

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,559
need answers for

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,840
pots um so many people suffer for with

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,680
with it it's it's unbelievable what what

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,160
they go through you may be one of them

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,199
and you may have a mild rendition of it

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,920
you may have a serious rendition of it

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,320
either way this is the only Health show

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,879
so here where the information doesn't

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
come from medical interest groups

23
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,799
medical funding with strings attached

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,479
botched up research with the thumb on

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,159
the scale medical lobbyists internal

26
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:17,000
Kickbacks persuaded belief systems which

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,720
is sucked into every part of alternative

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,759
and conventional medicine private panels

29
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,759
of influencers health field payoffs or

30
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:29,479
trendy traps the information here is

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,560
pure it comes untampered with from a

32
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,880
clean source to me higher source I call

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
Spirit of

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,119
compassion and that's very important to

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,960
know about and you're going to know that

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,000
when we talk about pots why this has to

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,960
be pure information and why it can't be

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,119
agenda driven information that's

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,119
contaminated both conventionally and

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,079
alternatively in the world that there

41
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,719
I'm talking about doctors doctors are

42
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,920

43
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,719
surgeons sure doctors you know the best

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,560
thing ever you can do is you know you go

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,000
to your doctor when you see your doctor

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,920

critically important for sure I've known

63
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,120
uh hundreds and hundreds of them over

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,680
the years and it's and you you know and

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,239
and listen it's about the information we

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,239
talk about on the show medical medium if

67
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,959
this is the first time that you've come

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,720
to the medical Medium show um what I

69
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,159
mean by pure information I mean this

70
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,200
information hasn't been misguided by

71
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,200
funding or something you know that's

72
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,480
Twisted it or something like that for

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,519
example autoimmune autoimmune we're

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,840
talking about pots right and pots is

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,120
considered an autoimmune syndrome

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,280
autoimmune disease autoimmune condition

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,920
right that's what is considered well

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,040
first of all

79
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,599
autoimmune isn't even right the body

80
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,280
attacking self isn't even right and that

81
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,400
contamination from that misguided theory

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,920
that became

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,840
law that has poisoned poisoned literally

84
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,560
the medical systems both alternative and

85
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,760
conventional and I I had to write a

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,519
chapter about it in the thyroid healing

87
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,879
book I just couldn't help myself I had

88
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,599
to I had to because it's still that

89
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,239
poisonous toxic and still it's ruining

90
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,640
people's lives in many ways you don't

91
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,920
think it is oh it is if you're new to

92
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,760
the show and don't realize this no it is

93
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,799
cuz if you think your body is destroying

94
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,280
itself creating your illness causing

95
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,560
your illness attacking yourself

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,519
attacking your nervous system whatever

97
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,360
it's attacking if you think that's what

98
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,040
it's

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,760
doing that's not going to help you

100
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,159
heal it's going to kick you down a

101
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,920
notch because it's wrong to begin with

102
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,639
it's not even

103
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,199
correct and and if it was correct it

104
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,000
still would it still would kick you down

105
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,320
a notch of course it would but it's not

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,040
correct it's not even real we're going

107
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,440
to talk about why and how it's not real

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,600
and everything else it's important to

109
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,840
know the autoimmune great mistake I call

110
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,520
it the first great

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,479
mistake of all time the first great

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,360
mistake and you'll see in the thyroid

113
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,840
healing Book You'll see there's a whole

114
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,080
bunch of great mistakes that I that I

115
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,360
write about that I clarify that I

116
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,919
Rectify that I clarify very important to

117
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,520
know that very important to know because

118
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,360
when you read them you'll see oh my God

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,919
this is a great mistake oh my God I

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,479
understand now it's important to not for

121
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:01,479
your healing because great mistakes that

122
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,199
are corrupted that Ru the gamma in the

123
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:07,639
health field these great mistakes they

124
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,680
stop people from healing they stop

125
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:14,320
people from healing darn right that's

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,960
what they do and if you don't know that

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,479
that's not good you got to know that

128
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,160
it's important to know that it's really

129
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,600
important to know that an autoimmune the

130
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,479
autoimmune Theory the great mistake of

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,000
autoimmune because it was created

132
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,199
because the medical industry doesn't

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,160
know what causes pots

134
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,600
it doesn't know what causes lupus it

135
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,520
doesn't know what causes Ms it doesn't

136
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,759
know what causes Hashimoto we know what

137
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,520
causes those but the thyroid healing

138
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,440
book I I put it right out there so the

139
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,840
world will change so that you take the

140
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,720
book and you tell somebody about it so

141
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,199
that you bump into somebody like look

142
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,880
you got to get this book because you

143
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,199
need to know what's going on or here

144
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,840
borrow my book so somebody else

145
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:04,479
learns and because because the the body

146
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,000
attacking itself isn't it isn't a a

147
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,039
fact what's fact about it it's it's a

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,199
misguided theory that became law that

149
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,599
part is fact but it attacking the body

150
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,240
isn't fact and it messes people up

151
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,680
especially with pots that's why I have

152
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,919
to talk about it a little bit the

153
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
autoimmune

154
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:27,880
theory was being funded in the 1950s

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,479
this is when women were filing in like

156
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,520
an army like like file filing in like

157
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:39,560
soldiers that just came out of a war

158
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:43,160
zone a war zone they were just fatigued

159
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,080
sick couldn't function

160
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,000
migraines central nervous system

161
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,160
disorders brain fog confusion filing in

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,560
left and right into doctor's offices out

163
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,800
of nowhere out of nowhere ever before

164
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,199
like never before in history in fact

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,319
never before in history filing in

166
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,639
filing

167
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,840
in and they were filing into the

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,080
doctor's offices with complaints that

169
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,800
were all mystery and because these women

170
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,680
were mostly in their 40s and their 50s

171
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,319
and they were all on that edge of the

172
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,440
hormone change and everything doctors

173
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,319
said well Dr said first of all there was

174
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,039
never ever changes in people before this

175
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,199
in 1945 1950 before this women who went

176
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,720
through the change felt better they felt

177
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,039
better they had more libido they had

178
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,560
less headaches

179
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,360
they had less problems they had more

180
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,800
energy they could exercise more they

181
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,360
felt better they lost weight all these

182
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,440
different things happened like that were

183
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,840
all good then by 1945 it

184
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,639
changed because there was a something

185
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,440
was simultaneously happening during the

186
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,120
change it had nothing to do with the

187
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,240
change there was a virus that incubated

188
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,120
and had a shelf life of 40 years before

189
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:58,759
it came out and it was a virus the early

190
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:02,879
epan bars of 1900 1890 1892 1889 1901

191
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:06,440
1905 five that virus that exploded got

192
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:10,440
into people got into women very early

193
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,840
on and men but it got into women caused

194
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,479
the first

195
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,039
eruption of sickness that's never before

196
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,400
been seen first eruption of chronic

197
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,680
illness symptoms what did the medical

198
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,800
industry do they they try to sell it as

199
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,159
a hormone thing of course they did

200
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,360
because they were already developing

201
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:31,639
hormones perfect

202
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,560
timing sinister Sinister timing that's

203
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:38,800
right but you know what else developed

204
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,320
what else developed was yeah was a study

205
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,719
you know looking for things so there

206
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,959
were some good-hearted doctors and they

207
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,360
were looking for things they're looking

208
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,240
well they didn't think it was hormonal

209
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,600
so there was some good doctors that said

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,360
well you know we don't think this is

211
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,200
hormone related they couldn't find

212
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,240
anything they couldn't find a pathogen

213
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
cuz they didn't know where to look and

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,560
they didn't know how to look because

215
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,079
because they couldn't find a pathogen

216
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,560
they didn't understand pathogens they

217
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,480
still don't to this day why am I talking

218
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,920
about this because I'm talking about

219
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,279
pots pathogens pathogens yes we're going

220
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,800
to talk about pathogens related to

221
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,040
pots so these doctors were looking for

222
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,160
pathogens couldn't find any but what

223
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,600
they found was an

224
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,560
antibody which they claimed as an auto

225
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,440
antibod the body creating an auto

226
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,200
antibody to attack itself causing

227
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,560
symptoms in the

228
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,079
1950s it got funded and became law it

229
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,040
was a theory there was no evidence

230
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:42,200
whatsoever that an antibody or a auto

231
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,040
antibody attacks anything in fact they

232
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,880
couldn't even see that it wasn't even

233
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,560
humanly possible or

234
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,880
visible what a screw up of all time it

235
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,560
became law it was funded just like that

236
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,160
so back to the beginning of the show

237
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,000
it's like that thing I say at the very

238
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,079
beginning the information here is pure

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,160
it wasn't backed by trusted old

240
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,560
grandfathered medical funding laws with

241
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,440
strings attached in panels of

242
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,680
influencers and thing tanks it wasn't

243
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,040
it's not that information it's pure and

244
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,360
it's clean and that's why you're here

245
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,880
because you're going to learn about pots

246
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,440
today so what happened was the theory of

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,760
autoimmune was

248
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,880
birthed and it became law and no one

249
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,800
ever went against it no one ever went

250
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,240
against it that just assumed it was it

251
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,640
and then people who go to medical school

252
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,800
they just get taught whatever and they

253
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,880
out they go they just process them and

254
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,760
stamp them out out you go out you go

255
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,040
okay you just graduated okay you're good

256
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,639
do your internship okay out you go yep

257
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,079
that's the theories okay here's all the

258
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,920
bum theories here you go that's how it

259
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,000
was

260
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,480
done still

261
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,240
is right when it comes down to these but

262
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,920
there's good stuff they learn in medical

263
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,440
school but they you know where they

264
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,240
learn most of their stuff they learn it

265
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,560
in practice when they wake up and they

266
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,480
go to their first practice day and

267
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,320
they're like who why is it so different

268
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,720
what are all these problems people have

269
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,880
they didn't even talk about this in

270
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,680
medical school wait a minute what what's

271
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,800
going on and they got to learn you got

272
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,079
to go in the trenches and you got to

273
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,360
learn and the best medical doctors in

274
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,920
the world do that and then they and then

275
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,440
decide they want to get interested in

276
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,200
something and they go into a specialized

277
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,160
field and they dive in and they can't

278
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,079
get funding because the funding is

279
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,639
corrupted because no one wants to know

280
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,240
about what's really causing pots no one

281
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,680
wants to know what's really causing pot

282
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,519
so these doctors can't get these

283
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,000
immunologists can't get funding but if

284
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
they want to play around with genes and

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,160
autoimmune theories they could get all

286
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,760
the funding they want because that's the

287
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,279
belief in the law if they want to play

288
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,839
around with jeans you know why doctors

289
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,920
are going into jeans so much it's the

290
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,399
only thing they can get funded for how

291
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,800
about that how about them apples how

292
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,959
about them

293
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,079
apples yeah it's important to

294
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,320
know someone said to me the other day

295
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,800
you've been doing a lot of ranting and

296
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
raving about stuff I said yeah it's

297
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,760
critical for people to know because

298
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,720
you're going to blame theirselves they

299
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,000
going to blame their health they're

300
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,680
going to blame their bodies breaking

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,360
down they're going to blame it on Old

302
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,560
theories and they're going to get hurt

303
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,040
and this person said you know what I

304
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,200
didn't think about it that way I go

305
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,000
that's because you're not suffering with

306
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,920
pots you're not suffering with something

307
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,800
that's why you're feeling fine you go to

308
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,320
the golf course you play golf you feel

309
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,320
fine okay you got a little high blood

310
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,320
pressure you got a little bit of

311
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,519
cholesterol doctors don't know why I

312
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,040
know why it's because your a liver

313
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,440
problem that they can't

314
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,120
find but you got nothing going on so you

315
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,480
just go play golf and you're okay but so

316
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,720
you don't you don't really like my

317
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,760
ranting and

318
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,000
raving cuz you know you're not in a bed

319
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,040
and then when you get up from your bed

320
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,880
you almost fall over and pass out and

321
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,560
you get dizzy in Vertigo and you can't

322
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,760
exercise and you can't go and live the

323
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,240
life that you want to live right now

324
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,079
and you okay that's not your life so you

325
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,240
don't have pots you're not dealing with

326
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,920
something you go out in the golf course

327
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,480
you go drive your car around all day

328
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,120
long you feel

329
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,600
fine yeah yeah you take your high blood

330
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,480
pressure medicine medicine because you

331
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
don't want to quit eating all the wrong

332
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,360
foods and you don't want to quit you

333
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,600
know putting too much fat inside your

334
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,160
liver causing High you know high fat fat

335
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,959
liver that's developing a pre pre pre-

336
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,839
fatty liver doctors can't find yet and

337
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,160
that's what's causing your high

338
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,480
cholesterol and high blood pressure you

339
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,920
don't want to eat better but you know

340
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,600
you're doing great so you don't want to

341
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,440
hear my ranting and

342
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,440
raving but my ranting and raving what it

343
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,880
is what it is it's things that you have

344
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,720
to understand you need to know a little

345
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,360
history so you don't just you don't

346
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,760
destroy yourself with the bad Theory and

347
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,120
not heal one of the ways you heal from

348
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,760
pots just like you heal from other

349
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,839
misguided labeled

350
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,680
illnesses one of the ways you heal is

351
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,040
knowing what's wrong obviously and

352
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,279
what's causing it the other thing is

353
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,160
what to do for

354
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:53,440
it but also shed away and dispel the

355
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,759
bull the lies the theories that were

356
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,199
grandfathered in that get in your way

357
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,800
and that's the other piece of it darn

358
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,519
right that's the other piece of it I'm

359
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,160
talking about you better believe

360
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,600
it

361
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,480
and and this is critical to know so here

362
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,519
we are we're going to get down to the

363
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,199
bottom what causes dis

364
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,320
atomia disauto atomia

365
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,839
sorry we're going to get down to the

366
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,240
bottom of a postural orthostatic tacac

367
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,959
cardia syndrome we going to get to the

368
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,839
bottom of that dis autonomia comes in

369
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:32,000
different shapes and sizes it comes in

370
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,240
different shapes and sizes different

371
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,040
different levels of disautonomia

372
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,759
different L levels of it different um

373
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,160
different you extreme to mild the whole

374
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,519
B you might be suffering with it and

375
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,440
you're listening to the

376
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,920
show you might be

377
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,639
suffering and and and struggling with it

378
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,959
it's a struggle for a lot of people it's

379
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,360
really difficult I mean you know you

380
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,279
know and if you you might have a loved

381
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,680
one with it you got to take care of your

382
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:02,040
daughter with

383
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,680
it and it hits a lot of young women why

384
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:08,839
why does it hit a lot of young

385
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:11,720
women why it does hits men too but hits

386
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:14,040
a lot of young women there's a reason

387
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,959
for that there's a reason for that there

388
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,639
a lot of Epstein bars I said it Epstein

389
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,880
bars that get into women really young

390
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,360
when they're young causing early monos

391
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,519
that sometimes aren't even detected

392
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,560
mostly aren't even detected they go to

393
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,199
another phase in another stage and they

394
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,680
end up getting the nervous

395
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,800
system inflamed and it gets diagnosed as

396
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,600
pots they get all the symptoms

397
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,000
pots except Steen bar the one thing I

398
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,440
have to Grant the one thing I have to

399
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,759
Grant the medical

400
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,000
industry with is they actually think

401
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,920
there's a correlation with a viral issue

402
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,920
they don't know what kind of virus they

403
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,399
don't have a clue they don't know what

404
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,839
they're talking about as far as what

405
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,279
looking for a virus they don't know any

406
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,720
of that but I have to give them credit

407
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:04,600
we're credit is due they affiliated

408
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,560
gilon Beret sometimes

409
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,199
lupus and a viral

410
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:14,680
condition into it a little bit the big

411
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:18,759
mistake is it's not the viral

412
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,040
issue they hang their hat on they hang

413
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,480
their hat on the body attacking itself

414
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,000
they're big nasty mistake negligent

415
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,279
Mistake by accident through default of

416
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,880
being taught this by the system by the

417
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,600
industry their their mistake is the

418
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,000
great mistake of autoimmune in the body

419
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,720
attacking itself pots is not the body

420
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,920
attacking itself but they do have one

421
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,000
thing they caught on to is

422
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,399
viral there is a viral correlation they

423
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,120
don't know how what why and I got to

424
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:56,319
give them respect and I got to give

425
00:16:52,120 --> 00:17:00,279
them thankfulness and honor and and and

426
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,800
glory to that glory be because they

427
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,360
they're figuring that

428
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,000
out but here's what's happening you got

429
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,439
a virus that's causing the problem

430
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,240
that's attacking the body can I tell you

431
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,000
the difference between knowing your

432
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,679
body's not attacking itself versus a

433
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,600
virus is let me tell you the

434
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:23,959
difference you got control back because

435
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:27,839
we can stomp on a virus we can kick the

436
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:33,440
crap out of a virus over time we can

437
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:37,760
beat a virus down over time we can beat

438
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:40,799
it we can beat it we can do things like

439
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,880
take lemon bomb which is

440
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,440
Melissa and Melissa doesn't take any

441
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:51,720
crap at

442
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:54,360
all Melissa can kick the life out of a

443
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,159
virus because she doesn't take it she

444
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,400
does take any crap doesn't take any heat

445
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,360
from anybody you can't mess with her

446
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,159
that's one powerful herb one powerful

447
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,039
herb right there you take lemon bomb

448
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,640
long enough and you just slowly squash

449
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:13,440
and beat down that bully and beat down

450
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,559
that bully and beat it down until it's

451
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,200
down to the ground because when you know

452
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,360
you got a bug causing the problem and

453
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,760
you know your body is protecting you and

454
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,200
not hurting you you start turning around

455
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,280
your pots over time darn right that's

456
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,960
the power of it I had somebody say to me

457
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,600
I had a practitioner say

458
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,840
practitioners said to me a while back I

459
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,799
remember it I'll never forget it they

460
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,240
said okay so you're saying you're saying

461
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,360
Anthony that it's not the body attacking

462
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,280
itself you're saying it's a virus

463
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,240
attacking the body wasn't that going to

464
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,630
scare the

465
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,200
person I

466
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:51,000
[Laughter]

467
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:55,000
said I said I'm going to tell you right

468
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,480
now let's pretend you're the patient and

469
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and this practitioner doctor said okay

470
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,159
I'll pretend I'm the patient I said come

471
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,240
on serious seriously put your hat on put

472
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:06,120
your thinking cap on become that patient

473
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,480
become that patient that you see and he

474
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,280
said all right all right I'm doing it

475
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm doing it I'm the patient I got these

476
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:16,559
symptoms I said let's do more than that

477
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,200
you got these symptoms which you can't

478
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,120
feel because you don't really have them

479
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,799
I said to the doctor I said but you got

480
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,360
these symptoms but you got other things

481
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,720
going on you can't work anymore so you

482
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,880
got to give up your practice he goes oh

483
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,679
that's that that sucks that's what he

484
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,679
said to me he said that word so I'm not

485
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,760
trying to say nasty words he just said

486
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,799
that word and I said yeah you lost your

487
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,640
practice cuz you can't work anymore and

488
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,360
he said all right okay okay that that

goes yeah yeah that hurts I gu okay and

493
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,760
then then people they kind of think

494
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,280
you're a hypercondriac too so you got to

495
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,120
you got to f file for disability and you

496
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,280
got people that think you're

497
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,960
hypercondriac you got to lean on other

498
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,520
family members for help and financial

00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:02,080
attacking

549
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,960
itself I go how does that feel he goes

550
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,640
you know what he said it it doesn't feel

551
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,320
good I get it I know what you're trying

552
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,320
to do I said all right Jack Jack Jack

553
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,440
Jack listen your body's not attacking

554
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,240
itself I need to tell you the truth he

555
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,279
goes all right what's the truth I go you

556
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,120
have a virus that's been in your system

557
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:23,320
a long time and that's what's causing

558
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,360
problems and inflaming and attacking the

559
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,919
body he goes all right he goes is there

560
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,240
anything we can do go of course there is

561
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,720
why don't we go after the virus he goes

562
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,600
you know I got some good ideas to go

563
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,480
after a virus too I am a doctor I'm not

564
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,320
100% alternative but I'm partly

565
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,559
alternative and I'm mostly you know an

566
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,279
MD regular conventional because but I

567
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,799
got some ideas I go yeah we're going to

568
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,000
go after the virus he goes that sounds

569
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,559
amazing he goes his life changed his

570
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,640
life changed he wasn't sick we were just

571
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,640
we were playing the

572
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,400
roles he his life changed from that then

573
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,279
he went back and he started looking up

574
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,159
the law of the autoimmune law and then

575
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:05,200
he was on the computer and then he was

576
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,559
sending me all this stuff and all these

577
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
old documents of how it was just a

578
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,880
theory and how they don't even know what

579
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,799
that auto antibod is doing and

580
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,919
antibodies doing they have no clue and

581
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,520
he's sending me all this data on how it

582
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,520
falls through your hands like

583
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,159
sand excuse

584
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:29,480
me I just drank a whole thing of celery

585
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:32,760
juice and you know he was liter Al like

586
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,720
it fell through his fingers like

587
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,360
sand and he couldn't believe

588
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,080
it he couldn't believe it it was just an

589
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:44,400
old grandfathered funded idea that was a

590
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,000
concept that's poisonous and from there

591
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,279
on out

592
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,200
everybody he doesn't say the body's

593
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:54,440
attacking

594
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,840
itself never he never ever tells his

595
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,600
patients they file in he never tells

596
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:02,039
them their body's attacked backing

597
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,200
itself ever

598
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:08,240
again that's right that's

599
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,240
right instead he goes after

600
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,320
pathogens he goes after pathogens and he

601
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,120
doesn't mess around and one of his best

602
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,720
friends now is Melissa the girl that

603
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,080
really doesn't take any crap and she

604
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,760
knows how to kickbox big time and she

605
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,159
kicks kickbox

606
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,039
is Epstein bar right down to the ground

607
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
and that's what lemon balm does that's

608
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:33,919
what Melissa does and you

609
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,960
know and that's just one thing that's

610
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,760
just one thing we can do the point is is

611
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,120
it matters so let's talk about pots

612
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,559
let's talk about the whole thing this

613
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,559
autot Tomia is um is is another theory

614
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,480
circulation to the nerve

615
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:55,720
circulation um slow vein draw going up

616
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,760
the body um you get up too fast your

617
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,880
heart

618
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,000
races but what's really happening what's

619
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,600
really happening it's a viral condition

620
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,840
100% it's a viral condition that sits

621
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,159
inside the liver it's a viral condition

622
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,840
that's been sitting in the liver for a

623
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,279
long time producing producing a

624
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,200
tremendous amount of

625
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,679
neurotoxins

626
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,679
neurotoxins pots is a neurot sorry is a

627
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,679
neurotoxin

628

631
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,320
research with chronic illness is so far

632
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:35,480
behind it's it's it can make someone

633
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,440
depressed you know someone said to me do

634
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,840
you ever get depressed I said yeah I do

635
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,399
I do get depressed they're like what the

636
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,559
Anthony William gets depressed what are

637
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:45,000
you talking about yeah I get depressed

638
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,360
all the time they're like you need to do

639
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,480
something for that I go yeah I do and

640
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,720
they go what I go I talk about what gets

641
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,720
me

642
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,720
depressed in my books and in in in the

643
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,080
radio shows I said what are you talking

644
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,679
about I said yeah it's a fact that

645
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,200
medical science medical research is so

646
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,159
far behind on chronic illness it's the

647
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,159
most depressing thing I've ever

648
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,520
seen it's set it saddens me deep in the

649
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:13,799
heart deep in the soul every single

650
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,600
day and it's it's it's it's a it's it's

651
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,720
that part I have to bear of it of

652
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,360
knowing how behind it is it's so behind

653
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,760
it's maddening it's so Antiquity it's

654
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,360
maddening it's so Antiquity it's so

655
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,200
antique that just the newest experts

656
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,840
today putting out books meaning whether

657
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,320
it's on thyroid or anything else it's

658
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,559
it's it's so sad to even see it and

659
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,120
that's the newest in what year are we in

660
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,679
where still the body attacking itself

661
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,159
stuff it's still misinformation it's

662
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,679
still theories it's still it's

663
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,720
unbelievable everything and that that I

664
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:48,159
mean and anything in any Arena and you

665
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,880
know natural medicine is great it's just

666
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,600
chronic illness it's still behind it's

667
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,320
depressing

668
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,880
suppressing

669
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,840
so with when it comes down to pots what

670
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,320
it is it's a neurotoxic disorder it's

671
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,000
100% neurotoxic related neurotoxins

672
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,840
caused by the Epstein bar the Epstein

673
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,480
bar one of the varieties that causes

674
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,039
pots one of the varieties out of the 60

675
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,120
plus v varieties that causes pots that

676
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:21,360
is the cause it's Epstein bar and

677
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,399
Epstein bar sits in the liver produces a

678
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,640
tremendous amount of neurotoxin that

679
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,960
neurotoxin floats around it swells up

680
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,720
the nerves so you can't exercise it

681
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,279
swells up the nerves so you get the

682
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,240
brain fog it swells up the nerves so you

683
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:40,240
can't focus it swells up the nerves so

684
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,799
the heart Works harder the liver pushes

685
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,519
the blood out of the out through the

686
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,039
liver up to the heart making it as clean

687
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,240
as it can but when there's too many

688
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,559
neurotoxins flooding the flooding the

689
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,519
bloodstream the neurotoxins go into the

690
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:58,320
heart and they Tire the

691
00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:02,600
heart they Tire the heart heart

692
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,679
palpitations are part of this a Gunk

693
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,440
collects a debris collects in the mitro

694
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,679
valve and other valves creating

695
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,320
different varieties of eutopic heartbeat

696
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:16,720
ectopic heartbeat and Pals heart palps

697
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,080
it's an Epstein bar related

698
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,720
symptom the one thing I love though one

699
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,039
thing that gives me hope is they at

700
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,080
least realize that gilon Beret could

701
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,360
have something even to do with pots

702
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:32,480
thank the Lord because

703
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:35,320
and uh I say that because gilon ber is

704
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,399
an Epstein bar illness gilon Bret is

705
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:41,240
Epstein bar it's an Epstein bar illness

706
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,240
so someday and my hopes and dreams and

707
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,840
in my heart they're just going to

708
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,279
override the

709
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,440
stupidity and it's going to come

710
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,440
together and we're going to know finally

711
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,640
what's wrong with people so we can help

712
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,840
more people than I can help every day

713
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,559
I'm just one guy what if everybody knew

714
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,200
the truth

715
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,960
things that change and maybe we could

716
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,360
beat out the funding machine and all the

717
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,120
nasty stuff behind it all we can beat

718
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,840
out that bureaucracy that's involved in

719
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,760
the medical worlds both alternative and

720
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,279
conventional that just you know and the

721
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,960
reason why they want us and you know

722
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,760
what they'll just throw pots right into

723
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,960
genetics big time if your Epstein bar

724
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,200
came from your parents or if you're

725
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,799
sensitive to Epstein bars because you

726
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,120
happen to have a lot of mercury in your

727
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,799
system and then your daughter you know

728
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,600
has the Epstein bar and and she has the

729
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:33,640
Mercury and she develops a symptom

730
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,200
similar to poan St

731
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,519
genetic that's an evil evil machine I

732
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,360
talk about that more and more each day

733
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,919
more and more each day the problem is

734
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,480
here's what's hard when you put out the

735
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:49,519
truth and people already invest their

736
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,600
lives into the nontruth they're going to

737
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,480
fight for it they're going to fight for

738
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,360
it tooth and nail they're going to fight

739
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,840
for it man because they just put their

740
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,559
work into it so when this guy

741
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,600
put his work in the funding and all the

742
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,080
funding goes into some autoimmune theory

743
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,039
that that like I said this Dr Guy know

744
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,720
that Jack said that that's even a theory

745
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:10,519
that they they never even proved the

746
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,480
auto antibody the auto

747
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:16,320
antibody is an antibod actually produced

748
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,440
by the immune system to only go after

749
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,000
one thing the virus never the body the

750
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,799
virus so go it's geared only go after

751
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,640
the Epstein bar and only the Epstein bar

752
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,799
but it needs help it needs more than

753
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,760
just that we we need the herbs we need

754
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,440
the nutrients we need the foods to go

755
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,320
after the Epstein bar to we need to do a

756
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,840
whole campaign against it so back to

757
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,120
what I was saying when you invest into a

758
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,960
nontruth like autoimmune or you write

759
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,080
books about genes because you're

760
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,080
invested and you're you're interested in

761
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,120
these these topics so you write a whole

762
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,080
book on it and you invest your life into

763
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,880
it it's you can't just turn that off and

764
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,279
go with the truth you can't just say oh

765
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,279
okay wait a minute all right all right

766
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,440
you know I can't you can't put on the

767
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,919
brakes that's one of the problems so

768
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,120
when nontruth is out there to such a

769
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,679
saturation and everybody's got all their

770
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,679
money invested in their time their books

771
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,600
you name it about autoimmune books left

772
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,480
and right and it's all wrong information

773
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,559
it's all autoimmune books by the piles

774
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,840
out there just buy the truckloads and

775
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,519
they invest in that you think they're

776
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,440
going to just shut that

777
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,120
down and and and and admit that they

778
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,159
made a mistake even if they learn the

779
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,880
truth no and this is why nothing gets

780
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,080
done and we just can't get there but you

781
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,279
know the truth and we're going to work

782
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,399
on that we're going to work with that so

783
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,840
here's the

784
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:37,559
deal the deal is with pots it's about

785
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,399
going after the Epstein bar virus you

786
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,880
can recover I've recovered lots of

787
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:43,039
people and what I mean lots of people

788
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,159
over the decades hundreds of people with

789
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,840
pots recovered them so they actually had

790
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:48,440
their life back so they can get out of

791
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,840
bed and say oh my God I'm actually going

792
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,039
to walk five miles can you believe that

793
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,039
I'm going to go walk 5 miles and I I'm

794
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,440
going to feed myself in between it all

795
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,960
and I'm going to be able to do what I

796
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,840
need to do I'm going to go take a shower

797
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:04,480
people with pots can't shower it means

798
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,960
it's they just they they lost a day they

799
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,279
lost a day in their life cuz they

800
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,799
showered that means they're dizzy

801
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:16,000
they're worn out that means they're back

802
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:20,279
in bed because of a

803
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,159
shower they lost a day can you imagine

804
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:24,639
right I'm sure some some of you probably

805
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,600
do imagine because you're going through

806
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:28,600
it you lose a day and the reason why is

807
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,880
cuz when that water hits your head and

808
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,720
nobody knows this this is another this

809
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,960
is another truth that just doesn't exist

810
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,440
out there I mean nobody knows it

811
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,760
nobody's nobody knows that Spirit knows

812
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,639
and here's what happens when the water

813
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,480
hits the head all the nerve endings all

814
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:45,159
the nerves that go up around the skull

815
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,799
on the outside of the brain they all hit

816
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:49,000
the inside of the skull there all these

817
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,320
different nerve endings those nerve

818
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,480
endings are filled with neurotoxins from

819
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,679
the have being so viral so long having

820
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,559
the epine bar in your system so long and

821
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,559
those neurotoxins

822
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,120
those

823
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,679
neurotoxins they inflame those nerves

824
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,159
those nerves become inflamed from the

825
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,840
virus from the viral nerv neurotoxins

826
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,600
it's not the body attacking itself so

827
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,639
when you have water hitting your head

828
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,960
and it's hitting it's hitting those

829
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:18,480
nerves and the vertigo could come the

830
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,279
dizziness the imbalance you get out of

831
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,559
the shower you're like oh my God let me

832
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:24,639
just get to my my couch or my bed that

833
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,559
was it for the day you're lucky two

834
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:28,279
hours later you can get you're so weak

835
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,159
you can get up that's that's that's a

836
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:33,000
version of

837
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,159
pots the reason why the heartbeat raises

838
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,760
when you get off the ground or you get

839
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,399
off the bed and your heart jumps up 30

840
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,240
beats per minute just from standing up

841
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:43,120
or 40 beats first of all the heart jumps

842
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,600
up for everybody no matter who it is if

843
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,880
you are laying down and you get up your

844
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,000
heart's going to jump up a little bit

845
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,639
anyway but for people with pots it jumps

846
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,880
up a lot higher the reason why is the

847
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:56,240
heart's working harder because the

848
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,159
amount of saturation of poison in the

849
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,320
liver going into into the bloodstream

850
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,720
going into the nerves the nerves being

851
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,600
inflamed and nerves being inflamed and

852
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,440
the neurotoxins inflaming everything it

853
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,919
it makes it hard the heart heart has to

854
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,440
work harder and then you take pots

855
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:19,520
somebody with pots and you put them on

856
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:21,720
an asinine trendy dumb diet I know I say

857
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,000
you know probably not the best thing

858
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,879
sometimes yeah I told Spirit when I was

859
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,320
young that I can't

860
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:30,280
change I'm going to say stupid things

861
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,480
once in a while spirit said that's okay

862
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,280
as long as you got the information right

863
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,839
spirit said that's all right I said I'm

864
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,879
also going to you know be

865
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,960
sarcastic and spirit said that's okay if

866
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:41,520
that's what you have to do Anthony to

867
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,040
deal with this and survive this gift

868
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,119
that's what you have to do this gift for

869
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,000
the people to survive this information

870
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,359
that's coming through I said yeah I'm

871
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
going to be sarcastic and I'm not going

872
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:52,320
to be always you know I don't know my

873
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,639
words aren't going to be always so

874
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,359
perfect I'm not a scholar I didn't go to

875
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,599
Harvard and

876
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:01,040
but what happens is when you put

877
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,760
somebody with

878
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,119
pots on a diet that's

879
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,119
trending that's trying to fix everything

880
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,440
out there it's not a good thing if you

881
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:16,160
what I'm talking about a diet that's

882
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,960
trending a low carb diet a low carb diet

883
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,680
now with pots you don't want to use a

884
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,440
carb that could feed a virus so you

885
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,920
don't want to use chocolate cake to feed

886
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,520
a virus you know lard inside the cake

887
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,800
you got lard in there you got wheat

888
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,480
gluten you got preservatives you got

889
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,800
something in the fondant on the top of

890
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,280
the cake fondant made out of

891
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,320
preservatives dyes and

892
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,640
chemicals natural flavorings unnatural

893
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,079
flavorings preservatives you name it got

894
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,520
fondant on there you know I I was

895
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,720
actually over a family member's house

896
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,359
and they had one of those shows on one

897
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,119
of those cake making shows so I think

898
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,680
there's a couple of them out there they

899
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,960
had one of these cake making shows on

900
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,920
there and I was watching it they were

901
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,480
you know they're playing around with

902
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,640
tons and tons of fondant you know and

903
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,560
they're doing I don't even know if

904
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,680
that's what you call it and they're just

905
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,520
you know they're just doing all this

906
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,000
kind of stuff in it and and and and I

907
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,720
said to Spirit I said hey here's your

908
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,400
favorite spirit says I hate when you

909
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,200
watch these shows and I said and spirit

910
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,440
do say hate spirit says a different word

911
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,040
and that I'm just voicing out what what

912
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,119
the word equates

913
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:24,440
to and spirit said yeah and and you know

914
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,800
because of what's in those fondant

915
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,560
what's in the and then what's in the

916
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,160
cake because can feed it can feed a

917
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,720
virus like Epstein bar nobody knows that

918
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,119
nobody even to this day nobody knows

919
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,240
viruses eat anything it's only coming

920
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,760
from Spirit and if you hear it out there

921
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,240
it came from me one way or another and

922
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,359
you know and the thing it's always

923
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,079
important to know that so you don't get

924
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,440
sidetracked onto a whole different place

925
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,160
of of information that's also got

926
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,560
misinformation just riddled in it and

927
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,839
anyway the chocolate cake is a carb bad

928
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,839
carb it's got bad fat in there also bad

929
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,560
carbohydrates in there there but these

930
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,160
low carb diets are a nightmare for

931
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,720
somebody with pots because people with

932
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,160
pots their adrenals are tired their

933
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,720
nervous system is is in desperate need

934
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,560
of glucose which is sugar which is

935
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,520
carbs their liver can't handle fats

936
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,040
their liver can't handle fats I'm

937
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,920
telling you right now

938
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,880
secrets and and you put them on a high

939
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,200
fat diet and take away all their carbs

940
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,160
it's like if it's bad for somebody with

941
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,920
pots of course the good part about that

942
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,560
diet is you're taking away the bad

943
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,240
processed foods the fried foods you're

944
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,960
taking away cheap sugar you're taking

945
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,760
away stuff like that which does matter

946
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,880
for somebody with pots but you also

947
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,000
leave them without what they do need to

948
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,280
heal even if they experience better

949
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,560
symptoms at first in order to heal

950
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,200
completely they're going to have to have

951
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,280
a carb this is one of the great mistakes

952
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,839
of alternative medicine right now is the

953
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,040
low carb Trend train which is absolutely

954
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:04,760
Ely ridiculously

955
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,000
wrong so it's important to know this

956
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,280
that means fruit is an answer to someone

957
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,040
recovering with pots fruit is antiviral

958
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,280
antibacterial yes it is whether anybody

959
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,000
likes it or not it is and I'm going to

960
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,839
tell you now not just fruit but you got

961
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,680
the leafy greens but that's not a carb I

962
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:22,839
get that but the starchy vegetables are

963
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,599
okay too a little bit of potato that's

964
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:28,839
right sweet potatoes that's right um

965
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,920
sweet potatoes winter squash once again

966
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:33,560
that's right and these are really

967
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,680
important for that and you got to keep

968
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,359
the animal protein down somebody with

969
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,079
pots you got to minimize it it's even

970
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:41,680
good even to go off it completely with

971
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,760
somebody with pots but you got to

972
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,839
minimize it you do if you really like it

973
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,800
you still got to minimize it you got to

974
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,000
make because you got to make room for

975
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,839
these other foods that are antiviral not

976
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,160
because I don't like animal protein for

977
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,520
somebody it's because you want to get

978
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,599
rid of these foods that are antiviral

979
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,720
and you never want to eat eggs with pots

980
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,640
and you never want to eat bacon with

981
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,880
pots you never want to eat dairy

982
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,839
products with pots these feed viruses

983
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,720
the bacon is so high in fat that it'll

984
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:14,200
just wreak havoc but the the eggs the

985
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,800
dairy products will feed Epstein bar the

986
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,400
virus that causes

987
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,720
pots it's not just that it's the weak

988
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:27,280
gluten feeds epin bar it's too much corn

989
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:31,920
feeds Epstein bar which is bad with p

990
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,480
thoughts or any kind of disautonomia any

991
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,800
kind of

992
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,760
disautonomia

993
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,720
seriously and that's important to know

994
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,359
so we got to be careful we got to be

995
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,520
careful with the

996
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:46,720
foods one of the greatest things for

997
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,359
pots ever is celery juice now it's not a

998
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,920
calorie so if you drink a celery and

999
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:51,839
don't have any calories man you're going

1000
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,839
to hit the wall but when you drink

1001
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,640
celery the mineral salts count for

1002
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,880
repairing the central nervous system in

1003
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,079
the brain for somebody with pots I got

1004
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,280
to finish my celery juice right here and

1005
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,040
I got it in my

1006
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,880
hand and um I've been bringing my celery

1007
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,520
juice to the show a lot more a lot more

1008
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,839
meaning in my hand like a fresh glass of

1009
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,560
it I drink it in the morning I don't do

1010
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:17,240
the show in the morning I do the show

1011
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:22,640
obviously my time you know my time in

1012
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:25,000
the uh afternoon over here in the US and

1013
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,240
you know and and but I'm asking my

1014
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:32,280
assistant can I have some juice now for

1015
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,079
the show and um because it reminds me of

1016
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,040
how powerful it is too you know what it

1017
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,760
does the mineral salts subgroups of

1018
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,800
mineral salts undiscovered by research

1019
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,040
and science because instead of putting

1020
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,680
instead of putting $500 million in

1021
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,200
figuring out what's why celery is a

1022
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,800
miracle cure you take $500 million and

1023
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,079
stick it into genes once more so you can

1024
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:54,000
insult people in their hereditary

1025
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:57,280
traits it's amazing it's amazing

1026
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,839
sick but you know the celery reboots the

1027
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,520
central nervous system but it's not

1028
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:04,000
enough you need to have a sugar you need

1029
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,359
to have glucose see the nervous system

1030
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,200
demands glucose which is guess what a

1031
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:12,119
carbohydrate that's right that's right

1032
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,160
that's right for those high-fat trending

1033
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,319
you know people out there high fat high

1034
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,400
fat high fat I get it I get it listen I

1035
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,000
get it if someone who eats a regular

1036
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
standard American diet filled with all

1037
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,079
kinds of garbage pizza and everything

1038
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,599
else they want to lose weight they want

1039
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,319
to start getting in shape they don't

1040
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,960
really have any illnesses that are ser

1041
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,240
ious or or confining them so they go to

1042
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,040
they go to a a grand scheme of a high

1043
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,760
fat trending diet they get rid of their

1044
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,359
processed food they hop on the treadmill

1045
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,920
and they start working out every day

1046
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:40,119
they think they found the holy Grill I

1047
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,440
get it and I'm happy for them because I

1048
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,119
want them to quit the processed food in

1049
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,560
the garbage but if they developed a

1050
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,920
health problem or had a real health

1051
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,240
problem behind it all that's not going

1052
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,480
to be the answer in the end they got to

1053
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,960
lower the animal fat lower the high

1054
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,680
protein down the fat down in the diet

1055
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,240
and raise the fruits and vegetables on

1056
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,480
the other end of it and that's what

1057
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,680
what's happening you'll see some of the

1058
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,400
trending higher fat diets being more

1059
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,599
vegetables and they allow you more

1060
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,319
berries and more green apples because

1061
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:07,640
they're starting to realize that people

1062
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,960
are getting a little better the more of

1063
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,000
that you add in and then when you add in

1064
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,560
most of it and you're getting majority

1065
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,960
of it all the fruits and the vegetables

1066
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,000
and the green juices and lots lots of

1067
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,920
those carbs that everybody's afraid of

1068
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,920
you heal from neurological

1069
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,359
disautonomia conditions like pots and so

1070
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,559
forth and celery juice combined with the

1071
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:30,960
fruit like banana can actually heal

1072
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,880
somebody with pots banana kills Epstein

1073
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,160
bar and it restores the nervous system

1074
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,359
with somebody with pots so then you can

1075
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,240
actually heal

1076
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:44,400
them but Banana's taken away all the

1077
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,559
trending diets take it away out of

1078
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,240
ignorance out of ignorance due to a

1079
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:52,559
mistake that was made about 10 or 11

1080
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,119
years ago from a popular popular

1081
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,280
practitioner Doctor Who wanted to sell

1082
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,920
his fruit in a pill so told everybody to

1083
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,240
stay away from the fruit itself that

1084
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,880
it's cancer

1085
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,880
causing and it got through the it got

1086
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:10,240
through the web it got through the

1087
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:13,000
system but so I've recovered people with

1088
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,880
pots to a full capacity where they're

1089
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,880
exercising no symptoms whatsoever ever

1090
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,520
again by putting them on Epstein anti

1091
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,800
antivirals Epstein bar anti-in bar viral

1092
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,480
herbs supplements and foods and got them

1093
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,720
on the celery juices and banana

1094
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,800
smoothies every

1095
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,599
day and got them enough calories through

1096
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,079
that lowered their fats where they only

1097
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,480
had a few seeds or or a little bit of

1098
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,000
avocado here and there a little bit of

1099
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,680
coconut oil and have recovered them from

1100
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,920
pots completely so they can then do what

1101
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,359
they want down the road if they want to

1102
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,960
bring in more this if they want to bring

1103
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,640
in more salmon they can bring in more

1104
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,200
salmon they want to eat something else

1105
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,119
they can eat it and they get their life

1106
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,000
back they knock their Epstein bar all

1107
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:57,280
the way down to the ground and in book

1108
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,760
one I got the Epstein bar chapter in

1109
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,559
there about Epstein bar and the thyroid

1110
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,880
healing I really talk about Epstein bar

1111
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:08,160
like I've never done in the history of

1112
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,319
any I've ever

1113
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,960
done and

1114
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,480
um yeah so it's important to know that

1115
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,920
you got to yeah you keep the fats low

1116
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,280
you got to do the antivirals what do you

1117
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,920
need to do little bit of zinc pots is a

1118
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,440
tricky thing when someone gets so weak

1119
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,160
they can't handle taking anything or

1120
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,960
even eating things sometimes because it

1121
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,040
takes energy takes neurological energy

1122
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,400
to digest neurological energy to eat

1123
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,839
neurological energy to take any

1124
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,640
supplements I understand take a little

1125
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,240
bit by a little bit if you got a good

1126
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,040

after epine bar vitamin C if all else

1149
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,200
and you can't do anything and you got

1150
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,480
pots and you got a condition of some

1151
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,960
kind based around it if you can just do

1152
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,559
vitamin C and only vitamin C I'll be

1153
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,960
happy because vitamin C gets rid of the

1154
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,880
Epstein bar over time takes time if

1155
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,760
you've been in it too long it's okay

1156
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,640
you're going to get better we can get

1157
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,000

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,640
go crazy they get out of the bed they

1160
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,359
could barely get enough energy to get to

1161
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,839
theed bathroom and pee and then come

1162
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:03,520
back to

1163
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:05,800
bed and have recovered them Spirit

1164
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,520
recovered them with the

1165
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,680
information I can't give myself credit

1166
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,960
because it's it's it's Spirit bottom

1167
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,960
line I have to always remember that one

1168
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,640
time I uh claimed it was all me Spirit

1169
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,640
taught me a good lesson in the garden I

1170
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,480
told you that story it's in book one had

1171
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,119
the neighbor over neighbor was telling

1172
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,319
me how he doesn't understand how I knew

1173
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,880
what was wrong with the wife his wife

1174
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:28,280
how she couldn't walk for years and

1175
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,880
spirit said it was arsenic in their

1176
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,880
water and their well water and nobody

1177
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,960
knew

1178
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,960
and and and he tested and the well water

1179
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,599
had some arsenic in it and and then we

1180
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,440
did Heavy Metal detox to pull out the

1181
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:42,160
Arsenic and over time she walked for the

1182
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,319
first time in a long long long time and

1183
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,240
I was in the garden bragging he said how

1184
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,839
do you know these answers how is it

1185
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,319
possible how do you know you're not even

1186
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,280
a doctor I said I know everything

1187
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,680
there's nothing I don't know I know

1188
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,839
everything and never forget it never

1189
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:00,319
ever forget it I'll always be right I'm

1190
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,599
right everybody's wrong and never forget

1191
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,119
it I took two steps I stepped on a rake

1192
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:06,280
like a one of those ho rake things in

1193
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,880
the in the garden it flipped up backward

1194
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,400
smacked me in the face and it knocked me

1195
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,760
clean out I was out cold 100% knocked

1196
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,520
out I didn't even have time to see stars

1197
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,119
that's how fast I was knocked out as I

1198
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,920
was waking up my neighbor was standing

1199
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:23,720
over me he was just looking at me I had

1200
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,400
some onions still in my hand that was

1201
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:30,160
pulling out of the garden and Spirit

1202
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,400
then said remember this I'm always right

1203
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,200
you're always wrong I'm always right

1204
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,240
you're always wrong and spirit knows I'm

1205
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,559
not always wrong I got my own ideas and

1206
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,000
I got my own thoughts and I could be

1207
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:42,280
right about something but Spirit was

1208
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:46,280
making it clear when it comes down to

1209
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:49,520
this this part in my life spirit's

1210
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,839
always right and I was wrong and I T I

1211
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,640
would learned the lesson so I got to

1212
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,359
give Spirit credit cuz I don't want to

1213
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,800
step on another rake in the garden cuz I

1214
00:47:54,359 --> 00:48:00,079
do like the garden whenever I get it

1215
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,920
chance once in a blue moon um so listen

1216
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,440
you take it one day at a time with pots

1217
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,839
you have to have faith number one the

1218
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,480
faith and the hope and the faith and the

1219
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,400
hope and you also have to have the truth

1220
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,280
that your body's not attacking itself

1221
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,160
you got a bug in you it's been in there

1222
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,319
for a while big deal meaning your

1223
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:18,119
symptoms are a big deal I get it but the

1224
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:20,160
bug isn't you not we knock it down one

1225
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,760
thing I learned from Spirit right from

1226
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,640
the beginning and I'm going to tell you

1227
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,040
right now one thing I learned from

1228
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,680
Spirit right from the beginning is when

1229
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,599
you know what's wrong inside your body

1230
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,640
your body kicks it up a notch when you

1231
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:35,880
know it's a bug your immune system knows

1232
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,640
it's a bug as well it already knows it's

1233
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,680
a bug your immune system that's why it

1234
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,359
even creates an antibody to go after the

1235
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,400
bug not to go after you to harm you or

1236
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:45,119
to hurt you ever but it knows it's B but

1237
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,040
when it knows you know too and the two

1238
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,640
things combine the soul the heart of

1239
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,880
someone and the spirit of someone

1240
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,480
combines with the knowledge of knowing

1241
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,599
it's a virus you're going to squash and

1242
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,599
your body's squashing guess what happen

1243
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,839
guess what happens come on guess I know

1244
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,040
some of you are but not everybody is

1245
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:09,440
yeah you win the battle you destroy the

1246
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,839
virus you knock it down your immune

1247
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,920
system gets even stronger that's what

1248
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,920
happens all of that and the

1249
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:24,079
above and uh and never forget

1250
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,280
it never forget it so cucumber juice is

1251
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,000
great too you can do that look do teas

1252
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,079
herbal teas very helpful for for pots

1253
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,920
any kind of herbal tea you like you can

1254
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,200
do a little bit of golden seal for pots

1255
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:39,119
periodically I do like that that's not

1256
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:41,720
bad at all you can do that um and and

1257
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,640
and that's fine and but what I like what

1258
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,079
I like for pots is anything onion if you

1259
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:48,119
can handle any kind of onion any kind of

1260
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,880
like a chive or a little bit of a

1261
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:54,640
scallion very helpful for pots um eating

1262
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,880
every 45 minutes for pots is critical

1263
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,400
meaning s something eating something

1264
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,359
snacking on something every 45 minutes

1265
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,960
whether it's a banana and a celery stick

1266
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,599
whether it's a handful of nuts and seeds

1267
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,720
and a celery stick whether it's an apple

1268
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,040
apple and a handful of seeds whether

1269
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,400
it's Apple handful of hemp seeds whether

1270
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,280
it's an apple and a cucumber cucumber

1271
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,160
slices and apple whether it's you know

1272
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,640
juice if you can find some juice

1273
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,599
whatever it is eating every 45 minutes

1274
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:24,200
to an hour snacking and grazing is

1275
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:26,720
critical for pots critical sitting up

1276
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,760
when you can sit get up when you can

1277
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,240
walk when you can it's never going to be

1278
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:34,000
perfect at the beginning take walks one

1279
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,359
of the reasons it gets harder with pots

1280
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,160
is because it's like kind of it's very

1281
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:40,359
similar to other kinds of nervous system

1282
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,839
disorders because it's it's neurological

1283
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:45,000
to Epstein bar related what happens is

1284
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:46,880
you lose muscle and your body's not used

1285
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,079
to doing anything because you were

1286
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,680
inhibited prohibited from doing

1287
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:56,760
anything so excuse me so you were

1288
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:00,119
prohibited from doing it

1289
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,920
anything and what happened was you know

1290
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,240
it it doesn't help it kind of works

1291
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,359
against you and that's perfectly fine

1292
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,880
because if you do too much you're going

1293
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:08,000
to pay for it I get it you're not going

1294
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,440
to be able to do good function you're

1295
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,920
going to be wiped out taking a show

1296
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,040
wipes you out stand when you can when

1297
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,559
you can walk a little bit when you can

1298
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,599
each day it helps retrain the body while

1299
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:21,760
you're healing if you can't do it you do

1300
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,400
a little bit at a time I I knew somebody

1301
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,079
all they could do is just draw draw they

1302
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,400
could sit up for a half hour and draw

1303
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,799
and then they had to go back down

1304
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,559
absolutely but that sitting up and

1305
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:32,119
drawing for half an hour made a huge

1306
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,680
difference it was the beginning of their

1307
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:35,200
healing process and when you add

1308
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,440
everything else into it a little bit by

1309
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,680
little you heal and you move

1310
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,200
forward so yeah so that's where we are

1311
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,799
with pots we're coming to the end of the

1312
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,760
show check out the Instagram you know

1313
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:49,400
with everybody's stories check it out

1314
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,119
and uh Facebook I'm on there fooling

1315
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,160
around all the time on Instagram and I

1316
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:55,680
think somebody said somebody said on

1317
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,000
Facebook one day they said is this

1318
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:03,319

me with a heart you know oh oh here's

1320
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:06,760
what's really funny somebody said this

1321
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,400
can't be Anthony a guy said this can't

1322
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,160
be Anthony on Facebook because Anthony

1323
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,680
would never do hearts what are you

1324
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,520
kidding I love doing the hearts I love

1325
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:18,680
the hearts heart emojis I love those the

1326
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,200
red ones love those I love those and you

1327
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,280
know so on Facebook that's what I do I

1328
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,359
do the heart emojis I do the happy faces

1329
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,480
do other things too I'm on there I'm in

1330
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:28,200
there if you see I don't answer a really

1331
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,839
serious in depth question it's because I

1332
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,359
can't answer it because it would take I

1333
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,599
can't do a whole thesis some some people

1334
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:36,400
they ask me a question I'm like wow I

1335
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:38,520
know what the answer is to that question

1336
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,200
but it's going to take probably about 10

1337
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,119
minutes 15 minutes and it's going to

1338
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,319
probably take like a page two three

1339
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:47,440
pages of writing and um that's hard to

1340
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:49,040
do that's hard to do so just know that

1341
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,920
I'm there though and I try to answer

1342
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,240
questions that I can that seem to be

1343
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,920
brief enough um it's hard for me to do a

1344
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,240
a very very long you know a very long

1345
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,440
