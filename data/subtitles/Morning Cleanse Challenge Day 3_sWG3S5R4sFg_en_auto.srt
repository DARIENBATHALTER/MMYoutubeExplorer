get rid of toxins

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,439
you can't get rid of anything unless you

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,600
keep the fats out in the morning and

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,519
then when you bring in the powerful

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,039
healing tools

14
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,840
like the celery juice and the lemon

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,480
water then you're really getting the

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,439
stuff

17
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,880

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,280
anti-aging for

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,800
real not some bogus anti-aging

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,000
theoretical supplement from some scammer

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,239
and some you know whatever

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
infomercial out there mlm companies

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,920
saying here's an anti-aging

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,199
supplement and everybody's eating their

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,719
bacon in the morning

26
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,039
and taking their anti-aging supplement

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
it's not like that this is the real deal

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,280
that's what this stuff is

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
good to see you guys are live on tick

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
tock live on youtube live on facebook

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,879
lava clubhouse

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,720
excited that we're here i'm making the

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,200
potato skillet

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,439
because you can do a fat free potato

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,280
skillet it's like hash browns

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:19,360
with no insulin resistance going

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,840
on you guys gonna talk about salicylates

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,960
have you heard about salicylate some

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,439
people say

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,439
i'm really sick you know and it's

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,520
because it salicylates

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,560
salicylates in food so i'm trying to

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,640
stay away from

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,960
all these different foods because the

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,759
salicylates it's like that's how people

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,680
get

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,439
tricked out there by trends that

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
actually don't make any sense whatsoever

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,840
and don't exist

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
the reason why someone's got chronic

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,000
sinusitis

52
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,079
and they got phlegm in their lungs and

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
they don't feel good and there's there

54
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,759
they got utis and stomach problems and

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,439
digestive problems and bloat and all

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,560
this other stuff

57
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,320
is not because of salicylates not

58
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,479
because of oxalates not because of

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,759
lectins and that's the trick it's like

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,240
come out with the next bs thing so we

61
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,239
can infomercial the crap out of people

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,920
and mlm the crap out of people

63
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,440
and make sure they buy our lectin

64
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,480
supplements make sure they buy our

65
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,080
salicylates

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,160
salicylate supplements make sure they

67
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,000
buy oxalate supplements

68
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,360
make sure they buy all this garbage and

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
stay sick

70
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
it's the greatest scam and that's the

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,440
true snake oil

72
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,120
in the industry out there collagen

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,879
that's another snake oil in this

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,760
industry so there's tons of that real

for sure you know and that's what people

97
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,319
should be doing yeah they should be

98
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,599
doing a live rescue smoothie

99
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,920
they should be doing the heavy metal

100
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,000
detox smoothie but you know they're used

101
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,440
to eating eggs every morning you know

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
so it's like everybody's used to

103
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,480
cracking open those eggs it's like okay

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
you want them scrambled you want them

105
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,920
fried you want the poached eggs

106
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,799
wants a french toast right you want

107
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,000
uh you want an omelette right so

108
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,680
everybody wakes up in the morning it's

109
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,720
like you know what old habit let's get

110
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,560
the omelets going

111
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,560
let's crack you know what maybe i should

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,120
maybe i should crack an egg open and get

113
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,560
it in the pan but that's a comfort food

114
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,159
and it's comfort food that keeps us sick

115
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,519
we don't realize that when we stay sick

116
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,280
we stay sick with it so we're going to

117
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,040
do instead the potato skillet without

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,200
the insulin resistance

119
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,760

155
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,240

the morning cleanse has no fats in it

271
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,720
do you know how we get the diabetes we

272
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,279
get the type 2 diabetes because our

273
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,320
liver

274
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,680
gets blown out it gets weaker and weaker

275
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,959
and weaker and weaker

276
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,600
our liver gets blown out

277
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,880
it gets weaker and weaker and weaker

278
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,760
that's our liver right there

279
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,440
okay there it is that's our gallbladder

280
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,440
that's a liver

281
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,160
and we weaken our liver it gets

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,880
intoxicated it gets sludgy it gets

283
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,880
burdened by fats all that eggs that you

284
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,880
had all those years for breakfast

285
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
burdens it and burns it and then all the

286
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,480
fats you do every day because

287
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,080
everybody's on milk cheese eggs butter

288
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,560
bacon ham bologna

289
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,920
talked to a friend the other day and my

290
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
friend was like you know i've eaten so

291
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,600
much baloney over my lifetime

292
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,880
like i get it i mean people eat a lot of

293
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,079
baloney

294
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,160
they do right you know and so

295
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,480
but what it does to the liver is just

296
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,360
terrible it weakens it beats it down

297
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
slows it down makes it sluggish over

298
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,079
time

299
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,160
stagnant sluggish once it starts

300
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,720
happening the pancreas starts weakening

301
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,640
too

302
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
another thing too when you dump fats in

303
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,360
you all day long because that's what

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,880
everybody's doing they're dumping fats

305
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,320
in them all day long the pancreas

306
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,519
weakens

307
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,800
the pancreas weakens it does i just saw

308
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,480
on tic toc bologna

309
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,920
right and when the pancreas weakens it's

310
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,839
another reason why we're getting the

311
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,519
boobs getting set up for type 2.

312
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
so type 2 works in this way your liver

313
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,279
starts getting beaten down

314
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,399
your liver can't produce the bile it

315
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,760
needs so your bile can't break down the

316
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,279
fats as much

317
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,200
more fats are in your bloodstream

318
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,040
because your your liver is weakening

319
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
because of the fats and more fats are in

320
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,880
your bloodstream now and guess what

321
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,600
guess what happens you guys your

322
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,000
pancreas has to release more insulin

323
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
because there's more fat in your

324
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,360
bloodstream

325
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,880
so your pancreas has to release more

326
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,839
insulin more insulin

327
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,600
eventually your credit card gets used

328
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,720
up your pancreas and i've been saying

329
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,160

330
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,600
early radio shows and even before that

331
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,160
early lectures

332
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,079
the pancreas is your credit card that's

333
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,519
your credit card you can use that baby

334
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,560

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,720
eat them you know eat them until we can

375
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,519
find another option until we get more

376
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,079
foods to you

377
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,560
like i get it life's not easy but if you

378
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,639
have the ability to switch things up

379
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,240
and switch things up let's work on doing

380
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,240
it i know it's hard either way we get

381
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,040
into habits we get into patterns we get

382
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,480
into comfort foods we get into emotional

383
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,519
emotional patterns is where we get into

384
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
two

385
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,920
but it gives you a chance to kind of you

386
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,600
know lower the grass-fed beef or

387
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,920
lower the beef whatever kind of beef

388
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,600
you're eating you know lower the eggs or

389
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,000
hopefully get rid of the eggs lower the

390
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,079
chicken right that's one thing there too

391
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,839
and it helps and the same thing with

392
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,360
butter right

393
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,680
you're not gonna see me put butter in

394
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,120
this pan i'm gonna cook right now

395
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,880
you're not going to see me put butter in

396
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,320
the pan just letting you know

397
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,560
you're not i'm not going to put butter

398
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,959
in the pan

399
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,880
i don't want a heart attack i don't want

400
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,120
a future heart attack

401
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,880
okay anybody in the health scene that's

402
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,360
promoting butter is just

403
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,519
somebody who's oblivious to the

404
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,000
heart-stopping power of butter

405
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,560
you know i heard one time someone says

406
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,440
nah

407
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,199
butter has healing power i'm like that's

408
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,279
a head scratcher to me because butter

409
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,120
has got heart stopping power

410
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,120
that's heart stopping power

411
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,000
that butter builds up in your heart

412
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,320
builds up in your arteries you guys

413
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,399
that's what it does it builds up in your

414
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
arteries it folds up in your heart

415
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,279
the butter builds up in here look

416
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,320
right in there inside your heart the

417
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
butter builds up

418
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,800
in the valves over time that's what the

419
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,639
butter does

420
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,360
it's got to keep you butter free

421
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,480
courtney mma butterfree right

422
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,120
radical fats we get in trouble maybe

423
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,279
you're not doing butter maybe you're hip

424
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,639
are you a hipster are you hip

425
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,600
are you doing the coconut oil you found

426
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,800
like the new way

427
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,920
coconut oil still is gonna it's still

428
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,000
gonna build up

429
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,320
in the arteries and veins over time

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,079
if too much fat's in your diet it's

431
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,800
still going to build up in your heart

432
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,360
and arteries and veins over time

433
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,880
keep that in mind even the healthy fats

434
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,360
you use them sparingly

435
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,560
you use them carefully you respect them

436
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,000
people have no respect for fats laura

437
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,519
says why doesn't it melt

438
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
in our bodies and flush out

439
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,639
well laura really good question

440
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,480
so fat has to be dispersed it has to

441
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,440
break down inside her body so it has to

442
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,760
be dispersed

443
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,880
and it gets dispersed right here so this

444
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,279
is how it goes

445
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,920
okay put the i'm going gonna put the

446
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,040
liver back

447
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,639
inside this this guy right here for some

448
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,480
reason this guy's stomach is acting

449
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,720
weird over here

450
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
so

451
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,199
when you eat the fats your liver has to

452
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,440
produce something

453
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:48,880
that's really really astringent

454
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,920
right and that's your bile that bile

455
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,040
has to break down the butter that's its

456
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,800
role that's its

457
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,800
job it has to break it down okay

458
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,320
so when you're having that butter on

459
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,000
your grilled cheese sandwiches you just

460
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,720
cooked your grilled cheese

461
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,440
right and you got you you put butter in

462
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,240
the pan right

463
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,399
you did all that that butter has to

464
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,320
break down that cheese has to break down

465
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,440
too so how is it going to break down

466
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,160
the heat of your body isn't enough

467
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,480
so the heat of your body is not enough

468
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,680
to break those fats down

469
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,040
you need more than that you need a

470
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,560
dissolver

471
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,839
so your bile is a fat dissolver

472
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,839
right you got another fat dissolver

473
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,839
it's your adrenaline

474
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,639
adrenaline is a is a fat thinner it's a

475
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
blood thinner so

476
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,160
these are your adrenals right here the

477
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,920
more fat you put in your body

478
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,000
the more adrenaline you're going to have

479
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,839
to use then your hormones start

480
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,040
to go out of whack as the years go on

481
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,320
because you've been burning out your

482
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,320
adrenals by using it for fats

483
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,160
so you're using your adrenals for fats

484
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,079
all these years

485
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,600
and then they start to break down and

486
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,959
guess what your adrenals re

487
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,959
your adrenals produce reproductive

488
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:14,000
hormones

489
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:18,640
they also produce feel good hormones

490
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
adrenals are a hormone producer

491
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,199
your liver is a hormone producer

492
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,559
so our hormone systems break down

493
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,400
because we fat them to death

494
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
we fatter adrenals to death because they

495
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,919
have to actually create something so

496
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,120
corrosive that it dissolves fat in the

497
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,000
bloodstream and then

498
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,559
and then we have to push the liver

499
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,559
beyond its limits to to create enough

500
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,280
bile to break down and dissolve fat

501
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,600
too so we're doing all this and we're

502
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,559
wearing ourselves down we're wearing

503
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,320
ourselves down

504
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,840
there's just a couple of things right

505
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,080
here i mean we can go into this

506
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,200
all day on how fat works but i gotta

507
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,559
make some food for you guys too

508
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:04,320
lemons don't ruin teeth

509
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:07,360
they don't ruin teeth

510
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,480
if they did i don't think i'd have a

511
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,600
tooth left i don't think i would have

512
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,480
one left

513
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,280
because you got to understand something

514
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,320
i've eaten

515
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,360
lemons for years and decades suck on

516
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,520
them

517
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,640
i actually do the lemon water every

518
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
single day

519
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,280
like lemon is in my life every day all

520
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,360
day long one way or another

521
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,360
and i don't have the whole veneers thing

522
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,799
i don't have implants i don't my teeth

523
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,080
aren't all drilled i don't have all

524
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,320
these problems i don't have

525
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,679
abscesses i don't have gum disease i

526
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,440
don't have cavities i don't have

527
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:44,080
i don't have um bridges i don't have

528
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,120
dentures i don't need to get the veneers

529
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,799
i don't need to get off

530
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,240
so all implants don't like i said no

531
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,200
root canals right

532
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,039
and one reason right is making sure

533
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,039
mineralized leafy greens you're doing

534
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,160
all that stuff another reason is lemons

535
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,559
keep your teeth

536
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,679
they keep your teeth i don't do vinegar

537
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,520
i don't do

538
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,679
vinegars i don't do and i'm not 25 30

539
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,120
years old i know 25 30 year old people

540
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,400
that just you know

541
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,600
25 30 year old uh you know and they're

542
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,559
and they're just their teeth are just

543
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,600
all falling apart

544
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,640
falling out right i'm not spraying

545
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,440
chicken

546
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,400
and the reason why i've kept my teeth in

547
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
check

548
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,520
is no vinegar keeping the vinegar

549
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,039
vinegar's the teeth destroyer

550
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,559
caffeine is the teeth destroyer right

551
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,919
caffeine industry they're if if they

552
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,320
actually did not exist you wouldn't

553
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,880
believe the dental industry would be

554
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,080
like

555
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,000
they would be lost they would be lost

556
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,640
you know the dental industry is like it

557
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,880
is because of all the caffeine

558
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,799

590
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,919
mary fox then why did lemon water have a

591
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,440
wearing effect on my teeth when i drank

592
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,640
it for several months

593
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,080
i did use to drink cacao drinks and eat

594
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,400
things with vinegar

595
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,679
is sauerkraut good for you okay so

596
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,799
here's how it works

597
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,200
teeth are a time capsule okay

598
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,240
if you do vinegar there's going to be

599
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
this moment where

600
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,960
everything finally gets pushed over the

601
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,200
edge and your teeth just fall apart

602
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,520
that's just how it works you can do this

603
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,799
someone can be 25 years old do vinegar

604
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,039
their teeth aren't going to fall apart

605
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,919
in two months not it

606
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:29,120
they're going to be 32 years old and

607
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,360
it's just going to start falling apart

608
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,840
and if they could have rolled up they

609
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,039
could have rode in a hot air balloon

610
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,159
the day the dentist said your teeth are

611
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,679
falling apart

612
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,760
and it would have been the hot air

613
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,520
balloon they floated in with friends

614
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,880
that caused the problem you see how it

615
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,799
works

616
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,640
they could have taken a boat ride on a

617
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,559
lake

618
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,159
and then it was around the time their

619
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,919
teeth just crumbled and you can just say

620
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,039
what was the boat ride i haven't been in

621
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,280
a lake i haven't

622
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,320
been i haven't been in a boat ride for a

623
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,039
long time

624
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,400
it's easy to blend you can start coconut

625
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,320
oil for the first time in your life

626
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,960
where i'm doing oil pulling now and your

627
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,760
teeth just

628
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,679
fall apart in one month it's not because

629
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,960
coconut oil coconut pulling

630
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,640
you know oil pulling did it

631
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,320
even though it causes gum disease oil

632
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,960
pulling does cause cause

633
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,240
long term it does cause gum disease the

634
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,919
point is is

635
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,600
it's like but you're gonna think it was

636
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,120
the oil pulling that did it in that

637
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,960
month you just started the oil pulling

638
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,880
meanwhile it's all the vinegar you did

639
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,000
in caffeine you did in cacao and

640
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,799
chocolate

641
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
by the way the oil pulling it coats

642
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,880
bacteria

643
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,280
so bacteria can thrive so when you do

644
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,320
your

645
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,640
coconut oil pulling there

646
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,640
right you're just gonna you're you're

647
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
gonna set yourself up for gum disease

648
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,200
down the road

649
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,240
you're gonna coat your gums and coat

650
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
your teeth you're gonna keep the

651
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,840
bacteria sealed in there

652
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,840
underneath the oil is what you're gonna

653
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
do

654
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,200
to buffer acidity your body leeches the

655
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,480
calcium over time out of the teeth until

656
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,720
the teeth become

657
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,400
weak to a point where they just start

658
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,960
falling apart or the cavities start

659
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,520
happening fast

660
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,080
and you could have been you know at a

661
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,760
fair

662
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,480
somewhere you could have been like

663
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,000
in a hot air balloon that day and you'll

664
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,400
think it's a hot air balloon you'll

665
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,159
think it's whatever

666
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,159
you could have eaten fish for the first

667
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
time in years

668
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,039
and think maybe it's because i've been

669
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,280
eating fish for two weeks and my teeth

670
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,120
just started falling apart

671
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,000
but no it's other things it's this

672
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,799
demineralized situation it's the acids

673
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,559
in our body

674
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,080
situation and then it's the calcium

675
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,520
leaching from all the

676
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,200
vinegar and all that stuff

677
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,480

celery juice is not high in glucose but

877
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,519
it has glucose in it

878
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,000
it stops your adrenals from flooding

879
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,559
it's enough glucose to keep it so you

880
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,559
don't

881
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,200

888
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,080
to you because they'll be maxed out

889
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,360

890
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,480
so making

891
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,480

so glad you're on there

947
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,799
omegas are not the same as cooking oils

948
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,159
they are very different

949
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,399
spot on you know the reason why i got to

950
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,000
stop the juicer for a second okay

951
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,320
because here here's what's interesting

952
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
all right

953
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,320
you know what you can't live free from

954
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,480

955
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,079
glucose you know why you die

956
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,520
really quick you die really fast

957
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,919
that's why and

958
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,599
if you don't get glucose to the brain in

959
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,720
under 10 seconds your brain tissue

960
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,119
starts to die

961
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,800
in under five seconds it starts to die

962
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,800
when diabetics get low blood sugar they

963
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,639
hit the floor

964
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,639
i can't say how many stories i heard

965
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,560
from doctors and other people

966
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,240
all through the years including myself

967
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,280
by saving somebody's life with a little

968
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,320
orange juice i happen to have on hand

969
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:49,280

about to go into a diabetic coma

971
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,159
i had to actually take my orange juice

972
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,280
and get it into the mouth of the diet of

973
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,000
the diabetic

974
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,880
while they were still coherent and still

975
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,880
able to swallow

976
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:08,160
glucose we can't live without

977
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,760
fat you can take all the fat away you

978
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,160
can still live to be whatever age you're

979
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,160

980
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,280
you take the fat out it's okay

981
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,520

so let's keep on juicing a little bit

1000
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,520
your brain has to get glucose before it

1001
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,320
starts to die isn't it interesting

1002
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,320
then interesting

1003
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,480
the more fat your brain gets in your

1004
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,720
bloodstream

1005
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,720
the more oxygen your brain loses

1006
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,160
the more fat in your bloodstream every

1007
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,119
day the less oxygen

1008
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,119
inside your brain

1009
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:40,160

blood sugar have you noticed that

1011
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,200
why are they measuring blood sugar

1012
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,599
how come they're not measuring blood fat

1013
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,240

because people are suckers

1038
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,119
they should check the blood fat levels

1039
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,960
and see how dangerous they are

1040
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,880
and see why someone's probably gonna

1041
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,560
have a heart attack

1042
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,880

oh we can't how come oh it's

1056
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,359
medical research and science doesn't

1057
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,480
know about the blood fat

1058
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,860
so what do we do check the blood sugar

1059
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,680

mm critics

1075
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,960
they're supposed to be checking for

1076
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,760
blood fat you guys

[Music]

1078
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,640
but they don't they check for blood

1079
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,280
sugar because yes blood sugar is

1080
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,720
critical

1081
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,160
they're also supposed to be checking

1082
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,280
blood fat that's really what they're

1083
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,720
supposed to be checking because when you

1084
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,800
check the blood fat then you can find

1085
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,880
out the insulin resistance for real

1086
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,760
then you can find out that there's a

1087
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,839
pandemic of insulin resistance

1088
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,599
it's the high fats not letting the sugar

1089
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,760
into your cells how many times

1090
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,880
times have i mentioned that so high fats

1091
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,079
not letting sugar

1092
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:26,400
into the cells that's how it works

1093
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,400
that's what creates high blood sugar

1094
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,079
talked about that all the time you guys

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,560
bringing these peppers down i'll let

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,440
this pepper down a little bit the onion

1101
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,079
down a little bit

1102
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,359

life to do an oil slick

1108
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,319

1299
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,680
maybe

1300
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,720
you're the lucky one that stumbled

1301
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,520
across somebody saying

1302
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,920
oxalates oxalates is that my problem

1303
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,520
whoa

1304
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,200
i didn't know it it's oxalates all this

1305
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,599
time or you know

1306
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,960
that those paid for campaigns like

1307
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,559
collecting campaigns

1308
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,160
so you can sell electing supplements

1309
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,119
like wait a minute i'm sick because of

1310
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,559
lectins

1311
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,000
first of all countless people are

1312
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,359
healing on medical medium information

1313
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,839
and they don't even think about the word

1314
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,040
lectin

1315
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,440
because lectins have nothing to do with

1316
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,280
healing or not but once you get down

1317
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,640
that road you're stuck you're stuck in

1318
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,200
that road man

1319
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,040
that road of misinformation the reason

1320
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,800
why we get the bloating the hives the

1321
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,920
histamines raise up and the fructose

1322
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,079
intolerance

1323
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,599
and um we get these we get these issues

1324
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,280
because the liver gets stagnant and

1325
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:20,319
sluggish it gets

1326
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,440
funky it gets gross it gets

1327
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:26,160
yucky inside that liver the liver gets

1328
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,599
yucky and bad inside of there that's

1329
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,599
what happens yucky and bad

1330
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,480
no one's getting fructose intolerant you

1331
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,599
can't be fructose intolerant that's just

1332
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,760
a fancy name for insulin resistance

1333
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,119
right you guys that's just a fancy name

1334
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,440
for insulin resistance

1335
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,559
you can't become fructose intolerant

1336
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:50,160
it's not possible on any level

1337
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:55,599
you can't be fructose intolerant

1338
00:50:50,160 --> 00:51:00,319
but not cane sugar intolerant see

1339
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,319
you can't be you can't be

1340
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,559
carbohydrate intolerant

1341
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,079
with it just being a fructose you can't

1342
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,760
just be

1343
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:14,480
fructose intolerant it means you're

1344
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,440
all carbohydrate sugars and all

1345
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,000
intolerant

1346
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,960
but no one's intolerant of the basic

1347
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,880
needs your brain needs or you die

1348
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,640
okay so the the foundation of your

1349
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,000
existence is blood

1350
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:32,160
sugar you die without it you die without

1351
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,079
blood without your blood having sugar in

1352
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,559
it so you mean to tell me people are

1353
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,480
fructose intolerant

1354
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,559
first of all that's telling them they're

1355
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,599
sugar intolerant

1356
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,200
if you're sugar intolerant it's

1357
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,000
impossible

1358
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,720
your body is born and bred for thousands

1359
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,440
of years

1360
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,480
millions of years humans humans existed

1361
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,920
you existed in this

1362
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,680
if you want to believe they existed in

1363
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,800
this universe

1364
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,960
for millions of years okay

1365
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,480
say you just believe humans existed for

1366
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,079
ten thousand years

1367
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,760
on earth say you're somebody that just

1368
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,240
believes it's ten thousand years humans

1369
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,079
only existed on earth

1370
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,440
say you're somebody that believes humans

1371
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,839
existed for a million years

1372
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,480
for 10 million years whatever you

1373
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:22,240
believe

1374
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:27,839
the human body needs glucose

1375
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,839
in order to run to function to thrive

1376
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:36,240
no one's fructose intolerant

1377
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,800
that's a scam that test isn't even real

1378
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,880
it means you're all sugar intolerant no

1379
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,520
one's sugar intolerant because you need

1380
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,520
glucose

1381
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,800
but what they're not saying is you got

1382
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,480
insulin resistance

1383
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,440
it's a it's like a back-handed backwoods

1384
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,040
way

1385
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,040
of saying you're insulin resistant

1386
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:05,280
salicylate intolerance

1387
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,000
is really also something that's kind of

1388
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,400
made up

1389
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,880
no one's salicylate intolerant no one's

1390
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,000
no one's glucose intolerant no one's

1391
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,680
salicylate

1392
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,960
intolerant there's foods where

1393
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,520

uh-huh yeah it's an exercise they say

1553
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,720
it's good for your lymphatic system

1554
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:48,880
yeah i'm going to focus on that okay

1555
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:51,680
all right what what lymphatic system

1556
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,319
is your second filter what's your first

1557
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,200
filter

1558
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:56,400
what do you mean filter your liver is

1559
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,440
your first filter

1560
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,119
really what does that mean

1561
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,079
so if you don't clean your liver your

1562
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,680
lymphatic system perpetually stays dirty

1563
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,119
well how come my doctor doesn't know

1564
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,720
this

1565
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,799
because my doctor doesn't even know why

1566
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,440
i'm sick to begin with

1567
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:16,319
i think it's starting to make some sense

1568
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,319
okay i gotta go

1569
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:24,000
massage helps move stuff around yeah

1570
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,599
it starts to move fluid around but if

1571
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,480
you don't fix the problem you're not

1572
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,960
gonna you're

1573
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,319
you're not gonna get okay just yeah

1574
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,760
you're gonna have to do the sauna every

1575
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,880
day you're gonna have to do the massage

1576
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,520
every single day you're gonna have to

1577
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,480

01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,680
your lymphatic system but it's a

1580
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,280
never-ending vicious cycle and you can't

1581
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,559
clean it because it's dirty all the time

1582
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,000
because you can't fix your liver no

1583
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,960

great food right here sorry about all

1720
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,119
the noise

1721
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,480
super gentle on the intestinal tract

1722
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,280
really gentle on the intestinal tract

1723
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,559
be cautious about the fruit fear being

1724
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,960
created by

1725
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,160
the practitioners out there that have

1726
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,880
misinformation

1727
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,480
because it started out as a as a total

1728
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,799
attack on fruit

1729
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,680
originally by the upper echelon of the

1730
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:33,680
medical industry

1731
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,680
and then they put plants out there to

1732
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,440
spread it

1733
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,720
long ago you want the banana ripe but

1734
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,160
you don't want it over ripe because you

1735
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,760
don't want it fermented but you don't

1736
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,280
want it under ripe you want you don't

1737
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,520
want the banana under ripe

1738
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,400
you don't want the banana over ripe keep

1739
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,520
that in mind

1740
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,280
really good tips right there you don't

1741
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,280
want the banana overripe you don't want

1742
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,520
the banana under ripe

1743
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,039
under ripe then it's fermented you just

1744
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,640
you know fermented food i don't like

1745
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,240
fermented food

1746
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,640
don't like it at all for a lot of

1747
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,640
reasons

1748
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:16,000
overripe gets you in trouble when it's

1749
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,319
over over ripe you don't want the banana

1750
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,400
so

1751
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,719
over ripe you don't want the skin so

1752
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,799
brown and the bananas mushy

1753
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:24,080
you don't want to do that because then

1754
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,560
it's just it's just it's starting to

1755
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,560
ferment

1756
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,040
you don't want to do that i get hungry

1757
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,799
after eating potatoes make sure you're

1758
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,400
doing leafy greens in your diet

01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:40,080

1770
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:02,159
delicious

1771
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,159
notice that i didn't put salt in there

1772
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,120
if you really can't live without some

1773
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,040
salt and you want a little in there

1774
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,719
as long as you're fat free that's a

1775
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,799
major plus

1776
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:17,759

1777
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,759
being fat free

01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:23,279
look maybe you can save this meal here

1779
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:24,719
maybe you can do like a fruit bowl after

1780
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,679
you had your celery juice and lemon

1781
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,600
water right

1782
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,600
and you can then save this for lunch and

1783
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,520
then have a fat free lunch and go a

1784
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,880
little bit longer fat free how amazing

1785
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,839
is that

1786
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,679
there's thousands of combinations

1787
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,880
thousands of combinations to heal and

1788
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,279
medical medium books

1789
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,520
and information just so you know it's

01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,560
all here there's no one medical medium

1791
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,400
protocol

1792
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:49,279
just try to be you know try to keep that

1793
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,839

1796
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,120
its fullest extent or you're not doing

time you had vinegar

1930
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,800
because vinegar will stop somebody from

1931
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,440
healing

1932
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,960
vinegar will stop some body from healing

1933
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,679
i'm telling you right now that's the

1934
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,679
dish right there

1935
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,239
the vinegar goes down goes in the body

1936
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,480
boom

1937
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:24,880
you stopped from healing you're not

1938
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,640
healing anymore you're not healing

1939
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,040
your blood turns to acid you have

1940
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,880
kombucha tea goes inside the body

1941
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,239
boom you're not healing anymore your

1942
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,480
blood turns acid

1943
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:35,440
that's what happens your blood turns

1944
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,600
acid

1945
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,040
your healing slows down your healing

1946
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,560
stops

1947
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,480
for a lot of people with that right

1948
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,640
there okay

1949
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,159
and i'm keeping people from getting a

1950
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,760
lot of lot worse and

1951
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:49,280
and when you're when you're a detective

1952
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,560
for people you help them from getting a

1953
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,480
lot worse you're actually helping them

1954
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,239
you're saving their butt you're at least

1955
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,440
helping to slow it down

1956
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:58,000
for them you know when you when people

1957
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,280
are doing

1958
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,480
you're doing stuff they're doing

1959
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,520
nutritional yeast they're doing the

1960
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,520
vinegar

1961
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,640
doing the kombucha tea they're doing

1962
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,800
their chocolate boom you stop peeling

1963
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,679
you can't heal tank and chocolate you

1964
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,000
can't

1965
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:14,880
you can't heal all the way tanking that

1966
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,520
chocolate it's not gonna happen

1967
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,280
it's not gonna happen you have to keep

1968
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,000
these things out if you wanna go all the

1969
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,719
way i'm not

1970
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,360
shaming anybody i'm not judging anybody

1971
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:27,280
that's not

1972
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:28,880
at all what it is is if you want to go

1973
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,320
the mile you actually want to heal all

1974
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,920
the way if you're really tired of being

1975
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,679
sick we got to go a little bit further

1976
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,199
because moderation doesn't fix

1977
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:40,000
us it doesn't fix us at all

1978
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,719
it doesn't fix us moderation gets us in

1979
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,440
trouble

1980
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,840
then we can't heal and then we're stuck

1981
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,920
right

1982
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,520
the problem is if you're not so sick you

1983
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,440
can dabble with all the out

1984
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,400
there you can dabble with all the trends

1985
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,239
you can dabble

1986
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,159
you can dabble if you're not so sick you

1987
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:55,679
can dabble with it all if you're not so

1988
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,679
sick you can dabble with it all

1989
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,360
