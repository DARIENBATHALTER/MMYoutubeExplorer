brain gets heated up but a certain part

197
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,479
of the brain the emotional center of the

198
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,919

there's so many of them and they talk

232
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,280
about what's going on with them if you

233
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,199
have anxiety you could be getting

234
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,039
triggered with something in your

235
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,479

that's one thing right there so when the

240
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,639
heating of the brain occurs in the

241
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,560
emotional center so that's what happens

242
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
so when you get bad news

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,599

247
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
really hard loss

248
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,919
a really

249
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,599
horrifying horrific loss and i have a

250
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,599
friend that i talked to just recently

251
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
who had a terrible loss a couple years

252
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,880
ago

253
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,800
just got awful and

254
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,839
and he was telling me that when it

255
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,839
happened

256
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,720
this loss happened

257
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,920
he got knocked off of his feet he hit

258
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,240
the ground and i told him what happened

259
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,080
was when you got delivered that news

260
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,120
when that news came in

261
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,760
the brain

262
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,160
went into extreme heat in the emotional

263
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,200
center just extreme heat in there just

264
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,360
went in the

265
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,200
like boom like a heatball

266
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
lightning going on in there and that

267
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
lightning

268
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,200
cauterizes

269
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,040
some tissue because he got anxiety after

270
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
his bad news that happened he never had

271
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,080
anxiety in his life and then after that

272
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,320
bad news when he had that terrible loss

273
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,320
all of a sudden now anxiety started to

274
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,399
creep up it started to creep up a little

275
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,200
bit at a time a little bit at a time

276
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,360
more and more and more and more

277
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,880
and as it was creeping up and getting

278
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,120
worse and worse i told him what was

in his life that happened a couple years

310

311
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,000
the brain and it just exploded with heat

312
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,480
and no one realizes that's what happens

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,240
the electricity that fires up and then

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,320
times because someone said someone said

374
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,920
to me like why do you say that it's like

375
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,600
uh because then everybody they don't

376
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,800

377
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,639
person be like well i don't know where

378
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,399

have anxiety well okay great well

466
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,759
why

467
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,800
uh you're going through some emotional

468
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,079
stress uh okay well sure but wait a

469
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,920
minute someone else is going through

470
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,839
emotional stress how come they don't

471
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,880
have it because there's real physical

472
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,160
reasons this is a serious thing i mean

473
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,880
it's debilitating for so many people um

474
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,480
claudia says i had severe anxiety to the

475
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,199
point where i couldn't walk i had

476
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,079
numbness in my arms oh my god i couldn't

477
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,360
breathe also chest pains couldn't drive

478
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,680
people can't drive when they have

479
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,440
anxiety and so many other symptoms so i

480
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,880
started changing the foods and started

481
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,360
juicing celery juice and it worked

482
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,240
celery juice and i'll tell you why

483
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,360
it's a complete electrolyte it goes to

484
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,720
the emotional center of the brain when

485
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
you drink your celery juice and you know

486
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,440
what's funny you guys i don't have a

487
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,440
celery juice right now with me i have

488
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,320
fresh squeezed orange juice

489
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,519
right that's what i have so

490
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,199
and that's what's really funny there

491
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,440
right there um but i wish i had a celery

492
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,079
just right on me right now but anyway

493
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,959
those electrolytes the sodium cluster

494
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,640
salts that are in celery juice only go

495
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,720
straight to the emotional center of the

496
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,039
brain and start booting it up start

497
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,039
giving the neurotransmitter boosts all

498
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,520
of this you know the whole bit

499
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,280
um marcelo how you doing i've been

really is medical medium stuff going all

529
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,480
the way back for 30 years and then a few

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,919
years go by and no one realizes it and

531
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,919

began suffering it myself oh my god

626
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,840
after my accident whoa it's hard to

627

accept that i have this it is the worst

628
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,720
thing i've experienced comes on so quick

629
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,159
oh that's so

630
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,760
first of all it's just unbelievable i

631
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,799
came after the accident you know i talk

632
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,559
about that i talk about how trauma

633
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,760
emotional trauma

634
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,000
accidents

635
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,320
losses all these things and then what

636
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,400
happens is the center of the emotional

637
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,400
part of the brain okay emotional center

638
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,080
of the brain it starts to heat up it

639
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,960
starts to burn up like lightning bolts

640
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,720
going through there because we're

641
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,080
electricity in here it's all electricity

642
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,679
running through our brain and those

643
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,440
lightning bolts heat up in there and

644
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,200
when they do you're just burning that

645
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,480
tissue because we have no choice that's

646
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,280
