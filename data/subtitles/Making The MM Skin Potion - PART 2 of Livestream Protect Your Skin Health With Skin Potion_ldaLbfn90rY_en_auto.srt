a lot of people get dark spots they get

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,120
black spots they get all kinds of

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,880
different stuff on their face um on

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,519
their body on their arms on their chest

00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,960
on their back and so forth a lot of

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,119
people get a lot of different skin

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,160
lesions people are up against a

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,359
tremendous amount of skin toxins that

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,800
are surfacing like I said if you guys

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,439
just got on here this is the product I

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
endorse right here this is the company I

12
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,240
endorsed because of the quality and like

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
I said if you were here a little earlier

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,480
it's really incredible

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,160
um about how it works with this product

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,920
and I was just showing you the one thing

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,559
right there that helps the skin alone is

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,520
the fact that there's no anti-caking

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,239
agents in this this product right here

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,160
which is a miracle all on its

21
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,680
own um so anyway you guys I'm going to

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,480
talk a little bit I have I have a tech

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,760
issue going on really but right now but

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,039
I'm just going to wait and see if it

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,960
kind of Remedies and then I'm going to

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,199
focus on

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,559
uh some other stuff too

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,439
what you see is some oranges right

29
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,799
here okay these oranges are going to be

30
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,880
part of the Skin

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,119
Potion all right so back to that whole

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,479
micro needling or however it would is

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,320
that that what it's called you guys

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,240
micro needling it's the thing with the

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,439
roller and all the prickly things on the

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,920
roller right and you do this on your

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,680
skin and you do your face like this when

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,680
that started getting popular I was

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,960
like ah

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,479
a nightmare

41
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,240
nightmare it's if you're not healing

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,759
your skin from underneath from

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,560
internally you'll just add to more

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,360
problems doing things like that add to

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,320
more Scar Tissue more issues around your

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,640
skin but that's how it works Trends can

47
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,560
be really bad just like the collagen

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,439
Trend it's really bad it's a waste of

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,360
money in the whole bit so when it comes

50
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,719
down to skin like I said before if

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,360
you're toxic inside and unfortunately

52
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,319
yes pretty much everybody's toxic

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,399
internally the toxins are going to get

54
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,599
pushed to the skin the skin is going to

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,599
get

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,440
problematic and no lymphatic drainage is

57
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,080
going to fix that you're just going to

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,800
be chasing your tail looking for ways of

59
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,720
fixing that and so forth so I want to

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,599
make the Skin Potion now let me go get

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,640
working on it now too so I got a glass

62
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,800

63
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,640
here little bit of a mug okay and this

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,840
is really simple

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
I'm just taking a

66
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,480
scoop

67
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:44,040
of this right here it's taking a scoop

68
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,040
putting that

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,159
scoop right in here just like that all

70
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,879
right taking two

71
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,400
capsules of the MSM that's part of the

72
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,920
Skin Potion okay so make sure you get

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,920
the MSM make sure you do that that's

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,000
important

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,640

reasons right here so many other ways

80
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,879
it's important to have

81
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,599
it but the MSM you want okay so you want

82
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,439
with the skin aspect of it so I'm going

83
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,840
to open up two

84
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,840
capsules of the MSM powder right

85
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,319

86
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:45,080

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,840
the time you're putting in there how

128
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,120

129
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,039
time on their skin on their face

130
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,319

132
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,880

to get an appointment for a facial or

137
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,880
you're trying to prepare yourself for an

138
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,880
exfoliation how long does that

139
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,599
take two hours you have to get in the

140
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:20,440
car you going to do at home did you

141
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,160
start your exfoliation

142
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,680
yet all

143
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,680
right okay there we

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,199
go all right

145
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,560
okay just made another if you were here

146
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,240
right now in my kitchen I would make

147
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,759
that one for

148
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,759
you okay there you

149
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,440
go now that's how easy it can be but you

150
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,240
get

151
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:53,759
results you get results and that's what

152
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,960
matters it's not a game that's problem

153
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,840
in the health World it all became a game

154
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,759
I really believe that at this point I

155
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,280
know there's some good intentions out

156
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,639
there and people with good intentions

157
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,400
but honestly the stuff they use or the

158
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,000
stuff they sell or promote every day is

159
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,000
not the best stuff it just isn't and

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,680
it's not going to help the

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,120
person but this is so simple and so easy

162
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,520
you can't go wrong with that when you

163
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,520
want to restore your

164
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,520
skin

165
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:29,560
now I'm going to sip this I got two of

166
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,560
them here let sip this original one

167
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,039
it's so good knowing I'm doing this for

168
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,759
myself you

169
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:40,080
know with me with my work schedule and

170
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:43,960
everything like that I got a lot going

171
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,560
on it's hard to keep up with everything

172
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,759
and so if I can do something that's

173
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,800
really simple and easy but yet help move

174
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,280
like me so far so with the immune system

175
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,319
and everything so I want to talk about

176
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,599
why this is so good too so I'm going to

177
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:03,720
give you that so the viy micro C has

178
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,599
grape seed extract in it grape seed

179
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,280
extract whole another form of

180
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:12,280
antioxidant right there grape seed

181
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:16,000
extract power of that alone in here so

182
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:19,319
that's in here along with the vitamin C

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,919
that's buffered that's not ascorbic acid

184
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,159
now here's the thing if you're going to

185
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,560
take a vitamin C every single day

186
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,800
thinking that it's going to do the same

187
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,440
thing it's not because a it's going to

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,719
be ascorbic acid that's number one on

189
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,560
you don't want vitamin C that's made

190
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,680
from ascorbic acid that becomes ascorbic

191
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,080
acid it's too harsh on your gastric

192
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,080
glands too harsh on your stomach lining

193
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,480
too harsh on your dadum too harsh on

194
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,760
your intestinal tract way too

195
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,880
harsh and when it so when it comes down

196
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,519
to vitamin C you want something that's

197
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,519
so buffered where it doesn't cause a

198
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,040
problem where you can use a lot of it

199
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,120
you can take it every single day for

200
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,680
your immune system you can take it to

201
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,920
help restore your immune system and your

202
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,640
liver and throughout your body and

203
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,120
everything that's the kind of vitamin C

204
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,760
you want it's a kind that's not ascorbic

205
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,680
acid I have to say this because people

206
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,959
