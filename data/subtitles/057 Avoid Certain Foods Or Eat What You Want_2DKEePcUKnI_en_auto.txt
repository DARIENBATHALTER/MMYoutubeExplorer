[263.28 - 268.80] citation to somebody else's article with
[266.40 - 270.72] a whole bunch of theories in there but
[268.80 - 273.84] nothing really really
[270.72 - 277.16] substantial and then the influencers who
[273.84 - 279.20] discovered food they discovered food
[277.16 - 282.64] it's like they woke up one day from
[279.20 - 286.32] their college dorm and realized that
[282.64 - 289.32] food is important now an entire movement
[286.32 - 292.56] of influencers that discover that food
[289.32 - 295.24] actually makes a difference when you
[292.56 - 298.56] change it something can happen with your
[295.24 - 301.76] health with your mental state with your
[298.56 - 303.48] mindfulness with your life in general
[301.76 - 306.12] and then people are noticing that if you
[303.48 - 308.40] say something good about food people are
[306.12 - 311.00] interested people are also noticing if
[308.40 - 313.56] you say something bad about food people
[311.00 - 316.88] are interested because let's face it if
[313.56 - 320.28] you don't eat you won't exist we have to
[316.88 - 322.88] eat in order to sustain ourselves to
[320.28 - 325.32] stay here to live to breathe to feed our
[322.88 - 328.32] brain to feed our heart we have to
[325.32 - 331.20] consume food of some kind regardless of
[328.32 - 334.00] what it is food makes a difference and
[331.20 - 336.92] so influencers are seeing that now and
[334.00 - 340.08] wo and most everybody has that aha
[336.92 - 342.80] moment that come to Jesus moment it's I
[340.08 - 346.00] can't eat myself sick of processed food
[342.80 - 349.28] anymore I know it's not helping me and I
[346.00 - 352.28] have to back down one way or another I
[349.28 - 355.36] can cheat I could have some I could
[352.28 - 357.92] limit it I could play games all I want
[355.36 - 360.20] but I have to be careful now I can't
[357.92 - 363.44] just eat everything I want and anytime I
[360.20 - 366.84] want all I can I can't just pull into
[363.44 - 369.76] that fast food restaurant and order four
[366.84 - 371.52] hot dogs with bacon and cheese two

[383.24 - 388.88] a good thing the age of bliss is
[386.60 - 390.64] disappearing right in front of us
[388.88 - 392.64] everybody and their grandmother and
[390.64 - 395.40] their cousin and their uncle and their
[392.64 - 397.32] best friend and anybody else including

[397.32 - 402.60] their pet cat knows better now or almost
[400.44 - 404.40] knows better now or is on the edge of
[402.60 - 407.76] knowing better either way something's
[404.40 - 411.00] changing out there we can't just always
[407.76 - 413.72] eat what we want a big chocolate cake
[411.00 - 415.92] have it every single night right a big
[413.72 - 418.00] juicy steak with butter on top have it
[415.92 - 420.32] every single night whole bunch of
[418.00 - 424.04] lobster with butter have it every single
[420.32 - 427.80] night big bowl of mac and cheese every
[424.04 - 430.48] single night sure every single night we
[427.80 - 433.56] can't just do that we can't just eat a
[430.48 - 435.36] dozen eggs every day yeah dozen eggs
[433.56 - 437.28] every day I know there's a few people
[435.36 - 439.80] out there're doing it and trying it or
[437.28 - 441.20] saying that they swear by it but it'll
[439.80 - 443.56] kill them in the end one way or another
[441.20 - 445.80] to eat a dozen eggs every day we just
[443.56 - 449.12] can't eat grilled cheese sandwiches all
[445.80 - 450.20] day long every day and I'm talking about
[449.12 - 453.32] Quan
[450.20 - 455.88] large amounts of this because in the end

[455.88 - 461.76] of this there are people out there that
[457.84 - 463.64] do they eat lots of this same food I'm
[461.76 - 466.52] not just talking about a little slice of

[466.52 - 471.60] about small helping of mac and cheese
[469.08 - 473.96] sure people they're careful with their
[471.60 - 475.60] portions when they eat different foods
[473.96 - 478.08] they're always worried they're always
[475.60 - 480.56] looking out but they know they can't
[478.08 - 484.04] just eat a whole gig antic chocolate
[480.56 - 486.56] cake every single day because even
[484.04 - 489.48] somebody's conventional doctor would say
[486.56 - 491.32] whoa put on the brakes put on the brakes

[491.32 - 496.76] ever Stamp Out out of a conventional

[610.24 - 614.04] money and doing good and living it up I
[612.44 - 615.92] don't think they really care about the
[614.04 - 618.68] chronically ill they're not holding a
[615.92 - 620.36] packaged food item that's filled with
[618.68 - 621.88] chemicals because they're really
[620.36 - 623.96] concerned that you're going to get that
[621.88 - 626.88] chemical in your body and it's going to
[623.96 - 628.72] make you sick like they really care and
[626.88 - 630.84] it's all fun out there it's all fun in
[628.72 - 632.96] games when you're you're not that sick
[630.84 - 634.52] when you're hardly sick and it's kind of
[632.96 - 636.08] fun just getting rid of some processed
[634.52 - 638.68] foods eating better doing some
[636.08 - 640.96] meditation doing some yoga changing your
[638.68 - 643.24] lifestyle for the better and if you're
[640.96 - 645.80] not so sick and you only have some mild
[643.24 - 647.28] symptoms that come and go or go away
[645.80 - 648.64] completely because you got rid of the
[647.28 - 650.08] processed foods and you're taking care
[648.64 - 652.48] of yourself you're sleeping a little bit
[650.08 - 654.68] more you're living a better lifestyle in
[652.48 - 656.08] some way a healthier way and you're
[654.68 - 659.60] getting rid of some symptoms now you're
[656.08 - 662.24] an expert total expert now but are you
[659.60 - 664.60] really an expert because there's a big
[662.24 - 667.32] difference a very big difference from
[664.60 - 669.56] being not so sick and being really sick
[667.32 - 672.08] and being seasoned with that trying
[669.56 - 674.72] everything been there done that lots of
[672.08 - 677.80] doctors been sick a long time tried
[674.72 - 680.84] virtually almost everything and being
[677.80 - 682.64] not so sick getting rid of One symptom
[680.84 - 685.28] eating better taking care of yourself in
[682.64 - 687.04] general symptom comes and goes you feel
[685.28 - 689.72] stronger more confident feel like you
[687.04 - 691.36] know health and wellness big big
[689.72 - 694.80] difference right there two different
[691.36 - 698.08] worlds two different worlds completely
[694.80 - 700.24] The Not So Sick and the very very sick a
[698.08 - 702.84] sick person who's been around the block
[700.24 - 704.64] knows a thing or two they know what
[702.84 - 706.48] works for them what doesn't work for
[704.64 - 709.04] them at that point especially if they've
[706.48 - 711.28] been in it for years and they also know
[709.04 - 713.88] when they find something that makes
[711.28 - 715.72] sense and actually works and they can
[713.88 - 717.20] feel it and they're moving forward in
[715.72 - 720.16] their life and they're getting rid of
[717.20 - 722.24] some symptoms shedding me maybe even 10
[720.16 - 725.12] symptoms they know they got something
[722.24 - 727.44] it's gold and they've been on a search
[725.12 - 729.72] long and hard for many years so when
[727.44 - 731.64] they find that thing they hold on to it
[729.72 - 734.44] they hold on to it with conviction
[731.64 - 736.24] because they know it is saving them and
[734.44 - 737.60] then they're not so sick that are
[736.24 - 739.32] playing around with all kinds of
[737.60 - 740.84] different foods they're looking out for
[739.32 - 742.60] some of the bad stuff they're looking
[740.84 - 744.72] out for some of the good stuff they're
[742.60 - 746.36] trying different things they feel
[744.72 - 748.20] something might be helping them they
[746.36 - 750.56] feel something might not be helping them
[748.20 - 752.80] but until they're really sick will they
[750.56 - 756.00] ever have that conviction will they ever
[752.80 - 758.16] really know and have that inner truth
[756.00 - 761.16] what happens is The Not So Sick will
[758.16 - 763.28] just play games try this and try that do
[761.16 - 766.16] this and do that and they'll just EB and
[763.28 - 768.24] flow and they'll go along for the ride
[766.16 - 771.32] they're not that sick they can do it
[768.24 - 773.88] until the scale tips someday and they go
[771.32 - 776.32] downward and then they're like oh my God
[773.88 - 778.92] those things aren't helping me anymore
[776.32 - 780.84] but until that downfall happens until
[778.92 - 783.96] they hit that rock bottom or head down
[780.84 - 786.08] to that direction they sit up here way
[783.96 - 788.04] up and they're just like yeah I know
[786.08 - 789.64] what I'm doing I'm going to tell you how
[788.04 - 792.44] to heal I'm going to tell you how to
[789.64 - 794.96] take care of yourself the thing is I've
[792.44 - 797.84] seen this thousands and thousands and
[794.96 - 801.00] thousands of times I've seen people play
[797.84 - 804.04] around up there being not so sick and
[801.00 - 806.96] then the scale tip and then they go
[804.04 - 809.48] downwards and they're getting humbled
[806.96 - 811.44] takes a little time doesn't happen fast
[809.48 - 813.84] depends on the entitlement or who they
[811.44 - 815.84] are or where they come from or their
[813.84 - 817.84] resources and when they start heading
[815.84 - 819.76] down and they're like weit a minute
[817.84 - 822.88] something isn't changing I'm really
[819.76 - 825.76] stuck down here I don't feel good then
[822.88 - 827.80] The Humbling starts to happen and then
[825.76 - 830.16] they come knocking on a door cuz they
[827.80 - 832.44] already knocked on 50 other doors and
[830.16 - 834.60] they're still sick they knock on a door
[832.44 - 836.44] and they're like you know what I like
[834.60 - 839.68] what you're talking about I need some
[836.44 - 842.28] answers these look like real answers so
[839.68 - 845.36] let's Jump Ahead let's put aside food
[842.28 - 848.16] chemicals let's put aside fast food and
[845.36 - 850.68] greasy fried foods let's put aside
[848.16 - 852.28] processed foods say you're somebody and
[850.68 - 854.04] you're already pass that you're not
[852.28 - 856.24] doing any of that or you believe you're
[854.04 - 859.04] not doing any of that maybe some slips
[856.24 - 861.68] in by default but you're trying to
[859.04 - 865.08] really avoid that in your life you're
[861.68 - 867.52] wise but you're still sick and you're
[865.08 - 869.56] not getting fully better and you're
[867.52 - 872.00] avoiding virtually
[869.56 - 875.68] most of that or all of that and whatever
[872.00 - 879.60] your sickness is inflammation is playing
[875.68 - 881.48] a role you've heard that before inflamed
[879.60 - 884.80] inflammation and the other thing that's
[881.48 - 886.60] playing a role is immune system weakened
[884.80 - 888.56] immune system and
[886.60 - 891.12] inflammation but what does that mean in
[888.56 - 893.32] the end if you go to a practitioner or
[891.12 - 894.68] healthc care provider or a medical
[893.32 - 896.32] professional and they say you're
[894.68 - 898.64] inflamed or you have some form of
[896.32 - 900.76] inflammation or markers are up and
[898.64 - 902.92] you're inflamed in some way and they say
[900.76 - 905.08] well you either got autoimmune or you
[902.92 - 907.36] have some form of inflammation
[905.08 - 909.04] something's going on here your Ana is
[907.36 - 911.96] high your markers are high whatever it
[909.04 - 914.84] may be whatever test you did what's the
[911.96 - 918.60] answer in the end where's the
[914.84 - 923.12] answers because it comes down to this
[918.60 - 927.52] pathogens and metals bugs and
[923.12 - 929.60] toxins viruses bacteria and poisons
[927.52 - 931.92] toxins and metals
[929.60 - 934.24] pathogens create this inflammation
[931.92 - 937.84] that's inside of people's bodies mystery
[934.24 - 940.20] chronic illness pathogens love toxins
[937.84 - 942.88] and metals and feed off of toxins and
[940.20 - 943.64] metals and then that also Spurs on lots
[942.88 - 946.04] of
[943.64 - 948.64] inflammation pathogens eat the toxins
[946.04 - 951.12] and the poisons and the metals and then
[948.64 - 954.12] they excrete the poison out of their
[951.12 - 957.32] little viral cells and pathogen cells
[954.12 - 960.28] but pathogens also eat other things they
[957.32 - 962.16] eat Foods because this is one of the
[960.28 - 965.68] biggest and most important missing links
[962.16 - 968.64] here it's what feeds pathogens food that
[965.68 - 971.36] pathogens like so it's not about being
[968.64 - 973.40] the food police out there don't eat this
[971.36 - 977.52] and don't eat that it's about having
[973.40 - 979.92] real reason to not eat this or that when
[977.52 - 982.72] you have a chronic illness there's a
[979.92 - 985.32] reason to avoid a certain food it's not
[982.72 - 987.76] just about shaming somebody about a food
[985.32 - 989.96] or saying you shouldn't eat all that you
[987.76 - 992.56] shouldn't eat a loaf of bread and a
[989.96 - 994.32] stick of butter every day it's not about
[992.56 - 996.24] that because there's people out there
[994.32 - 998.32] that can eat a loaf of bread every day
[996.24 - 1000.96] and a stick of butter and they may not
[998.32 - 1003.32] have the same inflammation as somebody
[1000.96 - 1005.16] else who's eating pretty good because
[1003.32 - 1007.40] they may not have the pathogens that
[1005.16 - 1011.04] somebody else has they may not have the
[1007.40 - 1012.92] viruses and the bacteria so when they're
[1011.04 - 1015.92] eating a loaf of bread and a stick of
[1012.92 - 1019.04] butter it may not be feeding the same
[1015.92 - 1021.24] pathogens that someone else has and
[1019.04 - 1023.88] let's face it if anybody's trying to eat
[1021.24 - 1025.44] healthy that's because something's wrong
[1023.88 - 1026.88] because why would they just give up all
[1025.44 - 1028.36] the pizza they wanted and all the
[1026.88 - 1030.60] macaroni and cheese and all the
[1028.36 - 1032.84] cheeseburgers and all the ice cream and
[1030.60 - 1035.56] all the milkshakes why would they just
[1032.84 - 1037.60] give that up they're either sick or they
[1035.56 - 1040.00] want to look a certain way it's either
[1037.60 - 1042.44] one or the other and looking a certain
[1040.00 - 1044.40] way may not be enough motivation because
[1042.44 - 1047.24] you'll still have your cheat days and so
[1044.40 - 1050.52] forth as time goes on and pathogens
[1047.24 - 1053.04] don't discriminate pathogens don't say
[1050.52 - 1055.80] well those are children those are
[1053.04 - 1058.04] teenagers those are young adults those
[1055.80 - 1061.72] are people in their 30s those are people
[1058.04 - 1064.24] in their 40s hm let's see let's not be a
[1061.72 - 1066.40] pathogen in an 8-year-old let's only be
[1064.24 - 1068.00] a pathogen in a 50-year-old it doesn't
[1066.40 - 1070.36] work that way that's why there's a lot
[1068.00 - 1072.96] of sick kids pathogens all kinds of
[1070.36 - 1075.24] different bugs pathogens like viruses
[1072.96 - 1076.92] and bacteria will be in children they'll
[1075.24 - 1079.80] be in teenagers they'll be in young
[1076.92 - 1082.44] adults they'll be in anybody anywhere
[1079.80 - 1085.00] anyhow there's no discrimination they're
[1082.44 - 1088.12] just in everyone at any time and the
[1085.00 - 1090.76] same thing happens pathogens and toxins
[1088.12 - 1094.12] creating inflammation pathogens and
[1090.76 - 1096.76] metals creating inflammation so when it
[1094.12 - 1100.60] comes down to avoiding a food there
[1096.76 - 1103.72] needs to be a reason like seriously a
[1100.60 - 1107.04] very important reason to avoid a certain
[1103.72 - 1111.08] food and that important reason is to not
[1107.04 - 1114.12] feed a bug because foods can feed bugs
[1111.08 - 1117.12] pathogens viruses and bacteria Epstein
[1114.12 - 1122.28] bar shingles hhv6
[1117.12 - 1126.16] hhv7 undiscovered hhv 10 through 16 hsv1
[1122.28 - 1128.68] hsv2 the herpes simplexes sedam virus
[1126.16 - 1135.52] and many more many mutations many
[1128.68 - 1137.76] different strains strep staff CI hpylori
[1135.52 - 1139.92] anything and different bugs have
[1137.76 - 1142.60] different appetites they like different
[1139.92 - 1144.56] foods for different reasons for one
[1142.60 - 1147.20] thing a bug might have been in somebody
[1144.56 - 1148.64] else before you caught that bug a bug
[1147.20 - 1150.20] might have been sitting in somebody else
[1148.64 - 1152.64] and then eating a diet that that
[1150.20 - 1156.20] somebody else fed that bug and that bug
[1152.64 - 1158.64] has been used to that very diet and then
[1156.20 - 1161.56] that bug gets contracted into somebody
[1158.64 - 1163.56] else someone actually gets that bug
[1161.56 - 1165.88] maybe they drank off of somebody's glass
[1163.56 - 1168.24] maybe they shared a bodily fluid or
[1165.88 - 1169.88] maybe off of a shopping cart handle you
[1168.24 - 1171.64] touch the handle then you put your
[1169.88 - 1175.20] finger in your eyee and then you got a
[1171.64 - 1177.80] bug and that bug has a history it has a
[1175.20 - 1180.28] past bugs have a past when they come
[1177.80 - 1182.92] from other people they had a different
[1180.28 - 1185.76] diet different foods so maybe you were
[1182.92 - 1188.12] fine eating corn you've been eating corn
[1185.76 - 1192.88] every year you eat corn in different
[1188.12 - 1195.88] ways corn flour tortilla chips corn off
[1192.88 - 1198.48] the cob you eat frozen corn any kind of
[1195.88 - 1201.24] corn cornbread and everything's fine and
[1198.48 - 1205.04] then then a bug you picked up recently
[1201.24 - 1207.72] some exposure that had a corn diet from
[1205.04 - 1209.64] another person is now in you and now
[1207.72 - 1211.12] you're eating corn and you're eating
[1209.64 - 1213.12] corn and you're eating corn and
[1211.12 - 1215.00] something's changing you're not feeling
[1213.12 - 1216.64] good you're getting sicker something's
[1215.00 - 1219.60] wrong and you don't even know it but
[1216.64 - 1222.04] that bug is feasting off of that corn
[1219.60 - 1224.92] and eliminating toxins growing
[1222.04 - 1227.08] proliferating getting stronger and
[1224.92 - 1229.00] you're getting weaker you might be a
[1227.08 - 1230.68] person that always did good with glut
[1229.00 - 1232.08] you saw everybody else wasn't doing good
[1230.68 - 1234.04] with gluten you hear about it all the
[1232.08 - 1236.64] time you see gluten-free products
[1234.04 - 1241.04] everywhere and you could eat plain old
[1236.64 - 1243.52] straight Pizza glutened in bread anytime
[1241.04 - 1246.56] you want and everything's fine and then
[1243.52 - 1248.96] one day all of a sudden you get a bug
[1246.56 - 1252.64] you catch somebody else's bug maybe it's
[1248.96 - 1255.52] a strap you catch that strap loves to
[1252.64 - 1257.76] Feast on gluten and that strap was in
[1255.52 - 1260.24] somebody else's body and it was feasting
[1257.76 - 1263.48] on gluten all the time and reproducing
[1260.24 - 1265.44] itself and wreaking havoc UTI all the
[1263.48 - 1268.88] time bladder infections kidney
[1265.44 - 1272.28] infections St conjunctivitis lung
[1268.88 - 1274.04] infections sore throats ear infections
[1272.28 - 1277.16] all kinds of different headaches and so
[1274.04 - 1279.24] forth and that strep was flying high and
[1277.16 - 1282.24] it was feeding off of that gluten and
[1279.24 - 1284.64] now that strep bug got into you somehow
[1282.24 - 1287.12] maybe you kissed somebody maybe you just
[1284.64 - 1289.52] caught it somewhere somehow on a public
[1287.12 - 1291.68] toilet seat but you have it in you and
[1289.52 - 1294.60] it's feasting on gluten and that was
[1291.68 - 1296.32] never a problem before before instead
[1294.60 - 1298.48] now you're like wait a minute
[1296.32 - 1300.56] something's wrong I feel a little bit
[1298.48 - 1302.80] better getting off of gluten am I one of
[1300.56 - 1305.16] those people now where I have to be off
[1302.80 - 1307.36] of gluten and yeah you have to be off of
[1305.16 - 1310.52] gluten and maybe you're somebody that
[1307.36 - 1312.88] does great with eggs can eat eggs every
[1310.52 - 1314.72] day two eggs every single day could have
[1312.88 - 1317.04] them boiled fried you could have them on
[1314.72 - 1319.12] your salads you can have them scrambled
[1317.04 - 1321.24] you can have any form of egg you can
[1319.12 - 1323.96] have it in bread you can have it
[1321.24 - 1326.32] anywhere anyhow you do good with eggs
[1323.96 - 1328.40] you've been eating them for years and
[1326.32 - 1330.36] then you're getting sick and sick and
[1328.40 - 1333.72] sicker because you caught a bug maybe
[1330.36 - 1335.60] you caught an Epstein bar virus maybe
[1333.72 - 1337.80] it's your Epstein bar virus that
[1335.60 - 1340.56] suddenly was awakened because your
[1337.80 - 1343.08] immune system just broke down and some
[1340.56 - 1345.84] triggers occurred and other exposures
[1343.08 - 1348.24] and then boom immune system weakened and
[1345.84 - 1351.12] then an Epstein bar came out of a dormy
[1348.24 - 1354.00] that's been there forever and as it gets
[1351.12 - 1356.48] up and strong and grows it's feeding off
[1354.00 - 1358.64] those eggs for the first time in all
[1356.48 - 1360.84] these years and something starts to
[1358.64 - 1363.52] change and then you're in a public
[1360.84 - 1365.88] bathroom you sit on a toilet seat you
[1363.52 - 1368.72] actually eliminate in the toilet the
[1365.88 - 1371.28] splash goes right up into the rectum and
[1368.72 - 1375.24] in that Splash was a different Epstein
[1371.28 - 1377.24] bar virus got into you it's now in you
[1375.24 - 1379.88] it's not going to leave you it's going
[1377.24 - 1381.44] to percolate it's going to do its thing
[1379.88 - 1384.52] and you start getting sick and that
[1381.44 - 1389.04] Epstein bar virus had a different diet
[1384.52 - 1391.84] it loved dairy products milk cheese and
[1389.04 - 1394.32] butter and that Epstein bar virus that
[1391.84 - 1396.88] was in another person that was eating a
[1394.32 - 1399.72] lot of milk cheese and butter wasn't
[1396.88 - 1401.96] used to or eating goat's milk or goat's
[1399.72 - 1404.08] cheese and that person that has this
[1401.96 - 1407.32] virus now that's feeding off of milk
[1404.08 - 1409.32] cheese and butter is shying away over
[1407.32 - 1411.88] time from milk cheese and butter and
[1409.32 - 1413.56] starting to gravitate to other options
[1411.88 - 1415.48] because they're hearing people say well
[1413.56 - 1417.28] if you don't feel good get off the milk
[1415.48 - 1420.00] get off the dairy and you should try
[1417.28 - 1422.36] goats milk or goats cheese and they end
[1420.00 - 1424.52] up feeling a little bit better they do
[1422.36 - 1426.52] okay and they're like wo I like goat
[1424.52 - 1428.76] cheese that's what I eat and that's what
[1426.52 - 1431.92] I like and I seem to do better with it
[1428.76 - 1435.40] until that epine bar over time says I'm
[1431.92 - 1437.96] hungry and I need some Dairy so it
[1435.40 - 1440.48] starts to actually go towards the goat
[1437.96 - 1442.68] cheese and the goat milk and then you're
[1440.48 - 1444.96] somebody with a shingles virus maybe it
[1442.68 - 1446.96] was dormant for years maybe you picked
[1444.96 - 1449.12] up a shingles virus very easily from
[1446.96 - 1452.64] somebody else somehow and that shingles
[1449.12 - 1455.08] virus had a diet in somebody else that
[1452.64 - 1457.76] was actually eggs somebody else ate a
[1455.08 - 1460.08] lot of eggs they had a shingles flare up
[1457.76 - 1462.44] continuously they had maybe multiple
[1460.08 - 1464.44] shingles viruses and those shingles
[1462.44 - 1467.92] viruses were used to eating eggs for a
[1464.44 - 1469.72] long time and maybe you ate eggs and
[1467.92 - 1473.00] everything was fine but this other
[1469.72 - 1474.88] person they got away from eggs they got
[1473.00 - 1476.64] away from other things too because they
[1474.88 - 1478.36] were kind of figuring out whoo this
[1476.64 - 1480.72] doesn't work for me this does work for
[1478.36 - 1482.64] me because they were so inflamed for so
[1480.72 - 1484.40] long with these shingles viruses but
[1482.64 - 1486.28] you've been eating eggs all this time
[1484.40 - 1488.72] and you've been doing okay with them and
[1486.28 - 1490.68] you feel confident that the eggs work
[1488.72 - 1493.72] for you and then you get this new
[1490.68 - 1497.92] shingles virus it's in you now and it's
[1493.72 - 1501.08] feeding on the eggs same goes with soy
[1497.92 - 1503.76] soy can feed pathogens too genetically
[1501.08 - 1506.20] altered soy can actually feed some
[1503.76 - 1507.72] pathogens so if somebody's loaded with
[1506.20 - 1509.76] some kind of pathogen and they're eating
[1507.72 - 1511.52] a lot of soy same thing can happen or
[1509.76 - 1515.96] they get a pathogen from somebody else
[1511.52 - 1518.20] who ate a lot of soy GMO soy and then
[1515.96 - 1520.16] boom they were eating soy too that
[1518.20 - 1521.96] pathogen's like whoa this is the food I
[1520.16 - 1523.72] like this is the food I want and when
[1521.96 - 1525.92] someone gets extra inflamed out of
[1523.72 - 1527.80] nowhere because they're eating that soy
[1525.92 - 1529.64] if they could line it up and match it up
[1527.80 - 1531.16] cuz a lot of people can some people
[1529.64 - 1533.28] don't know what's bothering them they
[1531.16 - 1535.92] don't know what food's triggering them
[1533.28 - 1538.08] but some people do and they're like whoa
[1535.92 - 1539.48] I think I'm going to back down the soy
[1538.08 - 1540.96] for a while and now they're feeling a
[1539.48 - 1543.16] little bit better but what's really
[1540.96 - 1546.00] happening is they're starving the
[1543.16 - 1548.32] pathogen they're starving the virus
[1546.00 - 1551.28] medical medium information is about
[1548.32 - 1553.40] customizing a protocol for you taking
[1551.28 - 1556.04] your health as far as you want to go so
[1553.40 - 1558.48] when you learn that gluten feeds bugs
[1556.04 - 1561.84] say you got an H pylori say you have or
[1558.48 - 1564.40] two streps and they eat gluten and that
[1561.84 - 1566.56] gluten is feeding them creating
[1564.40 - 1569.52] inflammation then you could rid that
[1566.56 - 1573.08] gluten and see what happens and you're
[1569.52 - 1574.88] starving one or two varieties of bugs
[1573.08 - 1577.44] same thing if you take eggs out of your
[1574.88 - 1580.68] diet you're taking the eggs away from
[1577.44 - 1584.56] the pathogens viruses like shingles and
[1580.68 - 1587.56] Epstein bar love eggs so when you remove
[1584.56 - 1589.80] the eggs those bugs don't have a food
[1587.56 - 1592.04] that they love and eat every day
[1589.80 - 1594.84] essentially you're starving the bugs
[1592.04 - 1596.56] starving them out of your body they die
[1594.84 - 1598.16] if they don't have the food they need
[1596.56 - 1600.80] it's a great way of getting rid of so
[1598.16 - 1603.20] many bugs many people use the medical
[1600.80 - 1605.84] medum information to clean up all the
[1603.20 - 1608.08] pathogens they learn about the foods
[1605.84 - 1610.84] they get rid of the pathogens and then
[1608.08 - 1613.52] they bring those Foods back in the eggs
[1610.84 - 1614.80] or the gluten or dairy as time goes on
[1613.52 - 1616.32] and they notice that they're actually
[1614.80 - 1618.52] able to eat it they're not getting
[1616.32 - 1620.84] inflamed and they're okay but
[1618.52 - 1623.72] everybody's different so many people
[1620.84 - 1626.56] have different toxins poisons metals and
[1623.72 - 1628.72] different bugs and pathogens some people
[1626.56 - 1631.08] have two or three different viruses some
[1628.72 - 1633.48] people will have 10 different strains of
[1631.08 - 1635.08] viruses some people will have five
[1633.48 - 1636.84] different viruses or they'll have
[1635.08 - 1639.60] bacteria as well and there'll be
[1636.84 - 1642.68] different levels of bugs some aggressive
[1639.60 - 1644.76] some very mild so they have to customize
[1642.68 - 1646.20] protocol for what they need because
[1644.76 - 1648.40] they're different than somebody else
[1646.20 - 1650.60] who's sick they have the option of
[1648.40 - 1653.64] taking out one of the foods that feeds
[1650.60 - 1655.00] bugs or take all of them out the
[1653.64 - 1657.68] difference with medical medium

[1657.68 - 1661.80] that it's not one siiz fits-all it's one
