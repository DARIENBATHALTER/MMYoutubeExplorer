[0.36 - 4.04] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[2.44 - 5.92] listening to the medical medium radio
[4.04 - 9.04] show where each week I talk about the
[5.92 - 11.00] most advanced healing information and
[9.04 - 14.00] secrets about health much of which is
[11.00 - 16.64] not found anywhere else and is decades
[14.00 - 19.08] ahead of what's out there now as I've
[16.64 - 22.36] always said who is 10 or 20 30 years to
[19.08 - 25.08] wait for answers to their illnesses life
[22.36 - 27.96] is precious this is the only Health show
[25.08 - 29.48] out there today where the information
[27.96 - 31.68] here doesn't come from any interest
[29.48 - 34.88] groups medical funding with strings
[31.68 - 36.88] attached botched research research with
[34.88 - 39.20] the thumb put on the scale to make
[36.88 - 42.68] things turn out the way they need to be
[39.20 - 45.12] spun research spun information lobbyist
[42.68 - 47.16] internal Kickbacks persuaded belief
[45.12 - 49.88] systems because when we fall into a
[47.16 - 51.52] belief system it can't be broken so no
[49.88 - 53.64] matter what happens it's where someone
[51.52 - 55.56] forges ahead forges ahead and they don't
[53.64 - 57.88] open their minds for something else
[55.56 - 61.44] private panels of influencers and health
[57.88 - 62.60] field payoffs and trendy traps you don't
[61.44 - 65.52] think that stuff's out there in
[62.60 - 67.08] alternative medicine it's saturated it's
[65.52 - 69.36] something that spirit and I have had to
[67.08 - 72.80] deal with for years and years and years
[69.36 - 75.12] it's nobody's fault it's nobody's fault
[72.80 - 76.84] and meaning in the sense that people you
[75.12 - 78.52] know they pick up information you find
[76.84 - 80.72] on the internet and you find in other
[78.52 - 83.52] places whatever and and you know you
[80.72 - 85.76] think this information is what is going
[83.52 - 88.24] on out there and then it gets trendy or
[85.76 - 91.00] catchy and all these things happen but
[88.24 - 94.60] what happens is that
[91.00 - 97.44] information has been tampered with along
[94.60 - 99.76] the way all along the way starting from
[97.44 - 101.52] the very beginning and it just gets more
[99.76 - 103.56] tampered more tampered one way or
[101.52 - 106.12] another all the health information I
[103.56 - 109.40] share here comes from a pure untampered
[106.12 - 111.64] with Advanced Clean Source a higher
[109.40 - 114.44] source the spirit of compassion there's
[111.64 - 117.48] nothing more healing than compassion
[114.44 - 119.04] there's nothing more healing you know
[117.48 - 120.20] someone said to me the other day look I
[119.04 - 121.68] hear you got kind of like like a new
[120.20 - 123.04] opening in the show where you talk about
[121.68 - 125.76] where the information comes from and
[123.04 - 128.20] everything else why are you doing that
[125.76 - 130.04] and I said because some people who are
[128.20 - 132.16] new come on to the show meaning they
[130.04 - 134.08] they they log on to the show and they
[132.16 - 135.56] just think it's the same old stuff they
[134.08 - 137.48] don't even give it they don't even like
[135.56 - 139.16] really listen to it they think it's
[137.48 - 142.16] maybe the same old stuff that's going
[139.16 - 144.36] around now that every expert knows or or
[142.16 - 146.08] that experts you know created or experts
[144.36 - 148.04] know or something or science has to
[146.08 - 149.36] offer or whatever and then experts and
[148.04 - 151.88] they and they think it's that oh wait a
[149.36 - 154.28] minute and they don't realize they don't
[151.88 - 156.08] realize that the information here has
[154.28 - 158.12] been different all along going all the
[156.08 - 159.60] way back to our first show and it's
[158.12 - 161.68] always been like that including in the
[159.60 - 163.60] books and it's important to know it's
[161.68 - 164.80] not something that should just be you
[163.60 - 165.88] know and I was telling this person it's
[164.80 - 169.00] not something that should just be
[165.88 - 171.48] ignored because someone has to be aware
[169.00 - 174.12] of what's going on conventional medicine
[171.48 - 176.04] we all know a conventional medicine and
[174.12 - 178.04] chronic illness has so many problems I
[176.04 - 180.92] mean so many problems it's
[178.04 - 182.48] unbelievable and we know that that but
[180.92 - 185.60] alternative medicine has so many
[182.48 - 188.08] problems too with with chronic illness
[185.60 - 190.32] it's unbelievable and it's not the
[188.08 - 193.16] doctors you I have I I know so many
[190.32 - 195.56] doctors amazing people without them we
[193.16 - 198.24] can't live it's like that song Can't
[195.56 - 200.08] Live living without you or whatever that
[198.24 - 201.76] it's like you can't live without them
[200.08 - 202.92] because um there's so many life-saving
[201.76 - 204.88] things that are out there now and
[202.92 - 207.56] life-saving techniques and and
[204.88 - 210.56] life-saving Equipment being invented yes
[207.56 - 213.64] by science but chronic
[210.56 - 218.08] illness is a whole another place it's
[213.64 - 220.72] for some reason it's not it's not
[218.08 - 222.60] separated properly like for some reason
[220.72 - 225.24] there's serious medical Denial in
[222.60 - 226.96] conventional medicine and you know I
[225.24 - 228.48] mean even in summon alternative medicine
[226.96 - 230.52] thank God alternative medicine became
[228.48 - 232.64] more open to that that's the whole point
[230.52 - 234.92] yeah I got to tell you something if you
[232.64 - 236.96] go back in time just a little bit I hate
[234.92 - 239.04] giving everybody like this like history
[236.96 - 241.84] stuff but I can't help it it's
[239.04 - 244.44] interesting if you go back excuse me if
[241.84 - 245.28] you go back a little bit in time maybe
[244.44 - 248.68] the
[245.28 - 250.40] 80s and and you wouldn't believe how
[248.68 - 252.96] separated alternative and conventional
[250.40 - 255.84] was I can't even tell you look maybe
[252.96 - 257.24] some of you already know that out there
[255.84 - 259.44] maybe the younger people coming on
[257.24 - 261.48] listening logging on to the show they
[259.44 - 264.84] don't know this they they they they
[261.48 - 268.20] think that it's always been kind of
[264.84 - 270.00] functionally put together where you go
[268.20 - 271.60] to your functional doctor you go to a
[270.00 - 272.96] clinic that has alternative and
[271.60 - 275.72] conventional and they're both working
[272.96 - 279.04] side by side that didn't
[275.72 - 282.64] exist um alternative medicine was the
[279.04 - 285.32] enemy the enemy to Conventional medicine
[282.64 - 289.00] the hatred was
[285.32 - 291.44] unbelievable it was a war it was a war
[289.00 - 294.28] it's no joke conventional
[291.44 - 297.32] doctors they I mean literally would
[294.28 - 299.24] dispel the slightest remedy you walk
[297.32 - 300.80] into a drugstore Pharmacy you wouldn't
[299.24 - 303.60] find real vitamins there you wouldn't
[300.80 - 306.24] find eona golden seal you wouldn't find
[303.60 - 308.16] anything there it didn't exist and if
[306.24 - 312.04] you ask the pharmacist about and say hey
[308.16 - 313.48] I heard golden seal is really helpful
[312.04 - 315.52] for something if you did that where's
[313.48 - 319.28] the golden seal they look at you like
[315.52 - 322.28] you had 10 heads on and you know so the
[319.28 - 324.28] deal is here that the things you know
[322.28 - 326.52] times have changed but what turned
[324.28 - 328.88] alternative medicine into something was
[326.52 - 330.76] that millions of people with chronic
[328.88 - 334.96] illness chronic
[330.76 - 337.64] illness with no answers were so fed up
[334.96 - 339.68] so fed up with going to their doctor
[337.64 - 341.68] being told they're insane being told
[339.68 - 344.00] they're lazy be being told there's
[341.68 - 347.32] something wrong I mean with them
[344.00 - 350.12] emotionally mentally and that their
[347.32 - 352.24] symptoms were in their head and you know
[350.12 - 354.84] it was a really hard time and still is
[352.24 - 356.16] now today I talk about some of that that
[354.84 - 358.40] I've never talked about actually before
[356.16 - 360.12] in the other books in the thyroid book
[358.40 - 362.72] and so
[360.12 - 363.92] conventional medicine was this place
[362.72 - 367.76] where when it came down to Chronic
[363.92 - 370.68] mystery illness forget it forget it and
[367.76 - 372.68] so you know hey the door was open it was
[370.68 - 374.28] open right at the beginning of the 80s
[372.68 - 376.20] right there late' 70s early ' 80s it's
[374.28 - 379.52] when alternative medicine was actually
[376.20 - 382.76] when people were filing in women mostly
[379.52 - 385.52] were filing into offices naturopaths the
[382.76 - 388.08] first naturopath in California the very
[385.52 - 389.72] first and other naturopaths that came
[388.08 - 391.88] after that and you know on the east
[389.72 - 394.04] coast and you couldn't find a naturopath
[391.88 - 395.00] in the in the uh middle of the country
[394.04 - 396.52] in the middle of the country you
[395.00 - 398.56] couldn't find you just couldn't find
[396.52 - 400.04] them you couldn't find a herbalist in
[398.56 - 402.00] the middle of the country I mean good
[400.04 - 405.24] luck in that time time period it's
[402.00 - 407.64] really a hard time that was happening
[405.24 - 410.56] and you know so what happened was people
[407.64 - 412.44] were filing in and the only answer
[410.56 - 414.36] really alternative medicine had back in
[412.44 - 416.36] 1980 for anybody with any mystery
[414.36 - 418.28] symptom is it's it's your it's candida
[416.36 - 420.68] it's candida it's candida that's all it
[418.28 - 422.60] was candida Candida candid God bless
[420.68 - 425.68] them I mean they were wrong but God
[422.60 - 430.16] bless them you know because it gave
[425.68 - 433.60] something it gave an answer to some
[430.16 - 435.84] degree to what to to anything to
[433.60 - 439.16] anything to knowing to knowing that
[435.84 - 441.20] there's something else going on there's
[439.16 - 443.52] something else going on that they're not
[441.20 - 447.60] crazy that all these women are not
[443.52 - 449.96] insane that they actually have some
[447.60 - 452.36] symptoms and something's wrong and you
[449.96 - 455.12] just can't be throwing antibiotics at
[452.36 - 457.68] them 24/7 and steroids because that's
[455.12 - 459.24] it's still all we have today and
[457.68 - 461.48] conventional medicine to deal with
[459.24 - 463.00] something that's critical or something
[461.48 - 464.44] that's you know coming you know out a
[463.00 - 467.36] little bit out of control whatever it is
[464.44 - 469.12] just antibiotics and steroids oh
[467.36 - 471.32] immunosuppressive drugs which is kind of
[469.12 - 472.88] you know almost many of them are in the
[471.32 - 474.68] steroid category or whatever but it's
[472.88 - 477.76] just it's a combination it's like
[474.68 - 479.80] biologics or Amun suppressives or now
[477.76 - 483.48] you know steroids and any biotics that's
[479.80 - 485.64] all we got and so women were getting
[483.48 - 488.72] answers it was
[485.64 - 490.52] candida and you know and yeah that's the
[488.72 - 492.32] candida that was the whole candida craze
[490.52 - 494.00] that started that's it took quite a
[492.32 - 496.72] while to catch on finally and get to the
[494.00 - 498.00] '90s and then finally get to then
[496.72 - 501.20] everybody was getting diagnosed the
[498.00 - 503.08] candida left and right now you know it's
[501.20 - 506.08] sibo sibo that's the craze it's sibo
[503.08 - 507.68] it's sibo hey leaky gut leaky gut leaky
[506.08 - 509.44] gut that's a crazy which leaky gut's a
[507.68 - 511.28] whole big confusion we talked about that
[509.44 - 513.84] already in one of the shows I'll do more
[511.28 - 516.24] about that that's information is still
[513.84 - 519.72] off on that still off on sio we talked
[516.24 - 521.88] about that in the sibo show and candida
[519.72 - 523.84] especially candida because just just as
[521.88 - 525.04] a reminder we can't live without candida
[523.84 - 528.00] we're not saying we can't live without
[525.04 - 531.20] doctors we can't live without candida
[528.00 - 533.84] you die if you have no candida we die
[531.20 - 536.28] we're we're gone we're gone we don't
[533.84 - 540.48] live I mean we'll just
[536.28 - 542.96] literally we won't be living like you
[540.48 - 544.40] and I'm serious about that you have
[542.96 - 546.68] first of all you can't get rid of all
[544.40 - 547.92] your candid it's impossible no matter
[546.68 - 552.04] how many cleanses and everything else
[547.92 - 554.56] you do thank God thank God CU if you did
[552.04 - 556.92] get rid of all your candida You' die
[554.56 - 559.76] okay because that's that's what keeps us
[556.92 - 561.68] alive that's a neutral fungus that does
[559.76 - 563.44] all kinds of Miracles for us internally
[561.68 - 565.16] and when it grows out of control that's
[563.44 - 567.56] because something it's actually helping
[565.16 - 569.60] you it's cleaning up a mess another
[567.56 - 571.20] problem so that's a whole thing and you
[569.60 - 573.20] won't find that information anywhere and
[571.20 - 575.72] if you do it's because I I put that out
[573.20 - 577.44] there and that's what I mean and it's
[575.72 - 578.68] not about me being smart it's about the
[577.44 - 581.12] information coming from that clean
[578.68 - 583.80] Source spirit and and that's that's you
[581.12 - 586.88] know that's what it's about and and the
[583.80 - 589.16] deal is is that you know people were
[586.88 - 590.92] pouring in being told that they had
[589.16 - 593.08] candida and the conventional doctors
[590.92 - 595.20] were like they were like that's in
[593.08 - 598.12] that's insane conventional doctors were
[595.20 - 600.56] like you know whatever this craze is but
[598.12 - 602.96] women were being hurt heard and it was
[600.56 - 604.12] so important you know we talk about all
[602.96 - 605.64] these different things women's rights
[604.12 - 608.36] and all these different ways but in
[605.64 - 610.16] chronic illness oh my God it's been
[608.36 - 613.64] terrifying
[610.16 - 615.88] terrifying and so it's better now but
[613.64 - 617.56] the problem is now that every single
[615.88 - 619.20] person who has a symptom and who gets
[617.56 - 621.00] sick gets diagnosed with Lyme disease
[619.20 - 622.92] whether they like it or not and that's a
[621.00 - 625.64] tragedy all all on its own absolute
[622.92 - 628.04] tragedy and you can't it's hard to argue
[625.64 - 630.68] it's hard to argue and even if even if
[628.04 - 633.20] the information I talk about is 100%
[630.68 - 635.08] right on to what's really going on it's
[633.20 - 637.80] impossible to battle it out there it's
[635.08 - 640.80] almost impossible because it's just it's
[637.80 - 642.80] it's so ingrained it's been bred into
[640.80 - 644.88] our psyche through our pets to begin
[642.80 - 647.00] with with Lyme disease and then and then
[644.88 - 649.44] through us it's been
[647.00 - 650.96] unbelievable of what's going on so every
[649.44 - 653.64] single I I'll tell you I'll give you a
[650.96 - 656.12] prediction right now 10 more years 15
[653.64 - 659.28] more years everybody's going to have
[656.12 - 660.40] Lyme disease that has a symptom or not
[659.28 - 662.24] just going to the doctor and getting
[660.40 - 665.36] some blood tests because there's there's
[662.24 - 668.56] something totally 100% corrupted in the
[665.36 - 670.16] system of medicine today alternatively
[668.56 - 673.40] that's allowing for these Lyme disease
[670.16 - 675.60] diagnoses to get out of control to this
[673.40 - 677.04] degree if you just logged on and you
[675.60 - 679.32] don't understand like meaning you're
[677.04 - 682.16] you're like what's he talking about
[679.32 - 684.24] what's he saying you know get book one
[682.16 - 686.36] and read the lime chapter to begin with
[684.24 - 687.28] just so you can get familiar with what's
[686.36 - 690.40] really
[687.28 - 692.04] happening and and I'm talking about this
[690.40 - 694.24] because it starts like I said the
[692.04 - 696.56] conventional here's okay here's the deal
[694.24 - 699.16] so conventional and alternative medicine
[696.56 - 702.48] they were separated they were separated
[699.16 - 704.28] far apart they came together there's
[702.48 - 706.12] some good things there's some bad things
[704.28 - 708.56] there's some good bad and ugly about
[706.12 - 711.28] that okay some good things are is thank
[708.56 - 714.28] God we're all working together some bad
[711.28 - 716.68] things are it's really brought in
[714.28 - 717.96] exactly the Lyme disease craz now like
[716.68 - 720.88] that was
[717.96 - 722.60] conventional that was conventional
[720.88 - 724.44] believe it or not even though you don't
[722.60 - 726.00] think it was because conventional
[724.44 - 729.24] doctors would ignore lime they would
[726.00 - 731.96] ignore it no it was conventional it was
[729.24 - 734.32] and it was conventionally founded and
[731.96 - 736.52] conventional doctors didn't accept it so
[734.32 - 739.92] it it made a confusion where wait a
[736.52 - 742.76] minute maybe alternative medicine is is
[739.92 - 745.76] responding to to Lyme disease more than
[742.76 - 747.40] ever before so that's where and then but
[745.76 - 749.88] really what happened was it was
[747.40 - 751.72] conventionally founded
[749.88 - 754.32] and then it was and then the
[751.72 - 756.88] conventional you know doctors actually
[754.32 - 760.12] the the medical system ignored it that
[756.88 - 761.88] was a game that was a game that was a
[760.12 - 764.08] game to rope everybody in to get the
[761.88 - 766.16] confusion twisted and swirling out there
[764.08 - 768.16] so that conventional alternative would
[766.16 - 770.44] finally come together in the end to
[768.16 - 772.20] where we are now and there's going to be
[770.44 - 775.88] the Lyme disease craze like you've never
[772.20 - 779.96] seen before in history ever in history
[775.88 - 784.28] just 10 more years you won't believe
[779.96 - 787.20] what you're going to see and how off it
[784.28 - 789.24] really is unless we do something about
[787.20 - 792.12] it and get real answers and do things
[789.24 - 794.40] the way we need to do it but
[792.12 - 796.92] conventional and alternative medicine
[794.40 - 799.40] came together now you can get it in one
[796.92 - 801.68] package and there's good things about
[799.40 - 803.12] that really incredible things about it
[801.68 - 806.88] because alternative medicine offers so
[803.12 - 809.40] many great things incredible things and
[806.88 - 812.76] um and the support and it has The
[809.40 - 814.60] Compassion there's more compassion in it
[812.76 - 817.56] you know nowadays than even there was
[814.60 - 819.40] before and in and and it and it forces
[817.56 - 821.52] the conventional model to have more
[819.40 - 824.28] compassion than ever did before so
[821.52 - 827.44] there's some beautiful wonderful things
[824.28 - 830.84] that have occurred from having them join
[827.44 - 833.48] together you know great things and then
[830.84 - 836.40] you there's been more more opportunities
[833.48 - 839.96] for both sides to to you know glean from
[836.40 - 841.96] each other as well and that's been some
[839.96 - 843.88] of the good things there's there's also
[841.96 - 845.32] other bad things too but why why am I
[843.88 - 846.64] kind of talking about the history a
[845.32 - 849.12] little bit and where we're at now cuz
[846.64 - 852.56] when it comes down to lupus which we're
[849.12 - 854.88] going to get to that is one massive
[852.56 - 856.24] confusion that's one massive confusion
[854.88 - 858.68] and the reason why I'm even talking
[856.24 - 861.60] about lime is because every single
[858.68 - 863.68] person with lupus will be diagnosed with
[861.60 - 866.84] lime even though they don't really have
[863.68 - 868.40] it I'm just for warning just forewarning
[866.84 - 870.92] you if you're a practitioner listening
[868.40 - 872.08] to I'm just just just giving you the you
[870.92 - 875.20] know the
[872.08 - 877.12] 411 that's just everybody with lupus is
[875.20 - 880.60] going to be going to a lime doctor filed
[877.12 - 883.92] into the lime trap every single one
[880.60 - 885.80] eventually and there's there's going to
[883.92 - 888.84] be something strange happening coming in
[885.80 - 889.92] the next 10 years lupus diagnoses are
[888.84 - 891.92] going to be
[889.92 - 895.84] less they're going to be less even
[891.92 - 897.56] though there's more people with symptoms
[895.84 - 899.44] mystery symptoms that would have been
[897.56 - 901.68] identified as lupus
[899.44 - 903.88] originally but there's going to be less
[901.68 - 907.36] diagnosis multiple
[903.88 - 910.28] sclerosis um patients people with MS
[907.36 - 912.24] symptoms are going to be getting more
[910.28 - 915.52] symptoms meaning more and more people
[912.24 - 917.72] getting new found symptoms and of of Ms
[915.52 - 921.36] but they're going to be diagnosed less
[917.72 - 924.84] with Ms do you see because they're all
[921.36 - 928.12] going to be funneled to the lime machine
[924.84 - 932.20] the lime machine a trillion doll coming
[928.12 - 933.72] up business the lime lime machine and um
[932.20 - 935.12] and every every time you see a tick
[933.72 - 937.32] you're just going to you're just you're
[935.12 - 939.40] going to lose your breath
[937.32 - 941.64] you you know and that's what's going to
[939.40 - 942.68] happen and and the reason why I'm
[941.64 - 944.40] talking about this is because we're
[942.68 - 945.88] talking about lupus but it's lupus is
[944.40 - 947.28] going to be outdated the diagnosis
[945.88 - 948.48] itself is going to be outdated even
[947.28 - 952.16] people who have been carrying that
[948.48 - 955.72] diagnosis for 10 years already 15 years
[952.16 - 959.28] they're going to be forced forced to
[955.72 - 961.52] believe they have something else
[959.28 - 963.40] even though lupus in itself is confusion
[961.52 - 965.00] to begin with the diagnoses everything
[963.40 - 967.00] about it's a mystery doctors don't even
[965.00 - 970.12] know what really is lupus is it even
[967.00 - 974.56] something at all even with all that it's
[970.12 - 976.60] going to be less less and less of a
[974.56 - 979.24] diagnosis and people who have already
[976.60 - 982.16] had long-standing long-term lupus
[979.24 - 983.76] identified in their medical records
[982.16 - 985.44] they're going to be going to doctors and
[983.76 - 987.08] doctors can be a look I just did a lime
[985.44 - 988.60] test on you you got lime now maybe
[987.08 - 992.00] that's what this has been the whole
[988.60 - 995.00] whole time it's been lime this whole
[992.00 - 996.56] time it no one talks about this no one
[995.00 - 998.28] talks about the truth about anything
[996.56 - 1000.52] about this even you can alter medicine
[998.28 - 1004.12] listen to podcast or just no one's going
[1000.52 - 1006.32] to any of this it's it's it it it blows
[1004.12 - 1008.36] me away and maybe because they don't
[1006.32 - 1009.92] have spirit and I got to remember that I
[1008.36 - 1011.72] always have to remember that you know
[1009.92 - 1014.20] Spirit even reminds me once in a while
[1011.72 - 1015.72] and even even my family reminds me and
[1014.20 - 1018.64] like remember you know you're just you
[1015.72 - 1020.00] can't get all wound up because they they
[1018.64 - 1022.96] don't have Spirit talking to them
[1020.00 - 1025.00] telling them this so you can't get that
[1022.96 - 1026.88] charged up you can't get charged up of
[1025.00 - 1028.96] why everything's so slow and coming and
[1026.88 - 1030.20] why it always gets twisted and turns and
[1028.96 - 1032.08] goes in different in the wrong
[1030.20 - 1034.20] directions out there in alternative Inc
[1032.08 - 1036.52] conventional medicine
[1034.20 - 1037.88] and and then somebody else will say well
[1036.52 - 1039.80] you know that's crazy look what science
[1037.88 - 1043.28] has to offer absolutely and I love it
[1039.80 - 1044.72] I'm huge I'm a big science fan I'm a
[1043.28 - 1047.16] science fan because I love Spirit
[1044.72 - 1048.60] debunking it constantly it's fun that's
[1047.16 - 1049.92] one of the reasons why I'm a fan the
[1048.60 - 1052.36] other reason why is because a lot of
[1049.92 - 1054.36] science is really gr but even the
[1052.36 - 1055.88] mechanical stuff that's created by the
[1054.36 - 1057.40] technology that's created by science
[1055.88 - 1058.72] still there's problems everywhere look
[1057.40 - 1061.28] at the hernia
[1058.72 - 1062.96] mesh I mean look at the I mean it's just
[1061.28 - 1063.88] one blunder after another and these are
[1062.96 - 1065.84] things that have been weighed and
[1063.88 - 1068.16] measured science is about weighing and
[1065.84 - 1070.04] measuring you guys it's about weighing
[1068.16 - 1071.36] and measuring that's what science is you
[1070.04 - 1074.64] can't weit you can't measure it then
[1071.36 - 1076.48] it's just a theory which if there's the
[1074.64 - 1078.00] right funding in the right place then
[1076.48 - 1079.40] that theory will take off and be
[1078.00 - 1081.48] something they'll make that theory and
[1079.40 - 1083.40] turn that theory into something because
[1081.48 - 1085.52] it'll be funded and when people put
[1083.40 - 1087.44] money in oh you don't want to piss them
[1085.52 - 1089.60] off you don't want to piss off those
[1087.44 - 1091.20] people who put big money into things so
[1089.60 - 1092.72] you got to put your thumb on the scale
[1091.20 - 1094.36] and make that theory into something oh
[1092.72 - 1096.92] yeah no it did come out this okay let's
[1094.36 - 1099.56] do it this this did come out this way
[1096.92 - 1103.56] worry about the consequences later and
[1099.56 - 1105.88] so so but but science is about weighing
[1103.56 - 1107.32] and measuring it's about facts facts
[1105.88 - 1109.76] that have been weighed and measured
[1107.32 - 1111.92] perfectly and so there's things that we
[1109.76 - 1114.60] create in science technology and and
[1111.92 - 1116.64] physical things just they don't work out
[1114.60 - 1117.92] you got they just don't they were weight
[1116.64 - 1121.60] and measured they should have worked it
[1117.92 - 1125.44] but they didn't even that has holes in
[1121.60 - 1127.12] it why am I talking about all this again
[1125.44 - 1132.48] because when it comes down to lupus it's
[1127.12 - 1134.36] so so confusing and and it's a hard deal
[1132.48 - 1137.08] it's a hard deal the way lupus came
[1134.36 - 1139.28] about the way it was discovered the way
[1137.08 - 1141.04] you know the way people like okay you
[1139.28 - 1143.68] got rash you got fever we don't know
[1141.04 - 1146.16] what it is you got lupus whether tests
[1143.68 - 1149.40] show anything or they don't lupus has
[1146.16 - 1151.44] been a tough one so I'm letting you know
[1149.40 - 1152.64] it can't be weigh or measured lupus
[1151.44 - 1155.32] can't be weigh or
[1152.64 - 1157.80] measured it can't be weight or
[1155.32 - 1160.00] measured even lime disease can't be
[1157.80 - 1161.60] weight and measured it can't why do you
[1160.00 - 1164.56] think people get a borderline listen if
[1161.60 - 1166.24] you have a pathogen if you have say a
[1164.56 - 1167.76] bacteria that's causing Lyme disease
[1166.24 - 1168.92] it's either you have it or you're not or
[1167.76 - 1171.12] you don't
[1168.92 - 1174.04] so the best Labs the best newest labs in
[1171.12 - 1175.88] the country say oh it's borderline it it
[1174.04 - 1177.96] could be there it might not be there no
[1175.88 - 1180.92] no if you have a
[1177.96 - 1184.08] pathogen it's there or it's
[1180.92 - 1185.36] not that's one of the greatest mistakes
[1184.08 - 1186.48] they're going to change that cuz that's
[1185.36 - 1190.16] a that's a
[1186.48 - 1191.84] flaw that that is showing something's
[1190.16 - 1193.40] wrong with the whole lime testing to
[1191.84 - 1194.96] begin with and that's going to change
[1193.40 - 1197.24] watch I guarantee you doctors won't be
[1194.96 - 1200.68] getting tests coming back borderline
[1197.24 - 1202.16] anymore because that's a massive mess up
[1200.68 - 1203.68] all on its own that's happening they're
[1202.16 - 1205.20] going to fix that they're going to fix
[1203.68 - 1207.68] that because they know that that was
[1205.20 - 1209.76] they shouldn't be saying that and you
[1207.68 - 1211.48] know the thing is you know so weight and
[1209.76 - 1213.36] measured lupus can't be weight and
[1211.48 - 1214.04] measured chronic illness can't be weight
[1213.36 - 1219.20] and
[1214.04 - 1221.24] measured it can't be it can't be and so
[1219.20 - 1224.00] this is this is where chronic
[1221.24 - 1227.16] illness has to be separated and
[1224.00 - 1230.40] respected it has to be respected and
[1227.16 - 1233.44] separated from all the nonsense it
[1230.40 - 1235.80] really does and it has to be it it
[1233.44 - 1239.04] really something has to change and
[1235.80 - 1241.36] that's what the shows about and uh and
[1239.04 - 1243.80] the the decades and decades that put
[1241.36 - 1246.60] into uh helping people and everything
[1243.80 - 1248.88] else around it you know check out the
[1246.60 - 1251.44] Instagram medical medium Instagram
[1248.88 - 1253.96] because it's just it's so inspiring it
[1251.44 - 1256.20] just constantly inspires me everybody
[1253.96 - 1257.76] telling their stories of what they go
[1256.20 - 1259.40] through what what's happening what
[1257.76 - 1260.56] meaning their healing process what
[1259.40 - 1263.68] they've been through and how they're
[1260.56 - 1267.48] healing I it's it's incredible to watch
[1263.68 - 1269.84] somebody reminded me recently a mom and
[1267.48 - 1272.60] their child and and she said on
[1269.84 - 1275.24] Instagram she said you know the all
[1272.60 - 1277.92] storms pass everything changes and
[1275.24 - 1281.60] nothing stays the same really helped her
[1277.92 - 1284.12] to get through a hard time and in in
[1281.60 - 1287.72] spirit you know Spirit gave me that a
[1284.12 - 1290.04] long time ago all storms pass everything
[1287.72 - 1291.68] Chang ches and nothing stays the same I
[1290.04 - 1294.32] want to just talk about it for one
[1291.68 - 1296.56] minute a couple minutes what does that
[1294.32 - 1298.44] mean what is that about first of all
[1296.56 - 1299.88] storms meaning whether it's a Health
[1298.44 - 1302.44] crisis whether something's happening in
[1299.88 - 1303.72] your family whether something's going on
[1302.44 - 1305.80] whether you got stress whether it's
[1303.72 - 1307.96] Financial terrible financial problems
[1305.80 - 1309.36] whatever it is whatever is going on in
[1307.96 - 1312.40] your life it's a
[1309.36 - 1315.04] storm if you're sick it's a
[1312.40 - 1317.28] storm and there's something to
[1315.04 - 1319.76] understand that Spirit taught me doesn't
[1317.28 - 1320.56] matter if the storm going on for 5 years
[1319.76 - 1325.16] 5
[1320.56 - 1326.80] minutes 5 months 10 years it doesn't
[1325.16 - 1330.04] matter how
[1326.80 - 1332.68] long everything changes and nothing
[1330.04 - 1334.96] stays the same it will change it will
[1332.68 - 1336.80] pass this is something that can bring
[1334.96 - 1339.12] you peace no matter what's happening in
[1336.80 - 1341.56] your life it's brought me peace if I've
[1339.12 - 1344.48] ever come across a storm because storms
[1341.56 - 1347.00] don't Define us you have to know that
[1344.48 - 1348.52] they don't Define who we are the storm
[1347.00 - 1350.32] is not you
[1348.52 - 1353.80] the storm is not
[1350.32 - 1355.68] you that's what I'm saying the storm is
[1353.80 - 1358.72] not you even if you're sick because
[1355.68 - 1360.92] guess what if you're sick it's not your
[1358.72 - 1363.24] fault it's not your fault you're sick
[1360.92 - 1364.60] you didn't create it's not because
[1363.24 - 1366.80] you're faulty it's not because you have
[1364.60 - 1369.60] bad genes it's not because you're a bad
[1366.80 - 1371.24] person that's that's not why you're
[1369.60 - 1372.84] struggling with some kind of illness
[1371.24 - 1375.36] something happened something happened
[1372.84 - 1377.48] that medical science and research hasn't
[1375.36 - 1379.12] figured out that's what I'm saying it
[1377.48 - 1382.60] can't be weighted measured in chronic
[1379.12 - 1382.60] illness that's not your
[1382.92 - 1389.80] fault did anybody um listen to the uh
[1386.44 - 1391.60] autoimmune autoimmune webinar I just did
[1389.80 - 1393.48] I talked a little bit about that in the
[1391.60 - 1395.24] webinar there's some webinars coming up
[1393.48 - 1397.36] and you got to catch them you got to
[1395.24 - 1400.88] catch them there's a few more
[1397.36 - 1403.84] webinars um so all storms pass whether
[1400.88 - 1407.12] we're going through hard times
[1403.84 - 1408.92] hardships and whatever that is doesn't
[1407.12 - 1411.16] matter what it is somebody's trying to
[1408.92 - 1413.16] you know throw judgment on you so
[1411.16 - 1414.80] whatever they're trying to do someone's
[1413.16 - 1419.04] bullying you whatever is happening
[1414.80 - 1421.80] everything changes and nothing stays the
[1419.04 - 1425.32] same and you always have to remember
[1421.80 - 1427.84] that and that storm isn't you it's not
[1425.32 - 1428.68] you so if you're having a problem with a
[1427.84 - 1432.96] a
[1428.68 - 1436.80] coworker or or colleague or you can't
[1432.96 - 1438.44] find work or whatever it is that's not
[1436.80 - 1441.16] what defines you
[1438.44 - 1442.64] it's not if you're sick it's not either
[1441.16 - 1444.12] and and when we're sick we're always
[1442.64 - 1446.16] it's always blamed on you it's always
[1444.12 - 1447.96] blamed on you blamed on us we're sick
[1446.16 - 1449.88] that's St you you you're obvious not
[1447.96 - 1451.40] doing something right you're obviously
[1449.88 - 1453.16] not doing something or you just got bad
[1451.40 - 1454.96] genes if there's no answers you know or
[1453.16 - 1456.84] you're just you know or it's autoimmune
[1454.96 - 1459.12] your body's attacking itself oh my God
[1456.84 - 1462.68] if I hear that one more time out there
[1459.12 - 1464.96] and so so when we have these storms and
[1462.68 - 1468.64] we have mystery
[1464.96 - 1470.76] lupus it's not what defines you okay
[1468.64 - 1472.52] it's not who you are something's
[1470.76 - 1474.52] happening we're going to talk about it
[1472.52 - 1476.16] and we've we've already probably talked
[1474.52 - 1479.32] about it I know we talked about in book
[1476.16 - 1481.00] one a little bit where lupus comes from
[1479.32 - 1482.60] I'm sure some of you are like oh yeah I
[1481.00 - 1485.12] know where it is I know what it is where
[1482.60 - 1488.32] it is in the book and the whole bit but
[1485.12 - 1491.40] this is important to just understand
[1488.32 - 1494.08] though about how it works it can't be
[1491.40 - 1497.00] waiter measured it's a
[1494.08 - 1498.40] storm and it's not you it's not your
[1497.00 - 1501.60] fault that's just like that with
[1498.40 - 1503.40] anything going on anyway the person that
[1501.60 - 1504.68] reminded me if you go to Instagram and
[1503.40 - 1507.12] you you you search through and
[1504.68 - 1510.28] everything like that the mom that
[1507.12 - 1513.16] reminded me about all storms pass um
[1510.28 - 1515.88] things got better for her
[1513.16 - 1518.00] child got better for her child and and
[1515.88 - 1520.20] better for her and they're moving
[1518.00 - 1522.36] they're moving past the storm like never
[1520.20 - 1525.64] before and so it's just something to
[1522.36 - 1528.96] think about it's something to think
[1525.64 - 1530.36] about so um so let's talk about lupus
[1528.96 - 1531.56] that's what it's about we're trying you
[1530.36 - 1533.00] know I'm giving you this whole the
[1531.56 - 1534.40] reason why this whole monologue is
[1533.00 - 1536.60] happening right at the beginning this
[1534.40 - 1539.92] really long monologue which you know
[1536.60 - 1542.36] whatever is happening is because I'm
[1539.92 - 1543.96] trying to prepare you because these are
[1542.36 - 1546.08] the things going on especially with
[1543.96 - 1547.72] someone with lupus is they get filed
[1546.08 - 1549.80] into lime the lime trap like I talked
[1547.72 - 1551.48] about earlier there there's going to be
[1549.80 - 1553.68] less lupus diagnoses because everybody's
[1551.48 - 1555.12] just going to put everybody into lime no
[1553.68 - 1557.96] matter what it is and we can just we
[1555.12 - 1560.52] could talk about all kinds of of of
[1557.96 - 1564.36] different autoimmune and illnesses and
[1560.52 - 1566.16] everything else so all right so lupus
[1564.36 - 1567.48] the whole bit let just let's run down
[1566.16 - 1570.68] some of the symptoms of
[1567.48 - 1572.12] Lupus fatigue right chronic fatigue
[1570.68 - 1574.72] depending on how serious somebody's
[1572.12 - 1577.80] lupus is could be uh mild fatigue on
[1574.72 - 1581.44] andof fatigue sometimes chronic joint
[1577.80 - 1583.96] pain could have fevers no fevers could
[1581.44 - 1588.52] be fevers for some people no fevers for
[1583.96 - 1589.84] others um uh joint pain joint swelling
[1588.52 - 1593.08] swelling
[1589.84 - 1594.84] edema so edema which means swelling
[1593.08 - 1596.68] ankles mysterious you know chronic
[1594.84 - 1600.88] illness is all mysterious swelling
[1596.68 - 1603.88] ankles swelling knees um fluid retention
[1600.88 - 1605.16] the whole bit um some of you probably
[1603.88 - 1607.40] like hey I got joint pain do I have
[1605.16 - 1609.84] Lupus that's how ridiculous it is
[1607.40 - 1612.32] because meaning not the pain not your
[1609.84 - 1613.96] symptom not what's going on there you
[1612.32 - 1615.64] totally validated that's not the problem
[1613.96 - 1617.20] but if you went to a lupus specialist
[1615.64 - 1619.28] yeah you'd probably get you know thrown
[1617.20 - 1620.76] into a lupus category it's possible but
[1619.28 - 1622.56] eventually like I said that's going to
[1620.76 - 1625.16] be outdated everybody's going into lime
[1622.56 - 1627.68] and don't get scared you don't have lime
[1625.16 - 1630.08] um swelling hair
[1627.68 - 1634.24] loss so that's another thing too that
[1630.08 - 1637.40] occurs hair loss Rod's phenomenon right
[1634.24 - 1639.04] Rod's phenomenon rod syndrome some
[1637.40 - 1641.16] people say in the whole bit that's the
[1639.04 - 1644.36] discoloration of the uh hands or the
[1641.16 - 1648.04] feet that whole thing uh rashes all over
[1644.36 - 1650.56] the body that could be lupus um give
[1648.04 - 1652.60] take um so these are some of the
[1650.56 - 1655.04] symptoms these are some of the symptoms
[1652.60 - 1656.92] let's cover these symptoms for a minute
[1655.04 - 1661.00] let's talk about him for a little
[1656.92 - 1664.08] bit um fatigue chronic fatigue that's
[1661.00 - 1666.40] Epstein bar that's Epstein bar because
[1664.08 - 1668.68] with with lupus you can get the white
[1666.40 - 1671.56] count could be off it could be up it
[1668.68 - 1672.64] could be down red red bullet cells down
[1671.56 - 1674.72] that could happen or they could be
[1672.64 - 1676.88] stabled and go down low platelets can
[1674.72 - 1678.52] occur you could you may not have low
[1676.88 - 1680.04] platelets May not have red blood cell
[1678.52 - 1682.44] problems with lopus but you have white
[1680.04 - 1684.56] blood cell issues it's all Epstein bar
[1682.44 - 1687.76] right there it's all viral infection
[1684.56 - 1690.48] viral infection to this day why aren't
[1687.76 - 1692.92] the best medical doctors saying you have
[1690.48 - 1695.76] a viral infection when you go to the
[1692.92 - 1697.64] doctor you have these symptoms that's
[1695.76 - 1699.68] what's supposed to be happening I'll
[1697.64 - 1703.52] tell you why it's not because something
[1699.68 - 1705.40] is just messed up in the system and it's
[1703.52 - 1708.08] been messed up in the system and it's
[1705.40 - 1710.44] not the doctor's fault it's not the
[1708.08 - 1712.84] awesome amazing doctor's fault who's
[1710.44 - 1714.80] dedicated their life to helping sick
[1712.84 - 1718.08] people it's not their fault but there's
[1714.80 - 1721.08] something terribly messed up in the
[1718.08 - 1723.00] system it's legit seriously messed up
[1721.08 - 1725.04] I'm serious for a long time now and
[1723.00 - 1728.20] still going and not
[1725.04 - 1730.92] stopping you walk into the doctor's
[1728.20 - 1734.28] office and you got
[1730.92 - 1738.28] fatigue and you got um
[1734.28 - 1739.72] swelling you got a viral infection
[1738.28 - 1741.08] you know I mean of course they can do
[1739.72 - 1742.48] all the weighing and measuring they can
[1741.08 - 1744.12] do some tests they can look for some
[1742.48 - 1745.76] weird thing that happened you know what
[1744.12 - 1747.16] happens too some people if they have a
[1745.76 - 1748.24] cancer they never knew about sitting
[1747.16 - 1750.84] inside of
[1748.24 - 1752.84] them that will be blamed on
[1750.84 - 1753.92] everything when it has nothing to do
[1752.84 - 1755.64] with the whole thing they're going
[1753.92 - 1757.60] through like nothing to do with the
[1755.64 - 1760.68] symptoms they're going through at all
[1757.60 - 1762.60] nothing to do with their fatigue at all
[1760.68 - 1764.52] but if they find something cancer oh
[1762.60 - 1766.32] this is this is it right here it's all
[1764.52 - 1770.40] this it's another mistake made
[1766.32 - 1772.60] constantly so um you know this this is
[1770.40 - 1775.48] this is how it works so joint pain
[1772.60 - 1777.36] fevers that are chronic up and down I
[1775.48 - 1779.36] mean you walk into a doctor's office it
[1777.36 - 1780.88] should be instant you got a viral
[1779.36 - 1784.88] infection it's like what happened with
[1780.88 - 1786.52] Lyme disease back in um uh 70 whatever
[1784.88 - 1788.08] 73 or whatever it was and I'm going to
[1786.52 - 1790.40] tell you now I'm going to tell you right
[1788.08 - 1794.04] now that right in the early '70s when
[1790.40 - 1797.48] people filed in the doctors knew it was
[1794.04 - 1799.28] viral they knew Lyme disease was viral
[1797.48 - 1803.32] they knew the symptoms that everybody
[1799.28 - 1806.92] was getting were 100% viral but there
[1803.32 - 1810.52] was a massive problem the problem was
[1806.92 - 1814.04] back in the 70s there weren't even
[1810.52 - 1816.76] antivirals to make money off of so there
[1814.04 - 1819.44] wasn't antivirals to make money off of
[1816.76 - 1821.16] viral mean we we got to throw our hands
[1819.44 - 1823.04] in the air and there's nothing to treat
[1821.16 - 1824.64] you there's no way to help you and
[1823.04 - 1828.32] that's just the bottom line because an
[1824.64 - 1830.72] antibiotic was not used at all back in
[1828.32 - 1832.16] the early 70s and when they noticed that
[1830.72 - 1833.96] they when they used it for somebody that
[1832.16 - 1836.88] walked in that had these these these
[1833.96 - 1838.32] crazy symptoms that were viral they knew
[1836.88 - 1840.52] that if they used it and they they did
[1838.32 - 1843.80] use it they got sicker which happens to
[1840.52 - 1846.68] 90% of the lime patients of today now
[1843.80 - 1848.76] remember this if you're one of the 10%
[1846.68 - 1852.44] it's that had some antibiotics and swear
[1848.76 - 1856.20] by them you know amazing but 90% think
[1852.44 - 1858.12] about 90 people out of a 100 people 90
[1856.20 - 1859.80] out of a 100 gets sicker from the
[1858.12 - 1861.80] antibiotic meaning their condition
[1859.80 - 1864.76] worsens they're worse off to where they
[1861.80 - 1866.32] started with their lime 90 out of 100
[1864.76 - 1868.44] just think about that line up a 100
[1866.32 - 1869.76] people 90 of them are going to become
[1868.44 - 1873.04] more worse
[1869.76 - 1877.72] off sure 10 may not or eight out of that
[1873.04 - 1880.12] 10 may not but 90 are is a problem is a
[1877.72 - 1882.84] massive problem and that's that's that's
[1880.12 - 1884.64] what you have to understand and and so
[1882.84 - 1887.64] back in the early '70s when they filed
[1884.64 - 1890.08] in with with the first symptoms on in in
[1887.64 - 1893.84] Connecticut and just so you know
[1890.08 - 1896.40] everywhere globally was happening at the
[1893.84 - 1899.16] same time globally at the same time it
[1896.40 - 1901.68] wasn't just Connecticut it was
[1899.16 - 1903.92] everywhere at the same time I talk about
[1901.68 - 1905.64] this in in in book one with the lime
[1903.92 - 1907.44] chapter so I don't want to go too deep
[1905.64 - 1910.16] into it all you can you can totally just
[1907.44 - 1911.96] get it from there but the bottom line is
[1910.16 - 1913.48] when they filed in they knew it was
[1911.96 - 1918.04] viral a viral
[1913.48 - 1920.96] infection amazing smart Physicians
[1918.04 - 1924.20] you know dedicated to helping people
[1920.96 - 1926.88] knew somehow some way that this was
[1924.20 - 1930.20] viral and and and that's incredible
[1926.88 - 1932.32] that's incredible but medicine it wasn't
[1930.20 - 1934.80] good for for big Pharma it wasn't good
[1932.32 - 1936.64] for the medical world because there's no
[1934.80 - 1938.48] way to treat it and make money off of it
[1936.64 - 1940.92] there's no way to treat it no way to
[1938.48 - 1943.28] make money off of it so it was a
[1940.92 - 1945.04] disaster it was a finan it was a it was
[1943.28 - 1947.60] it wasn't a financial
[1945.04 - 1949.60] gaining illness there were people filing
[1947.60 - 1952.16] in but there's no way to financially
[1949.60 - 1954.76] gain so that's where the bacterial thing
[1952.16 - 1957.00] had to come later I know people you know
[1954.76 - 1958.28] that are that know that they're really
[1957.00 - 1960.72] hung up on Lime right now they're
[1958.28 - 1963.68] probably just swearing at me and maybe
[1960.72 - 1965.60] even turning off the radio and uh just
[1963.68 - 1969.36] keep it on try to keep it on and hang in
[1965.60 - 1971.40] there and so when it what was bacterial
[1969.36 - 1973.68] deemed you were able to treat it and
[1971.40 - 1978.08] then and then the antibiotics became a
[1973.68 - 1980.84] massive a massive financial gain
[1978.08 - 1983.16] and we've suffered 30 I mean I've seen
[1980.84 - 1986.20] people 30 20 years ago whatever you name
[1983.16 - 1987.72] it even longer that if if their lives
[1986.20 - 1989.32] have been ruined and they put in
[1987.72 - 1992.36] wheelchairs because of the antibiotics
[1989.32 - 1995.36] but the point is is
[1992.36 - 1997.32] that anybody coming in they knew it was
[1995.36 - 2000.24] viral now the same thing should be
[1997.32 - 2002.68] happening now with any lupus stuff
[2000.24 - 2005.24] instead of the trend heading to they
[2002.68 - 2006.76] come in well I know you had lupus I know
[2005.24 - 2011.56] you've been diagnosed with lupus 4 years
[2006.76 - 2013.76] ago go ma'am I know that but we need to
[2011.56 - 2016.04] do a lime panel we got to send you to a
[2013.76 - 2017.92] lime Specialist or do a lime panel and
[2016.04 - 2019.96] you probably had that this whole time
[2017.92 - 2023.16] instead of it going there it should be
[2019.96 - 2025.92] like this is viral The Chronic fatigue
[2023.16 - 2027.84] the joint pain the on andof fevers the
[2025.92 - 2029.60] white blood cells being totally up and
[2027.84 - 2032.48] down which wherever where they want to
[2029.60 - 2034.16] go which lympocytes nutrifil basophils
[2032.48 - 2039.36] monocytes whatever it
[2034.16 - 2041.72] is um all this involved should be like
[2039.36 - 2046.16] hey this is viral that's what should be
[2041.72 - 2048.80] happening but it's not it's not it's not
[2046.16 - 2050.56] it's not it's a disaster and there
[2048.80 - 2052.08] nothing's getting fixed out there did I
[2050.56 - 2055.12] sound negative
[2052.08 - 2056.68] today sound negative today what have
[2055.12 - 2058.68] happened did I wake up on the wrong side
[2056.68 - 2061.48] of the bed so
[2058.68 - 2064.64] what all right here's the deal so um
[2061.48 - 2067.28] when you know with lupus and lupus
[2064.64 - 2070.76] symptoms those are viral symptoms the
[2067.28 - 2072.32] first thing we have to understand why is
[2070.76 - 2074.08] that important because in order to get
[2072.32 - 2076.08] better you have to know what's going on
[2074.08 - 2078.12] in order to get better you have to have
[2076.08 - 2080.16] you need a truth you need to know what's
[2078.12 - 2083.12] happening what's going
[2080.16 - 2085.20] on and it it's critical to know that
[2083.12 - 2088.52] rashes all over the body the lupus
[2085.20 - 2090.40] people with lupus have rashes those
[2088.52 - 2093.24] rashes that's viral those are viral
[2090.40 - 2097.92] rashes that was
[2093.24 - 2101.80] 101 that was um one 101 back in the
[2097.92 - 2103.96] early 1970s with Physicians rashes that
[2101.80 - 2108.24] H that are like you you know someone
[2103.96 - 2110.72] with lupus is 101 a viral
[2108.24 - 2114.32] infection chronic viral
[2110.72 - 2116.20] infection where did we go wrong so the
[2114.32 - 2119.16] early the Early
[2116.20 - 2121.08] doctors that you know took in early lime
[2119.16 - 2122.84] people the very first ones in early 7s
[2121.08 - 2125.60] they were brilliant
[2122.84 - 2127.36] brilliant but they got stifled that they
[2125.60 - 2130.88] were told to shut up
[2127.36 - 2132.48] they were told to shut up that's right
[2130.88 - 2134.08] they were told to shut up don't be
[2132.48 - 2136.76] telling everybody what they really don't
[2134.08 - 2139.08] be telling the truth cuz we we need to
[2136.76 - 2142.12] make money off this and that's where it
[2139.08 - 2145.76] went wrong it's the start anyway and
[2142.12 - 2147.68] then we were trained trained otherwise
[2145.76 - 2150.12] so now we're trained with lupus the
[2147.68 - 2152.28] body's attacking itself it's autoimmune
[2150.12 - 2153.60] you walk in you get a lupus diagnosis oh
[2152.28 - 2157.32] it's your fault your body's attacking
[2153.60 - 2160.76] itself how's that you see what it mean
[2157.32 - 2163.44] it's just it's just it's mindblowing
[2160.76 - 2165.40] yeah this stuff keeps me up at night you
[2163.44 - 2168.20] know I wake up and I'm like thinking
[2165.40 - 2170.60] about it like how do we change this what
[2168.20 - 2172.96] do we do and spirit's like we're going
[2170.60 - 2175.40] to put the books out and we're going to
[2172.96 - 2178.60] get people to learn we just have to I'm
[2175.40 - 2180.84] like okay all right and you know here's
[2178.60 - 2183.64] the deal so with
[2180.84 - 2185.16] lupus the body is not attacking itself
[2183.64 - 2186.44] bottom line so you're told the body's
[2185.16 - 2188.24] attacking itself it's not attacking
[2186.44 - 2189.72] itself it's not there's a virus there's
[2188.24 - 2191.48] a viral infection there's a virus
[2189.72 - 2192.64] attacking the body it's important to
[2191.48 - 2194.24] know that because your immune system
[2192.64 - 2196.56] will line up to that your immune system
[2194.24 - 2198.56] will line up to the thinking to actually
[2196.56 - 2199.88] The Knowing to your cells in the body
[2198.56 - 2201.32] that there's an Invader that needs to be
[2199.88 - 2202.96] kicked out of your body and that's what
[2201.32 - 2204.84] you're going to start doing kicking the
[2202.96 - 2208.08] crap out of it out of your body what's
[2204.84 - 2211.76] the Invader with lupus 100% Epstein bar
[2208.08 - 2213.68] Epstein bar 100% related it is what it
[2211.76 - 2215.44] is when someone walks into a doctor's
[2213.68 - 2216.88] office and they got the chronic fatigue
[2215.44 - 2218.36] and they got the unexplainable Jo joint
[2216.88 - 2220.20] pain and unexplainable everything else
[2218.36 - 2221.84] that goes along with it they should be
[2220.20 - 2224.36] like the doctor should be like we're
[2221.84 - 2225.84] doing Epstein bar panel and we're also
[2224.36 - 2227.48] not going to we're not going to stand
[2225.84 - 2230.40] for whatever that panel says because the
[2227.48 - 2233.08] Epstein bar panel is is still not a
[2230.40 - 2234.96] strong it's still not a strong test
[2233.08 - 2237.80] because there's so much confusion with
[2234.96 - 2239.52] it but it's Epstein bar is what it is if
[2237.80 - 2241.28] it shows like what happens is you'll get
[2239.52 - 2244.20] the Epstein bar test and be like well
[2241.28 - 2247.00] you had Epstein bar you had it at one
[2244.20 - 2248.88] time in your life but it's not what's
[2247.00 - 2251.40] causing the lupus symptoms now that's
[2248.88 - 2253.96] not true what happens is Epstein bar has
[2251.40 - 2256.52] different stages you get it first it
[2253.96 - 2258.64] goes away but it doesn't go away it goes
[2256.52 - 2260.60] away and it still causes problems it
[2258.64 - 2263.56] still causes problems to organs it still
[2260.60 - 2264.80] causes symptoms it causes toxins which
[2263.56 - 2267.72] are
[2264.80 - 2270.32] neurotoxins which identify to a lot of
[2267.72 - 2272.84] the chronic pain chronic nerve pain
[2270.32 - 2274.64] because of neurotoxins you don't need a
[2272.84 - 2276.88] blood test saying that it's present in
[2274.64 - 2278.84] the moment because it's not in the
[2276.88 - 2281.44] bloodstream the virus the Epstein bar is
[2278.84 - 2284.60] not sitting in the bloodstream it's in
[2281.44 - 2286.84] tissue it's in the liver it's in places
[2284.60 - 2289.56] in the body it's in the spleen they
[2286.84 - 2291.60] can't test for that that's what I mean
[2289.56 - 2293.84] science and research just can't even get
[2291.60 - 2297.04] up to the point of what to do for
[2293.84 - 2300.64] testing for viruses properly but lupus
[2297.04 - 2303.16] is the Epstein bar sits inside the liver
[2300.64 - 2304.48] releases a lot of dermatoxin which
[2303.16 - 2307.56] becomes the
[2304.48 - 2308.64] rashes the rashes these they're dermat
[2307.56 - 2311.36] toxic
[2308.64 - 2312.88] rashes it's a toxin the liver gets
[2311.36 - 2314.24] sluggish every lupus person has a
[2312.88 - 2316.44] sluggish liver the liver gets real
[2314.24 - 2319.36] sluggish the Epstein bar sits inside the
[2316.44 - 2321.72] liver it releases the poison the poison
[2319.36 - 2324.48] gets surface to the skin because it
[2321.72 - 2326.84] can't find its way out of the body easy
[2324.48 - 2329.36] because the liver is really sluggish and
[2326.84 - 2331.52] the lymphatic systems swelling with a
[2329.36 - 2333.44] lot of people with lupus so the toxins
[2331.52 - 2335.76] have nowhere to go they surface to the
[2333.44 - 2338.28] skin and you get the rashes they can be
[2335.76 - 2340.68] shapes and size es all kinds they can be
[2338.28 - 2344.16] butterfly they can be not butterfly they
[2340.68 - 2346.40] can be everything blotches blotches here
[2344.16 - 2348.48] everywhere and that's why everybody's so
[2346.40 - 2349.92] confused and they're staying confused
[2348.48 - 2351.80] and then the doctors who just you know
[2349.92 - 2353.72] like because lime is getting so popular
[2351.80 - 2355.80] it's like just no wait it's been lime
[2353.72 - 2358.48] all this time and then Lupus patients
[2355.80 - 2360.48] get bombarded with a ton of antibiotics
[2358.48 - 2362.04] which a lot of lime doctors have learned
[2360.48 - 2363.60] over the last 30 years they practice
[2362.04 - 2365.28] that it was a mistake so they're doing
[2363.60 - 2367.32] way less of that thank God and they're
[2365.28 - 2369.80] using cat's claw and they're using other
[2367.32 - 2371.76] things but they don't realize those
[2369.80 - 2373.48] practitioners don't realize the reason
[2371.76 - 2376.16] why cat's Claw is working is because
[2373.48 - 2379.32] cats claw kills Epstein
[2376.16 - 2383.48] bar it kills
[2379.32 - 2385.52] viruses that are creating lime symptoms
[2383.48 - 2387.12] and they're like oh okay well now we're
[2385.52 - 2389.36] on to something we're doing less
[2387.12 - 2391.56] antibiotics and sometimes no antibiotics
[2389.36 - 2393.48] at all and we're using vitamin C and IV
[2391.56 - 2397.20] infusions and we're using cats claw and
[2393.48 - 2399.72] we're getting results thank God Spirit
[2397.20 - 2401.64] was able to give those results 30 years
[2399.72 - 2404.40] ago to all the lime people that came to
[2401.64 - 2406.36] me and I've had to recover hundreds and
[2404.40 - 2408.72] hundreds and hundreds of lime patients
[2406.36 - 2410.64] over the last three decades because
[2408.72 - 2413.64] Spirit gave me the advanced information
[2410.64 - 2415.20] I'm giving you today then when it was
[2413.64 - 2418.56] really
[2415.20 - 2420.84] prehistoric back then really
[2418.56 - 2422.52] prehistoric I love it when someone comes
[2420.84 - 2424.52] to me and be like yeah you know this new
[2422.52 - 2426.64] lime doctor is great doesn't use
[2424.52 - 2428.24] antibiotics he's just starting to use
[2426.64 - 2430.08] vitamin C IV and he's just starting to
[2428.24 - 2432.08] use some cats claws like great I was
[2430.08 - 2434.00] doing that 30 years ago cuz the spirit
[2432.08 - 2436.44] helping my people live their life and
[2434.00 - 2440.04] get better then so they can have a life
[2436.44 - 2442.16] now and you know so the good news is
[2440.04 - 2445.20] it's shifting am I being sarcastic I
[2442.16 - 2446.68] think so it's shifting it's shifting and
[2445.20 - 2449.88] that's the good
[2446.68 - 2453.20] news but with lupus yes those rashes
[2449.88 - 2455.88] they're all dermato toxins coming from a
[2453.20 - 2458.92] virus that's releasing the poison after
[2455.88 - 2461.96] consum consuming poison in the liver and
[2458.92 - 2463.44] in the body including foods that we're
[2461.96 - 2465.76] not supposed to be eating whatever that
[2463.44 - 2469.08] might be dairy products cheese milk
[2465.76 - 2471.24] butter eggs ghee whatever it's just
[2469.08 - 2474.20] anything like that can feed viruses
[2471.24 - 2476.20] really bad and so that's something there
[2474.20 - 2477.92] canola oil can feed viruses really bad
[2476.20 - 2480.44] we got to be careful and stay away from
[2477.92 - 2483.28] that we got to be cautious on the animal
[2480.44 - 2484.84] proteins I'm not anti-animal protein I
[2483.28 - 2486.64] say it again I say it in the different
[2484.84 - 2490.00] groups I've always said look it's about
[2486.64 - 2491.72] lowering your animal protein it's you if
[2490.00 - 2493.48] you're a big animal protein person you
[2491.72 - 2495.00] can keep it but you got to lower it you
[2493.48 - 2496.44] can't be doing eggs and bacon for
[2495.00 - 2498.00] breakfast in the morning it's not going
[2496.44 - 2499.88] to get you better I don't care what
[2498.00 - 2501.72] anybody says whatever belief system is
[2499.88 - 2503.84] out there cuz it's not about a belief
[2501.72 - 2504.64] system here it's about what's wrong with
[2503.84 - 2506.84] you
[2504.64 - 2508.16] internally that's another problem I have
[2506.84 - 2510.96] every now and then somebody to be like
[2508.16 - 2513.56] look I think you're anti- you're anti
[2510.96 - 2516.88] the high protein animal diet out there
[2513.56 - 2518.32] no that's not it I'm anti whatever is
[2516.88 - 2520.28] going to happen that shouldn't be
[2518.32 - 2523.00] happening inside the body that we can
[2520.28 - 2524.84] change by doing something different so
[2523.00 - 2526.20] something gets better in the body I
[2524.84 - 2527.72] don't know if I'm anti whatever that
[2526.20 - 2531.76] meant but you know what I
[2527.72 - 2533.44] mean and and so if you're big on animal
[2531.76 - 2535.68] protein you've been diagnosed with lupus
[2533.44 - 2538.60] that's got to you got to cut that back
[2535.68 - 2540.76] I'm just saying because I'll tell you
[2538.60 - 2543.00] why the animal fat in the animal protein
[2540.76 - 2545.20] is hard on the liver and with lupus you
[2543.00 - 2547.00] always have a liver problem there's
[2545.20 - 2549.00] always a liver issue that's why the
[2547.00 - 2551.36] inflammation tests even come out like
[2549.00 - 2553.72] they do when they come out the Ana
[2551.36 - 2555.60] anti-nuclear antibody test comes out in
[2553.72 - 2558.40] a lot of new lupus people because it's
[2555.60 - 2560.64] just gear it's showing inflammation C
[2558.40 - 2563.64] reactive protein showing
[2560.64 - 2565.36] inflammation and these are showing
[2563.64 - 2567.72] something that inflammation stemming
[2565.36 - 2569.40] from the liver that's from having a
[2567.72 - 2571.60] viral infection deep in the liver
[2569.40 - 2575.24] longterm like every single lime person
[2571.60 - 2577.32] has as well and that can release a lot
[2575.24 - 2579.16] of rashing and sometimes it just
[2577.32 - 2581.12] releases depending on what variety of
[2579.16 - 2583.72] Epstein bar you have and what strain you
[2581.12 - 2586.12] have sometimes it just releases the
[2583.72 - 2589.44] neurotoxin causing the joint pain and
[2586.12 - 2591.80] not the rashes it all depends the fever
[2589.44 - 2594.88] is because you have the virus there
[2591.80 - 2597.44] too that's that's happening as well
[2594.88 - 2599.56] organs getting inflamed isn't your body
[2597.44 - 2602.00] attacking the organ and that's what
[2599.56 - 2604.48] happens with medicine today they're
[2602.00 - 2606.40] putting lupus in the autoimmune category
[2604.48 - 2608.20] your body's attacking itself your the
[2606.40 - 2611.40] problem your body's the
[2608.20 - 2614.08] problem and um and so that's that's
[2611.40 - 2616.52] where you fall into the category there
[2614.08 - 2618.84] too eventually lime will just be thrown
[2616.52 - 2620.64] in autoimmune as well later on I maybe
[2618.84 - 2623.08] it already did so far and I didn't I
[2620.64 - 2625.32] didn't you know I didn't get told about
[2623.08 - 2627.96] that I don't check about I don't check
[2625.32 - 2629.92] on what's happening out there too often
[2627.96 - 2632.68] I get Advanced information from Spirit
[2629.92 - 2634.60] that's always forward past it so I never
[2632.68 - 2636.44] I never really you know I never because
[2634.60 - 2638.60] I you know there's something sometimes
[2636.44 - 2640.16] you get you know how if you if you look
[2638.60 - 2643.52] into things that are so cockeyed and
[2640.16 - 2645.80] they're so they're so they're so
[2643.52 - 2647.80] backwards that you you you almost get
[2645.80 - 2651.20] like what is it you start losing brain
[2647.80 - 2652.96] cells and that's what happens out there
[2651.20 - 2654.96] so um so I don't know if they've deemed
[2652.96 - 2656.56] Lyme disease in the autoimmune you know
[2654.96 - 2658.00] category yet or whatever I'm sure
[2656.56 - 2660.88] they're probably heading there but
[2658.00 - 2663.64] damaged organs everything around that
[2660.88 - 2665.40] you know um inflamed organs kidneys
[2663.64 - 2668.52] kidney problems with lupus that's that's
[2665.40 - 2670.96] a viral inflammation inflammation that
[2668.52 - 2674.32] because a virus is creating the
[2670.96 - 2676.60] inflammation not your body antibodies
[2674.32 - 2678.40] produced by your body are trying to go
[2676.60 - 2679.92] after the virus they're not inflaming
[2678.40 - 2681.48] you they're trying to go after the virus
[2679.92 - 2683.40] they're trying to work on it now you
[2681.48 - 2685.08] need to know that you're viral so that
[2683.40 - 2686.84] your body works for you even more and
[2685.08 - 2688.68] you need to know you can stomp it out
[2686.84 - 2690.96] and you can kick it out and you can beat
[2688.68 - 2693.24] it down and you could win this and you
[2690.96 - 2695.60] can heal I've seen it I've helped people
[2693.24 - 2697.96] go through it for years and years and
[2695.60 - 2697.96] years
[2698.28 - 2701.60] and have helped them get past it cuz
[2700.32 - 2704.48] when you know the truth and you know
[2701.60 - 2706.84] what's wrong you can heal you can you
[2704.48 - 2709.36] have a better chance of healing versus
[2706.84 - 2711.08] completely not knowing and and and be
[2709.36 - 2713.28] and just falling in the whole chronic
[2711.08 - 2716.48] illness pattern that's out there in the
[2713.28 - 2719.72] world where there's just so much
[2716.48 - 2721.88] confusion so getting the inflammation
[2719.72 - 2723.92] down got it back down on the animal
[2721.88 - 2727.00] protein when it comes down to lupus so
[2723.92 - 2729.76] your kidneys so your liver can actually
[2727.00 - 2732.76] heal the amount of bile your liver has
[2729.76 - 2735.88] to produce to break down animal fat is
[2732.76 - 2738.32] unbelievable you can't even imagine how
[2735.88 - 2741.44] much bile salt is needed how much bile
[2738.32 - 2744.36] is needed in general and and and to to
[2741.44 - 2747.60] try to break down and disperse that fat
[2744.36 - 2749.72] that's in a piece of lean meat I'm not
[2747.60 - 2751.56] anti-meat not anti-animal products you
[2749.72 - 2754.04] just have to minimize it this the same
[2751.56 - 2756.84] thing with vegans same thing with vegans
[2754.04 - 2757.88] vegans just this this is example someone
[2756.84 - 2759.80] also said wait a minute you're
[2757.88 - 2761.60] anti-vegan someone said that to me the
[2759.80 - 2763.48] other day I said no it depends on what's
[2761.60 - 2765.88] going on inside the body if you're
[2763.48 - 2768.24] eating too many nuts and seeds like
[2765.88 - 2769.76] putting tablespoons of nut Butters by
[2768.24 - 2771.72] the way there's all kinds of high fat
[2769.76 - 2774.40] diets out there that we're going to have
[2771.72 - 2776.44] to do a whole show just on that I know
[2774.40 - 2778.72] I'm going to get Flack I know that
[2776.44 - 2780.08] that's a trend that's taken over I know
[2778.72 - 2782.48] people are going to be pissed at me but
[2780.08 - 2785.04] it doesn't matter it's about you you got
[2782.48 - 2787.52] to remember something that's the whole
[2785.04 - 2789.76] point it's about watching your back it's
[2787.52 - 2792.48] about you that's that that's the whole
[2789.76 - 2794.84] point you know so if I got to take flak
[2792.48 - 2796.36] because there's a trend going on so what
[2794.84 - 2799.12] it's about getting you the right
[2796.36 - 2801.16] information okay that's the whole point
[2799.12 - 2803.84] so if you're doing tablespoons of nut
[2801.16 - 2805.56] Butters and coconut oil and blending
[2803.84 - 2808.20] that up in the morning it's hard on the
[2805.56 - 2809.84] liver you got to keep your fats down
[2808.20 - 2812.28] lower those fats when it comes down to
[2809.84 - 2816.32] lupus break them down 50% if you're
[2812.28 - 2819.64] vegan break it down 50% 50% less fats
[2816.32 - 2822.32] do an avocado that day okay do a handful
[2819.64 - 2824.12] of nuts the rest should be apples and
[2822.32 - 2826.04] other Foods it you shouldn't you
[2824.12 - 2827.84] shouldn't be doing all the fats the
[2826.04 - 2830.00] heavy fats the same thing with the uh
[2827.84 - 2831.80] high protein diet doing lots of animal
[2830.00 - 2833.92] protein plus you're doing coconut oil
[2831.80 - 2837.08] all the stuff you just hard on the liver
[2833.92 - 2838.52] but with lupus that is not a good thing
[2837.08 - 2841.40] it's not a good
[2838.52 - 2842.80] thing so that's something to understand
[2841.40 - 2846.44] it's something to always kind of get in
[2842.80 - 2848.72] your psyche um Epstein bar protocol for
[2846.44 - 2850.36] Lupus now lupus people are really
[2848.72 - 2852.80] sensitive just like so many other people
[2850.36 - 2854.72] lime people everything exactly they're
[2852.80 - 2856.76] really sensitive so you start slow you
[2854.72 - 2859.36] get the right kind of B12 oh I've been
[2856.76 - 2861.60] on B12 I've been on B2 the the the the
[2859.36 - 2864.08] adino silab ball and meth meththa Bolam
[2861.60 - 2865.60] in adino silab balum in combination if
[2864.08 - 2867.60] you go to my website you can find a
[2865.60 - 2869.32] directory I don't sell the supplements
[2867.60 - 2870.80] you just but there's a directory to get
[2869.32 - 2873.40] you to the right
[2870.80 - 2875.20] ones and you get the right kind of B12
[2873.40 - 2876.28] you get the right kind of zinc cuz zinc
[2875.20 - 2878.40] is critical
[2876.28 - 2880.24] for it's an anti-inflammatory because it
[2878.40 - 2882.12] shuts down the Epstein bar virus that's
[2880.24 - 2883.80] something to think about you want to get
[2882.12 - 2886.64] a little that go to your practitioner
[2883.80 - 2889.32] talk to your practitioner about it cat's
[2886.64 - 2892.08] claw it's an amazing one I mean it's
[2889.32 - 2895.12] it's like God's Gift God's gift to us
[2892.08 - 2896.68] for for battling viral issues you can
[2895.12 - 2898.80] even do a little bit on and off some
[2896.68 - 2900.12] golden seal little bit of golden seal on
[2898.80 - 2902.68] and off here and there talk to your
[2900.12 - 2904.48] practitioner too lysine it's amazing for
[2902.68 - 2906.80] Lupus take a little bit each day you
[2904.48 - 2909.60] start small if you need to vitamin C is
[2906.80 - 2912.52] a miracle for Lupus that's a miracle for
[2909.60 - 2914.64] Lupus as well okay so vitamin C that's
[2912.52 - 2916.44] another one lemon bomb yeah these are
[2914.64 - 2918.16] the Staples these are the basics the
[2916.44 - 2920.16] reason why is because there's a lot of
[2918.16 - 2922.44] people that are viral a lot of people
[2920.16 - 2925.52] that have viruses low grade and high
[2922.44 - 2927.92] grade low grade or or B in their system
[2925.52 - 2930.92] and so all this is important foods you
[2927.92 - 2933.44] know what to avoid avoid the dairy avoid
[2930.92 - 2935.92] the eggs eggs are just the worst for any
[2933.44 - 2938.52] chronic illness the worst and I feel bad
[2935.92 - 2941.44] because you know there just farm raised
[2938.52 - 2943.08] chickens and pasture raised and they're
[2941.44 - 2945.36] pecking and they're eating grass seeds
[2943.08 - 2947.52] and they're all happy and beautiful eggs
[2945.36 - 2950.28] and the yolk is so gorgeous you open it
[2947.52 - 2953.00] up you got that deep yolk color and it's
[2950.28 - 2956.44] like it's like this amazing beautiful
[2953.00 - 2958.44] food right I get it but the problem is
[2956.44 - 2960.96] the viruses of today feed off of eggs no
[2958.44 - 2962.84] matter where what how when so you just
[2960.96 - 2964.68] got to take an egg break take an egg
[2962.84 - 2966.28] break all right you get better maybe you
[2964.68 - 2967.68] can have it a couple of eggs again maybe
[2966.28 - 2971.20] you could have the neighbors chicken
[2967.68 - 2972.92] eggs again okay look so um but stay away
[2971.20 - 2975.76] from the foods that are you know that
[2972.92 - 2978.32] you got to stay away from foods to bring
[2975.76 - 2980.72] in don't be afraid of fruit bring in a
[2978.32 - 2982.92] little bit of fruit try some different
[2980.72 - 2985.44] fruits you know stay consistent on
[2982.92 - 2988.04] apples get the wild blueberries in there
[2985.44 - 2990.92] celery juice that's an amazing weapon
[2988.04 - 2993.48] powerful weapon extraordinarily um
[2990.92 - 2995.72] healing weapon when it comes down to the
[2993.48 - 2997.36] liver when it comes down to cleaning out
[2995.72 - 2999.88] toxins out of the body when it comes
[2997.36 - 3002.64] down to um helping out edema lymphodema
[2999.88 - 3004.96] all the different symptoms so celery is
[3002.64 - 3006.92] good fennel you can juice fennel the
[3004.96 - 3008.64] bulbs of fennel if you can find some of
[3006.92 - 3010.56] those the bulbs of fennel you can juice
[3008.64 - 3012.72] those juicing not easy I totally
[3010.56 - 3016.12] understand so if you can just if you can
[3012.72 - 3018.40] just do some more green salads and chop
[3016.12 - 3020.36] up more cucumbers for your salads put a
[3018.40 - 3022.88] little avocado in there trade it out
[3020.36 - 3024.52] instead of turkey that that that that
[3022.88 - 3026.20] day and then you know have your turkey
[3024.52 - 3029.32] for dinner or something whatever but you
[3026.20 - 3031.40] know try to bring your fats down your
[3029.32 - 3033.64] animal fats down bring just a little bit
[3031.40 - 3035.96] maybe a little bit of avocado in try to
[3033.64 - 3038.40] switch it up change the diet get the
[3035.96 - 3041.28] diet cleaner I know the 28-day cleanse
[3038.40 - 3043.40] in the first book um got a lot of people
[3041.28 - 3045.68] with lupus better because they got a lot
[3043.40 - 3046.72] of people with Epstein bar better it was
[3045.68 - 3049.84] an
[3046.72 - 3052.60] antiviral um diet the 28-day cleans was
[3049.84 - 3054.36] an antiviral diet and um and that's
[3052.60 - 3057.64] something you can maybe play with maybe
[3054.36 - 3061.40] do two days of it just two days of it
[3057.64 - 3062.96] one day of it could could be helpful
[3061.40 - 3065.36] most importantly know this is not your
[3062.96 - 3067.40] fault you're didn't created you can heal
[3065.36 - 3068.60] viruses don't like you knowing the truth
[3067.40 - 3070.72] the minute you know the truth you start
[3068.60 - 3072.20] getting better things start changing
[3070.72 - 3074.44] your body you wouldn't believe what your
[3072.20 - 3076.84] body does when you know what's going on
[3074.44 - 3079.48] inside and it's not just this random
[3076.84 - 3081.08] label with no identification of what
[3079.48 - 3083.48] really is
[3081.08 - 3086.52] happening it's it you wouldn't believe
[3083.48 - 3089.32] what the body does it it takes over it
[3086.52 - 3091.76] takes over and it starts to run the show
[3089.32 - 3093.84] better than ever before and it starts
[3091.76 - 3095.68] going after the viral matter it starts
[3093.84 - 3097.60] going after the viral cells and you
[3095.68 - 3100.56] start building yourself back
[3097.60 - 3102.52] up start building yourself back up you
[3100.56 - 3105.64] keep a lie heart you didn't create your
[3102.52 - 3109.04] lupus lupus isn't your fault it's not it
[3105.64 - 3111.80] at all never was never will be it's a
[3109.04 - 3114.92] storm that will pass I've seen it pass
[3111.80 - 3117.60] with hundreds and hundreds it's not your
[3114.92 - 3119.88] storm it's a storm that's dragging you
[3117.60 - 3122.28] in that's pulling you in but it doesn't
[3119.88 - 3124.40] Define you it's a storm that will pass
[3122.28 - 3128.92] it's not your fault you didn't create
[3124.40 - 3131.60] the storm everything changes and nothing
[3128.92 - 3134.56] stays the same even if you've had loopus
[3131.60 - 3136.44] for 10 years you've lost the early 20s
[3134.56 - 3138.08] of your life I know a lot of people
[3136.44 - 3140.36] they're like a lot of women they're like
[3138.08 - 3141.60] you know what you know all my friends

[3145.80 - 3151.76] they needed to do um they you know and
[3149.28 - 3153.04] and I couldn't because I had lupus I
[3151.76 - 3155.08] couldn't because I had lupus I've been
[3153.04 - 3156.64] really slowed down you're going to pick
[3155.08 - 3158.72] it up on the backside you're going to
[3156.64 - 3159.88] pick it up on the end on the flip side
[3158.72 - 3161.40] you're going to get it in your later
[3159.88 - 3163.12] years meaning you're going to get rid of
[3161.40 - 3164.96] lupus and you're going to get the good
[3163.12 - 3167.24] times are going to roll okay and you're

[3183.44 - 3188.24] away at the stone a little bit at a time
[3186.08 - 3190.36] okay check out um the Epstein bar in
[3188.24 - 3192.04] book one the Epstein bar chapter look at
[3190.36 - 3194.12] some of the supplements there listen to
[3192.04 - 3195.64] the Epstein bar show too cuz that's what
[3194.12 - 3197.60] lupus is the reason why I'm not giving
[3195.64 - 3199.40] you a lot of fruits and vegetables and a
[3197.60 - 3201.72] lot of different supplements right now
[3199.40 - 3203.92] is because it's the Epstein bar you can
[3201.72 - 3206.12] EAS just you you go to the Epstein bar
[3203.92 - 3209.20] show look at the book
[3206.12 - 3211.52] and the thyroid book coming out I talk
[3209.20 - 3213.80] about Epstein bar and some other things
[3211.52 - 3215.96] information I've never released or
[3213.80 - 3218.60] talked about on this show or put in any
[3215.96 - 3221.64] book and it's more than that I talk
[3218.60 - 3224.76] about 88 different conditions and
[3221.64 - 3226.92] illnesses and symptoms and and
[3224.76 - 3228.52] information about the thyroid and the
