1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,959
okay we're ready

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,640
we're talking about the immune system

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,740
how it protects the brain and how the

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,260
brain relies on the immune system we're

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,400
in the brain saver books you guys

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,220
books that are mind boggling

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,900
mind-blowing like seriously and there's

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,260
so much information in the brain saver

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,180
books there's two brain saver books okay

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,939
there's so much information in these

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,420
it's line for line for line I promise

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,540
you the greatest books of all time hands

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,059
down in health these will go down as the

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,280
greatest books ever in health I can

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,120
stand behind that I can say it with

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,940
being proud I can say it with confidence

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,340
the greatest books in history in health

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,620
no one can touch them science research

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,820
can't touch them nobody can touch what's

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,800
in these books and what they're going to

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,680
do for people to move their their lives

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,300
forward with sickness and illness

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,920
nothing will compare there will never be

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,600
a book out there by any other health

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,660
author any other health you know

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,299
industry that can ever touch the

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,479
original unique incredible mind-blowing

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,159
comprehensive detailed information

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,439
that's in the brain favorite books it

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,960
will never ever happen again you're

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,100
witnessing history I can say this if

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,540
you're somebody that came on here and

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,979
you don't own medical medium or medical

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,900
medium information you're saying well

35
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,460
he's biased it's his books uh they're

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,400
not my books

37
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,920
it comes from above I'm a messenger that

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,540
got the information placed it into the

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,360
books

40
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,380
and yes the books are there for the

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,880
people and these the reason why I sound

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,439
a little snarky about that is because

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,360
someone was like oh yeah but they're

44
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,700
they're your books and the reason why

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,420
I'm snark is like okay yeah sure but the

46
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,540
information came from above I'm not that

47
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:56,040
smart and if you believe it didn't come

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,740
from above and you believe that I'm that

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,180
I created this information that's in the

50
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,119
medical meaning book series and in the

51
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,340
brain saver books then okay I'm a genius

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,940
I'm a genius then I don't know what to

53
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,619
say I must be a genius he's a genius

54
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,099
everybody

55
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:17,640
but I'm not a genius Valerie said you're

56
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:20,760
pretty smart aw I'm not a genius

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,500
the information in these books is so

58
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Advanced it's a head of science and

59
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,760
research

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,099
real solutions real causes real truth

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,599
you can't find this anywhere else you

62
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,940
will never find this anywhere else I

63
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,860
could say this proud the information

64
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,520
came down

65
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,819
I put it in the books it's here and I'm

66
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,980
not a genius for sure and when you read

67
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:48,440
these books because no one could make

68
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,420
this up it can't even be made up

69
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,420
none of it can just like in the medical

70
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,800
medium books and it paves the way in

71
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,660
alternative medicine and conventional

72
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,420
medicine because they poach and steal

73
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,599
from the mm books mm publishes it first

74
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,940
and they poach and steal it and of

75
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,680
course they they you know and then they

76
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,140
put slander on medical me but the point

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,700
is is this is literally a time in

78
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,739
history that's very special the brain

79
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,700
saver books I'm talking about the immune

80
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,040
system

81
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,840
how the brain relies on your immune

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,480
system to protect it

83
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,180
the brain relies on your immune system

84
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,239
to protect it okay and so that's

85
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,840
important to know all on its own so

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,480
here I am let me move these for now

87
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,480
move them over

88
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,060
if you don't have a copy

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,159
maybe someday you will I want to talk

90
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,019
about cleaning your book too which is

91
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,340
interesting so we're going to talk about

92
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,900
that in a little bit but let's get

93
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,080
through this

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,500
our immune system

95
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,400
they fight our immune system fights

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,280
to defend us our brain relies on your

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,260
immune system now I'm just giving you a

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,480
forewarning here talked about how the

99
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,159
brain shot therapy is so powerful that

100
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,599
you're gonna get into that instant

101
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,360
relief and it's going to be an

102
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,239
experience that isn't explainable unless

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,879
you experience it yourself honest to God

104
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,220
but I'm also talking about every line in

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,139
these books both these books

106
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,860
every line

107
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,419
is jammed packed with with information

108
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,320
highly detailed information so let's get

109
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,320
into it a little bit

110
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,639
there's no way humankind could

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,440
physically evolve faster than any of

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,780
these forces against us just listen to

113
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,840
that one line just one line

114
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,660
out of thousands of lines in these books

115
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,840
there's no way

116
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,680
humankind could physically evolve faster

117
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,960
than any of these forces against us

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,479
which brings us to the immune system so

119
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,380
what that means is

120
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,259
we can't out evolve

121
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,720
the chemical poisons the toxins the

122
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,160
exposures the garbage that our bodies

123
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,199
are faced everybody's getting kicked off

124
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,060
IG today unbelievable so they really

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,919
have it censored heavy

126
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,840
so

127
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,259
the whole point here that we're talking

128
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,800
about is when it comes down to it we

129
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:22,740
can't beat out the speed in which the

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,139
Earth is polluting our brains

131
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,699
so we need to be active in doing

132
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,380
something we have to learn how to

133
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,660
protect our brains we have to take care

134
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,600
of ourselves we have to have the answers

135
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,820
because right now

136
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,740
I mean the amount of people sick and the

137
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,720
amount of people dying is unbelievable

138
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,479
never before in history and it's all

139
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,699
kept hush hush hush hush out there

140
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,500
but never before in history have we seen

141
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,300
the amount of people dying and the

142
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,580
amount of people being sick globally

143
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,460
like it is right now it's unbelievable

144
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,259
unprecedented right

145
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,360
so this brings us to the immune system

146
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,100
which is responsible for protecting the

147
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,560
brain so our immune system has a

148
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,479
responsibility our immune cells have a

149
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,300
responsibility it's to protect our brain

150
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,160
our immune systems were never made for

151
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,080
what's evolving around us and that's a

152
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,479
problem all on its own our immune system

153
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,259
was never built

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,320
to handle what we are up against what is

155
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,360
being evolved around us like the

156
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,900
onslaught of everything we're up against

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,759
our immune systems were never created to

158
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,500
deal with that so we have to do

159
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,240
something we have to support our immune

160
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,699
systems we have to support our body

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,699
because it was never Geared for that

162
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,280
they weren't designed to fight off

163
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:44,039
engineered bugs that were manufactured

164
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,960
they weren't designed to deal with

165
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,819
toxins the our immune systems weren't

166
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,259
made to put up with all the amount of

167
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,479
chemicals

168
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,100
so our immune systems were never put up

169
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,900
with the amount of chemicals were up

170
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,280
against it was never put up they were

171
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,960
never our immune systems were never

172
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,880
created to deal with all the different

173
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,060
bugs and viruses like Epstein-Barr and

174
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,460
shingles and hhv6 and all the all the

175
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,979
different viral infections people have

176
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,840
our immune systems were never designed

177
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,639
to deal with chemicals this is something

178
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,840
that our immune systems have been put up

179
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,120
against

180
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,919
and everything's evolving around our

181
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,600
immune systems and our immune system's

182
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,520
job is to protect the brain and the

183
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,099
brain is relying on that

184
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,720
so there's things we can do to protect

185
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,400
our immune systems and to protect our

186
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,520
brain there's things we can do to

187
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,740
actually help our bodies

188
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,740
I mean that's incredible all on its own

189
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,940
our immune system was never designed to

190
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,419
be up against EMF

191
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:46,319
evolving around us right so EMF used to

192
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:51,840
just be this radio signals in the 1920s

193
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:55,380
the 1930s and 1940s radio signals

194
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,900
that was the first Onslaught against our

195
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,759
immune systems and our brain was radio

196
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,120
signals

197
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,539
that was the EMF of the day no biggie

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,340
was radio signals you know

199
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:10,199
so think about that right now how

200
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,180
interesting that is but our immune

201
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,360
systems were never designed for the

202
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,419
evolving EMF we're up against now

203
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,699
and the cell tower signaling that we're

204
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,560
up against now our immune systems were

205
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,160
never designed for that for cell tower

206
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,160
signals

207
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,979
our immune systems were never designed

208
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
to deal with the radiation we're up

209
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:33,419
against now you guys so that's something

210
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,560
that's a whole other level every time

211
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,360
something foreign enters into our body

212
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,399
whether it's EMF

213
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,800
whether it's radiation

214
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,959
whether it's pathogenic

215
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,959
whether it's a toxic chemical

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,100
every time something foreign enters into

217
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,800
our body even if it's in the form of

218
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,600
radiation our immune cells have to

219
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,120
gobble it up

220
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,100
really important to know

221
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:09,420
so every time we are up against anything

222
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:11,700
our immune cells have to eat it

223
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,279
have to gobble it up to protect our

224
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,420
brain so our brain's relying on this so

225
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,720
as

226
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,880
times are evolving

227
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,420
and we have

228
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,420
this attack this industry attack on our

229
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,519
physical bodies

230
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,720
as that's happening our brain is like

231
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,940
wait a minute here I'm relying on your

232
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,580
immune I'm relying on our immune system

233
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,040
you guys our brains talking like I'm

234
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,899
relying on your immune system

235
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,120
hey I'm relying on your immune system

236
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,620
like our brain is like

237
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,420
literally

238
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,820
screaming

239
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,580
our immune system has to save us and

240
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,580
protect us has to protect the brain

241
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,320
our brain has an intelligence our brain

242
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,320
has a metaphysical and physical

243
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,180
intelligence to know it's in trouble

244
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,700
with what we're up against all the time

245
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:10,620
between EMF and pathogenic problems and

246
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,800
radiation and toxic chemicals and all of

247
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,800
that

248
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:21,660
our immune system is the security system

249
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,360
against any attackers that want to

250
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,399
invade our brain think about that so

251
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,300
your immune system is the security

252
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,300
system

253
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,880
to actually stop attackers

254
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,040
to stop brain crime

255
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,380
our immune system

256
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,839
has a big job in defending our brain

257
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,480
so our brain is desperate

258
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,399
relies heavily

259
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,980
on our immune system

260
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,860
now check this out this is mind-blowing

261
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,959
all on its own right here

262
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,300
how long a white blood cell lasts

263
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,920
against a toxic Invader depends on how

264
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,800
toxic the substance is and that's

265
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,480
something that's huge all on its own

266
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,339
now one thing you'll find in the brain

267
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,839
saver books

268
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,300
is your

269
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,000
be educated on all the different things

270
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,160
we have to be concerned about

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,680
which is a big deal because that's so

272
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,060
important we need to be aware of of

273
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,920
what's going on

274
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,480
but people don't realize a lot of the

275
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,160
stuff they have in their life and that

276
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,720
they're partaking in their life is

277
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,399
breaking down their immune system and

278
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,019
they don't realize that and that's

279
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,060
really sad when you think about it all

280
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:39,740
on its own they don't know their immune

281
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,740
system is being broke down

282
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,420
how long a white blood cell how long a

283
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,079
white blood cell

284
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,060
lasts

285
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,060
against the toxic invader

286
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,260
okay

287
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,500
depends on how toxic the substance is

288
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,620
so your white blood cells job is to

289
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,620
gobble up anything in its way anything

290
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,079
that's heading to the brain EMF guess

291
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,720
what your immune cells are trying to

292
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:13,339
gobble up EMF radiation your immune

293
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,339
cells are trying to gobble up radiation

294
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,820
pathogens like that one your immune

295
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,200
cells are trying to gobble up pathogens

296
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,880
toxic chemicals your immune system is

297
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,459
trying to gobble up toxic chemicals

298
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,740
depending on how powerful that EMF is

299
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:32,600
how strong that radiation is how toxic

300
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:35,640
that chemical is how toxic that bug is

301
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,500
determines the lifespan of that white

302
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,760
blood cell that immune cell it

303
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,760
determines the lifespan

304
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,940
that's insane

305
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:50,339
nanopoisons from perfume and cologne

306
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,680
have to be gobbled up by our white blood

307
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:54,180
cells what

308
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,220
what

309
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:00,360
so anytime you get you breathe in

310
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:04,579
perfume your whites blood cells have to

311
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,579
gobble up the perfume particles

312
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,980
whoa Nano poisons like perfume and

313
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,240
cologne have to be gobbled up by our

314
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,620
white blood cells this is why when

315
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,760
people are breathing in Cologne and

316
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,980
they're sick and they're chronically ill

317
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,600
that clone just weakens them more makes

318
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,579
them sick brings on their migraines

319
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,740
brings on their sinus problems brings on

320
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,940
their fatigue even worse and more to the

321
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,459
point where they're just tasting the

322
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,440
cologne and it's so sickening

323
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,940
but your immune cells if you already

324
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,620
have a weak immune system and generally

325
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,300
immune cells have to gobble up every

326
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,300
part of that cologne nanoparticle

327
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:41,760
and cologne's not natural

328
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,820
none of that stuff's natural it's

329
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,000
chemical created lab created

330
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,680
important to know

331
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,899
nanoparticles from air fresheners and

332
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,820
scented candles have to be gobbled up is

333
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,139
the only one talking about plug-in air

334
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,180
fresheners

335
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,980
for years and years and now you'll see

336
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,560
on social media like some kind of doctor

337
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,540
influence or something pretending that

338
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,519
he just figured it out yesterday or

339
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,519
something that air fresheners are bad

340
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,800
but doesn't even cite mm but yet is

341
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,620
listening to the podcasts and listening

342
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,139
to everything but doesn't cite it back

343
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,519
so that people can find their way and

344
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,800
then they and then they sell the person

345
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,839
something bad for them like clay to eat

346
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,700
or charcoal or apple cider vinegar

347
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,160
gummies or crap like that it's

348
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,720
unbelievable

349
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,399
it's a sick world it's really A demented

350
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,540
World

351
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,000
nanoparticles from air fresheners and

352
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,220
scented candles have to be gobbled up

353
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,959
by your immune cells and that's a

354
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,940
problem all on its own your immune cells

355
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,820
have to gobble that junk up pathogens

356
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,579
such as these bugs right that everyone

357
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,019
lives with now people live with all the

358
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,000
different bugs inside of them you guys

359
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,540
know how that's why everybody gets sick

360
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,740
it's a big part of it the pathogens

361
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,620
right

362
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,540
I've seen Barr virus low-grade viral

363
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,459
infections weaken the immune system

364
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,959
because your white count has to gobble

365
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,740
it all up

366
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,980
flu viruses and beep

367
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:10,920
have to be gobbled up

368
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,420
flu viruses and bleep have to be gobbled

369
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,579
up

370
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,220
they have to

371
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,019
xic heavy metals that enter your body

372
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,120
through all kinds of beep and other

373
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,120
things and ways have to be gobbled up

374
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,060
and here's another thing people don't

375
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,860
realize caffeine

376
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,680
caffeine lowers the immune system

377
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,160
because it has to be eaten up by white

378
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,079
blood cells nobody knows that

379
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,480
meanwhile a caffeine industry evolving

380
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,760
around us new caffeine concoctions while

381
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,079
the caffeine industry evolves around us

382
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,000
you guys I'm reading out of brain saver

383
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,399
books check it out

384
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,600
check them out right here you won't be

385
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,660
disappointed when you get the brain

386
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,279
saver books books with an S you will be

387
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,440
mind blown

388
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,519
hands down the greatest books of all

389
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,699
time

390
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:02,399
and I'm sure just

391
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:04,019
people are going to be pissed about them

392
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,399
along the way

393
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,440
so I'm sure there's going to be plenty

394
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,820
of campaigns to try to like break down

395
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440
my credibility

396
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,440
and then this and then the information

397
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,199
here will be stolen over time by podcast

398
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,360
doctors or whoever else

399
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,160
so

400
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,899
but you can't break down street cred

401
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,160
millions of people healing around the

402
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,139
world and the most healing stories

403
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,019
around the world never before in our

404
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:30,000
history

405
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,680
and it's is what it is

406
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,940
so here's how it works let's go into it

407
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,920
a little bit and I got a couple of

408
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,680
things I want to do with you guys I want

409
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,980
to help you clean a book because

410
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,060
it's important because the books get

411
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,720
dirty

412
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,980
when they get shipped to you from Amazon

413
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,160
and I'm going to go into that in a

414
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,759
minute I know we're going off topic

415
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,959
so here's how it works as a white blood

416
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,959
cell gobbles up nanoparticles

417
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,339
whether it's toxic heavy metals air

418
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,220
fresheners fragrances perfumes colognes

419
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,679
pathogens radiation EMF when your white

420
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,900
count is gobbling it up

421
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,900
it's taking a hit for us

422
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,540
it's taking a hit and that hit is like a

423
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,579
stab to the white blood cell it means

424
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,459
the white blood cell won't last long so

425
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,799
that's how it goes the more exposure

426
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:28,620
exposure doesn't make you stronger I saw

427
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:31,320
somebody else take that from

428
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,900
and then in it's an influencer doctor

429
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,580
took that fairly recently too

430
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,059
and everybody's like what I never heard

431
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,059
that before

432
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,400
it doesn't make you stronger

433
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,020
exposures don't make you stronger your

434
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,520
immune system instead gets beaten down

435
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,380
and broken down and beaten down and

436
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,640
broken down and then your brain gets

437
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,440
exposed

438
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,260
vulnerable

439
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,539
so it's supposed to your your white

440
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,860
blood cells don't last long depending on

441
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:02,039
what they're up against as they're

442
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:05,580
trying to gobble up nanotechnology

443
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,740
the white blood cell ceases to live so

444
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,179
what happens is we walk around and we

445
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,919
get all these exposures in our white

446
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,140
blood cells die

447
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,299
and then new ones have to be created

448
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,940
it's interesting if you go into the

449
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:21,059
brain saver books you'll see an epic

450
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,820
blood draw chapter

451
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,080
I recommend highly recommend reading

452
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,059
that chapter but first of all I'll take

453
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,500
the book from the beginning and and get

454
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,299
through it because there's a lot to

455
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,679
digest in these books both of them

456
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,900
equally

457
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,340
but the blood draw chapter I talk a lot

458
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,780
about what happens when we get our blood

459
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,640
draw so here we are we're getting sick

460
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,020
from all these exposures check this out

461
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,120
you guys we're getting sick from all

462
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,740
these exposures

463
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,419
so we're getting our fatigue and our

464
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,799
diagnoses and our symptoms and our

465
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,000
neurological problems and our headaches

466
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,140
and our aches and pains and our

467
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,480
dizziness or whatever it is we're

468
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,580
dealing with burning skin trigeminal

469
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,740
neuralgia back pain feet pain whatever's

470
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,780
going on in your life

471
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,220
we're getting sick and then we go to the

472
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,860
doctors and they're drawing tons of

473
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,720
blood and they're taking out our immune

474
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,220
system at the same time the very thing

475
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,559
that's been eating up all these

476
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,960
exposures and eating them up trying to

477
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,460
protect your brain and then we go to the

478
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,980
doctor's office which I recommend the

479
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,600
doctor's office of course why not

480
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,760
she taught you bring the books to your

481
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,260
doctors but then they take all this

482
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,940
Blood Out

483
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,620
because that's not regulated it should

484
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,120
be regulated how much blood they take

485
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,039
out and for good reason they don't need

486
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,539
much to run a blood test and you should

487
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,700
read that in the blood draw chapter

488
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:32,100
section but then the immune system

489
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,940
lowers even more because we lose our

490
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,940
white blood count

491
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,700
when a white blood cell fights a

492
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,200
pathogen

493
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,200
the pathogen explodes

494
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,160
but the white blood cell eventually runs

495
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:52,620
out of strength and explodes itself

496
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,480
the white blood cell can explode with it

497
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,039
so check this out so we got the

498
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,799
pathogens inside of us that are white

499
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,539
counties going after the pathogen the

500
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,240
white count will eat the white blood

501
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:06,299
cell immune cell will eat the pathogen

502
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:10,520
until the pathogen is gone

503
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,520
and then explode itself

504
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,740
in many situations a white blood cell

505
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,539
dies when it's killing a pathogen whey

506
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,179
blood cells are not as easily replaced

507
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:26,340
as we think they are

508
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,620
that's for sure

509
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:32,179
they're precious

510
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,179
they're not easy to replace

511
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,160
the more white blood cells that die

512
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,440
quickly due to exposure the bigger the

513
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,880
gap before newly released ones arrive so

514
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,220
here's another thing the more exposures

515
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,760
we have the faster and more white blood

516
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,100
cells die and the longer duration occurs

517
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,100
between getting the new immune cells

518
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,440
from our bone marrow that duration is

519
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,700
longer and longer and longer and then

520
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,740
we're at the doctor's office because

521
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,400
we're sick I don't feel good I got

522
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,799
fatigued I got ticks and spasms I'm so

523
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,179
disconnect I have I feel disconnected I

524
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,679
have depression you're at the doctor's

525
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,460
office and they're drawing more blood

526
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,740
now and now you already have a gap

527
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,080
of immune cells being produced out of

528
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,419
your bone marrow and then as more

529
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,059
blood's being drawn the Gap widens even

530
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:23,580
more and we get sicker the brain saver

531
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:25,500
books are to save people's lives

532
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,179
the most advanced information to protect

533
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,580
people that no one knows or talks about

534
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,860
anywhere no functional doctor no medical

535
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,140
system no industry no doctor anywhere

536
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,600
the health care provider talks about

537
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,280
because they simply don't know this is

538
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,320
the most advanced information out there

539
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,120
I want to cover a couple little fun

540
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,700
things

541
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,400
so you guys spread this information

542
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,539
around about cleaning the books and I

543
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,960
want to talk about this for a second

544
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:54,900
when people order the books Amazon has

545
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,360
greasy conveyor belts so they have

546
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:01,080
conveyor belts so when you place your

547
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,080
order somebody working in Amazon takes

548
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,220
the book out of the box that's on the

549
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,120
shelf and they throw it on the conveyor

550
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,340
belt

551
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,340
this is what happens at Amazon and other

552
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,980
stores other other stores online

553
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,020
the conveyor belt has grease because

554
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,000
they're greasing the wheels on the

555
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,100
conveyor belt so they go along the

556
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,980
conveyor belt with a grease gun

557
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,500
Greece petrochemicals right and they

558
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,500
Grease the conveyor belts

559
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,179
they do it every day every week grease

560
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,340
just gets everywhere

561
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,020
the book goes down the conveyor belt

562
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,940
heading down it's getting ready to be

563
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,380
packaged or thrown in a box by another

564
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,179
guy

565
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,600
and then taped up

566
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:48,299
now it's important to know this because

567
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,960
you'll have grease or some kind of like

568
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:54,179
Grime on a brand new book now what often

569
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,860
happens is someone will see a little bit

570
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,600
of grease on their book and think they

571
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,919
don't have a brand new book so they'll

572
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,720
give medical medium a one star review

573
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,400
foreign

574
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,740
which is sad because no one gets it

575
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,740
but really it's a brand new book there

576
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,620
are no used medical medium books I mean

577
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,419
the Publishers prints out all these are

578
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,820
all brand new books

579
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:25,460
so then what you do is you put a tiny

580
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,460
bit of dish soap on a damp towel

581
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:34,980
and you can wipe your books really clean

582
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:36,179
and they'll just come out shiny clean I

583
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,640
want everybody to know this and tell

584
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,900
other people because you'll see people

585
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,480
confused once in a while there'll be

586
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,280
some grease on a book or something like

587
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,020
that and they'll be like what is that so

588
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,900
that's one way of doing it and you can

589
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,600
clean your book up real real nice brand

590
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,520
new book the other thing is you don't

591
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,440
see the grease on other books you might

592
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,700
have ordered in the past because medical

593
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,960
medium books are like this clean look to

594
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,000
them

595
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,280
so all the medical medium books have

596
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,320
that white behind everything and they're

597
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,240
really clean so when it goes down the

598
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,880
Amazon

599
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,020
conveyor belt and it gets recently you

600
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,580
don't see grease on all your other

601
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,299
products that come down Amazon's

602
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,299
conveyor belt

603
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,200
so you're gonna see that

604
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:24,900
you can use a handy wipe right so here's

605
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,059
a handy wipe with alcohol

606
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,000
that's the way I do it too so if I order

607
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:31,980
a book for a friend or something do like

608
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,460
a handy wipe and clean the cover like

609
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,500
that with the handy wipe

610
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,200
that's another way to get them really

611
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,080
nice and clean

612
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,240
that's great right there so

613
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,580
which is really which is really great

614
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,740
okay so another thing to just run by you

615
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,620
guys if you guys have a minute is the

616
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,260
smell of the books

617
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,280
so what's really incredible about the

618
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,280
medical medium book series

619
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,179
it's stored in a warehouse that has no

620
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:07,140
plug-in air fresheners

621
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:10,740
they're stored in a warehouse that has

622
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,500
no perfumes colognes plug-in air

623
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,280
fresheners

624
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,320
pesticides

625
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,260
fungicides

626
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,620
that all the other books are stored at

627
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,620
places

628
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:26,279
so what's really awesome my publisher

629
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,620
promises me that the warehouse is that

630
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:32,220
the medical medium books are stored in

631
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:34,620
after they're printed doesn't have any

632
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,320
of that chemical stuff I want people to

633
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,960
know this if you can tell other people

634
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,179
this is really an incredible thing

635
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,580
like really incredible

636
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,679
when I even think about it so I want

637
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,799
people to know how it works like this is

638
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,820
inside info on what we do to make sure

639
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:57,059
that your books

640
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:59,640
don't come saturate it in perfumes

641
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:01,140
clones scented candles now what happens

642
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,520
is

643
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:07,380
that my publisher is doing me a favor by

644
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,419
making sure the medical medium books

645
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,279
don't get stored in warehouses that have

646
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,740
all the scented candles

647
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,960
and detergents and other weird stuff and

648
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,000
all that so it's important to know but

649
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,240
here's the problem if you get a book

650
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,140
that seems like there's some smell to it

651
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,539
it's only because of where it went after

652
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,580
it was printed and stored at the

653
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:32,039
original Warehouse it has no smells and

654
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,840
sense that means that if it went to a

655
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,700
bookstore and the bookstore has a lot of

656
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,740
scented candles in the bookstore too and

657
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,360
you order the book online and the book

658
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,400
gets packaged up you might have a

659
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,140
scented candle smell on a book and then

660
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,640
you just give it time and just let it

661
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:50,340
air out another thing too is

662
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,380
the same thing with Amazon warehouses I

663
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,900
have no control over Amazon warehouses

664
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,760
and all the scented candle smells and

665
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,140
all the plug-in smells and everything

666
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,880
else same thing with all bookstore

667
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,980
warehouses I have no control over that

668
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,900
so if you do get one book that happens

669
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,539
to have a smell of

670
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,179
something perfume

671
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:10,679
then just know that over time that will

672
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:13,799
air out

673
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,360
and it's not the original Source like it

674
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,159
wasn't the medical medium books or the

675
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,720
medical medium books being printed this

676
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,880
is so important to know because some

677
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,679
people might get a book they order from

678
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,000
Amazon at a different Amazon warehouse

679
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,820
that happen to have plug-in air

680
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,919
fresheners or some kind of chemical or

681
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,600
they ordered it from a bookstore line or

682
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,400
walked into a bookstore and the

683
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,260
bookstore has scented candles in one

684
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,220
corner so everybody can have that

685
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,500
experience or whatever or and if there

686
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,960
is a smell know that it comes from way

687
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,820
after the fact from wherever you're

688
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,559
getting the book from but the original

689
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:53,640
place the book was printed and stored

690
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:55,440
was chemical free as far as no chemicals

691
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,960
that were in the warehouse floating

692
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,940
around no plugins no perfumes no clones

693
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,340
no anything like this and this was done

694
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:05,120
on purpose so that the medical medium

695
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:08,880
book line in the book series

696
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,520
really has the Purity factor to it which

697
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,500
leads me to another thing all on its own

698
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,320
the books

699
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,940
they're of the light you feel it you

700
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,640
know it when you read it you know it

701
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,279
when you hold it

702
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,799
not only are the these brain saver books

703
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,860
the greatest books of all time but you

704
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:30,720
feel that energy in these books you feel

705
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,960
the life you feel that it's not dead

706
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,900
material and books have dead words

707
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,779
they're just dead words on a page and

708
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:43,260
then these books they're not dead words

709
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:45,539
on a page books are living words and you

710
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,059
feel that energy and you know it's there

711
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,400
and when you read the material and

712
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:53,100
understand it and learn you'll be mind

713
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,020
blown and when you apply the

714
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,279
recommendations in these books you will

715
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,400
feel it

716
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:02,580
and that doesn't exist anywhere else and

717
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,200
so that's a whole thing on its own

718
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,000
so you guys we talked about the immune

719
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,460
system how the brain relies on the

720
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,860
immune system how important

721
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,779
that is for the brain

722
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,720
and I only just read a couple of

723
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:17,760
paragraphs that's all it was which is

724
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,640
really when you think about only reading

725
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,640
a couple of paragraphs I mean when I

726
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,899
think about that it blows my mind it

727
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,120
just does

728
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:29,399
and when I think about just a couple of

729
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,440
paragraphs versus how much which is in

730
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,980
here

731
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,020
um

732
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,240
anyway I have somebody here with me I

733
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:40,440
have a guest I have a

um coming in here so I hope you guys

736
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,480

famous

surgeon and psychiatrist who wants to

say hi

742

we weren't friends for a little while we

743
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,960
had a falling out and I was really upset

744
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,940
about it

745
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,159
and he was too

746
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,140
but we had a falling out because of the

747
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,120
alcohol problem he has even though he's

748
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,460
still a great surgeon I recommend his

749
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,120
surgeries to anyone

750
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,700
um

751
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,559
anyway are you gonna say hi to everybody

752
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,919
are you shy

753
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,240
Dr Nesbit says he's kind of shy but he

754
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,380
just wants to

755
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,179
see how everybody is for a second here

756
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,059
I hope no one's canceling their book

757
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:33,380
orders because of you Dr Nesbit I hope

758
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,380
nobody cancels your order

759
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,340
he says he doesn't care that's not a

760
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,159
nice thing to say

761
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,200
s he's kidding all right that's good he

762
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:46,620
says he's just joking around so Dr

763
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,059
Nesbitt has been off the alcohol for two

764
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:55,980
weeks now he's sober he only had one

765
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:58,080
surgical mistake last week he removed

766
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,720
um he removed

767
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,460
someone's

768
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,320
he was supposed to remove their

769
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,059
gallbladder but he removed their liver

770
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,820
instead and they tried to put the liver

771
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:12,059
back in the patient and

772
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:14,100
that's what insurance is for okay

773
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:16,080
it just didn't work out

774
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,760
patient's alive though

775
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,140
they're just walking around without a

776
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,159
liver

777
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,559
really

778
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,520
anyway so Dr nesbitt's just saying hi to

779
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,620

797
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:13,020
