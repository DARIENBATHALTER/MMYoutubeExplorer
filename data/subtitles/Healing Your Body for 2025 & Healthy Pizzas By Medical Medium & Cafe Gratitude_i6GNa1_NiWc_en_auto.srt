9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,160
problems out there is that people don't

path because they don't know something

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,040
else is better and something else is

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,960

right now of all the shock and awe and

365
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,040
Magic Bullets being thrown at them left

366
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,199
and right the crazy thing is is years

367
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,399
ago when there was some Magic Bullets

368
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:26,560
around then and nobody got better when

369
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,120
shil hit the fan nobody got better

370
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,399
everybody with chronic illness who had

371
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,480
thyroid diseases Hashimoto everybody

372
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,600
with fibro lime disease neurological

373
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,560
lime they took XY never got them better

374
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,800
fic minerals that was the next thing

375
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,120
back 20 years ago never got anybody

376
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,560
better it didn't and it was the next

377
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,560
thing and the next thing and next thing

378
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,920
and that's how it went but now we're in

379
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,959
a Land of there are hundreds of things

380
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,880
and hundreds of Magic Bullets and you

381
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,319
could swim in that stuff and sit in that

382
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,560
stuff for a really long time if you're

383
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:03,000
struggling

384
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,480
and you're sick with some neurological

385
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,279
problems so what are you doing for your

386
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,160
health like what are you doing because

387
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,079
what

388
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,360
I know is you have to have these

389
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:18,160
landmarks these foundational Staples you

390
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,720
have to have these solid

391
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,000
foundations

392
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,680
critical critical they have these solid

393
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,519
foundations and you got to stay with

394
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,759
these solid foundations and you got to

395
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,720
hold with them

396
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,680
because you need something there that

397
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,160
works so if you want to try all the

398
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,880
 out there or try the different

399
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,920
things and whatever flashy new thing

400
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,399
gets thrown at someone every single

401
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,399
person is being thrown a flashy new

402
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,800
thing sure you want to do that that's

403
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,959
great but you better have some

404
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,480
foundational tools you better have

405
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,160
something

406
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,959
there a

407
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,079
landmark there that's holding you strong

408
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,120
while you're trying trying to heal and

409
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,919
being thrown off left and right not

410
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,240
enough protein not enough

411
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,160
protein deficiencies

412
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,640
deficiencies you should be drinking out

413
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,919
of copper pots and copper you us using

414
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,319
copper utensils and wearing copper

415
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,240
jewelry and drinking copper thermoses

416
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,799
that's your answer it's not your answer

417
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,079
that's actually dangerous but that's

418
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,959
what I mean you should be freezing your

419
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,880
ass off you should be taking ice baths

420
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,720
you should be you should be putting

421
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,160
yourself into ice shock

422
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:37,559
no bad bad bad bad bad point

423
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,640
is point is you better have some

424
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,440
foundational tools so no matter what

425
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,679
you're doing you got something that's

426
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,480
helping you while you're getting pushed

427
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,600
into other things or pear pressured into

428
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,799
other things or tricked into other

429
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:56,760
things you need to have the core

430
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:00,120
foundational strength in your

431
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,400
healing so that you can hold strong and

432
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,080
then move forward especially with the

433
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,360
bugs to

434
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,280
come I mean four years

435
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,799
ago right it four years ago

436
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:17,400
now or is it more than four years ago

437
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,679
now right when the bug hit the town

438
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,400
there's going to be

439
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:25,159
more they're coming they're on the

440
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,760
way and you got to have that core

441
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:30,960
Foundation it's got to be

442
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,679
there so I came on here to say look this

443
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,240
is the start of the Year just wanted to

444
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,640
say hi to everybody also let you know

445
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,200
about the Killer Pizza party because

446
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,080
that alone is really

447
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,120
exciting but I want to talk about some

448
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,000
tools and I want to talk about the

449
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,760
foundational tools and I've said that

450
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,039
years ago too you needed the

451
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,720
foundational

452
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:58,039
tools very important for healing okay

453
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,400
for one simple some foods to avoid

454
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:04,600
simple I know you don't want to hear

455
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,559
this I know I get slammed every time

456
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,159
every

457
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:11,400
time and I'm ready to take a hit again

458
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm

459
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:19,120
ready I'm primed I'm ready this

460
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,400
year and I'm not messing

461
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,679
around but I want to tell you one of the

462
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,840
foods to avoid is the eggs I know when

463
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,760
people hear it they start freaking out

464
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,720
and then boom everybody body's on board

465
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,240
you know eggs are good for you you need

466
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,159
the protein they're filled with vitamins

467
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,000
and minerals they're filled with choline

468
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,039
they got everything you ever need it

469
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,039
it's eggs it's eggs it's eggs but I

470
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,200
promise you this whether anybody likes

471
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,400
it or not no matter how much crap I

472
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,360
get if you got chronic illness if you're

473
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,880
somebody that has a

474
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,159
symptom I promise you this those eggs

475
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,880
aren't going to help they're going to be

476
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,440
a monkey on your back and they're going

477
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,320
to hold you you down on your healing

478
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,720
process even if you keep them in there

479
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,120
and you're bettering you're getting a

480
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,520
little better with your illness because

481
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,000
you're doing a bunch of stuff and you

482
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,400
keep them in

483
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,280
there it's going to

484
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,320
eventually you're going to be back to

485
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,240
full circle or 180° however you want to

486
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,360
say

487
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,640
it because eggs will feed what's coming

488
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,919
and what's in people people still don't

489
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,280
realize it all the different pathogens

490
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,880
that were actually raised in labs and

491
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,480
manufactured

492
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,919
by classified medical research

493
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,480
science many many years ago they used

494
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,320
eggs to do it all the suffering people

495
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,240
have right now is from the herpes

496
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,280
viruses it's from the herpes simplex one

497
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,600
herpes simplex 2 it's what creates

498
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,159
cancer it's all the

499
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,000
viruses it's the epscene bars that end

500
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,799
up creating cancer it's all the

501
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,240
different bugs that end up creating

502
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,039
cancer and what happens is is that all

503
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,240
these bugs feed on something that people

504
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,120
don't realize it was what they were

505
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,000
raised on and it was eggs so that's just

506
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,760
one foundational tool right there you

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,720
throw everything else away and you just

508
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,559
say you know what I'm holding off on the

509
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,919
eggs you're doing yourself a

510
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,480
foundational

511
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,679
favor that alone right

512
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,360
there sure you want to go grab the Magic

513
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,360
Bullets left and right and everything

514
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:30,120
else but that's the big one right there

515
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:35,320
okay that's the big one

516
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:37,840
viruses feed on toxins equals cancer

517
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,600
viruses Staying Alive because they feed

518
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,240
on eggs so they can feed on toxins and

519
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:47,039
create cancer there you

520
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,320
go important to understand how it

521
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,520
works and right now we're heading into a

522
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,919
place where a lot of people are getting

523
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,960
sicker and sicker it's going to happen

524
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,360
faster and faster and you're going to

525
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,799
read more things about it and see more

526
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,960
things about it and there's going to be

527
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,880
a thousand more Magic Bullet companies

528
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,640
and Magic things and Magic Bullet this

529
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,799
and this to try and they're just going

530
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,919
to come out and be like Oh try this oh

531
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,400
no try that oh no you need to be doing

532
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,799
keto oh you need to be carnivore now oh

533
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,600
you need to do this you need to eat lots

534
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,440
of eggs oh you need your fish again or

535
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,080
your fish oil and it's going to go back

536
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,240
to this again and then the same old crap

537
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,880
happens right where you got the wars

538
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,000
between the plant-base and the carnivore

539
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,559
or keto and animal right you see this

540
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
now and I talked about it before did you

541
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,000
see how bad it's getting plant-based

542
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,240
movement

543
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,880
I'm on look I'm I totally support

544
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,200
plant-based I told this told you before

545
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,679
I also supported somebody's doing an

546
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,799
animal protein thing because there's

547
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,799
tools you can do medical meme tools fit

548
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,480
in both both places so you can do your

549
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,919
healing right but man the vegans whether

550
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,120
vegans know it or not they're asleep

551
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,039
right now on the plant-based people

552
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,080
they're asleep right now they're just

553
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,720
getting destroyed out there the

554
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,159
movements being destroyed it's the

555
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:00,440
saddest thing I've ever

556
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,480
seen okay and eggs are part of how

557
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,760
they're destroying it that's what's

558
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,480
crazy cuz no one wants to give up their

559
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,840
eggs on any level to come for food their

560
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,000
eggs they don't want to give up their

561
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,000
eggs no way that's one foundational tool

562
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,360
stay away from those if you're

563
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,840
chronically sick cuz I promise you they

564
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,640
are going to get in your way I don't

565
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,480
even have an egg prop with me right now

566
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,480

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,520
raw dairy people that're like raw dairy

626
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
raw dairy he's so stupid that medical

627
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,279
medium he's just talking about Dairy he

628
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,360
doesn't know he's talking about

629
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,799
pasteurized Dairy what a dummy he is he

630
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,880
doesn't know about raw dairy really I

631
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,960
don't duh

632
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,720
the irony I knew about raw dairy before

633
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,320
you've discovered raw dairy in the last

634
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,640
5 years and now you're eating it and

635
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,679
feeding it to your family I knew about

636
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,120
raw der a long time ago try decades ago

637
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,159
when maybe you weren't even born yet or

638
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,640
you were three years old I knew about

639
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,039
raw da it's still going to feed the

640
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,399
pathogens because once again no one's

641
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,120
really kind of like really locking into

642
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:26,279
the pathogen thing right now talking

643
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,840
about parasites a little they're talking

644
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,919
about you know they're talking about

645
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,880
this and hormones again back to the

646
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,399
hormone thing where it's all hormones

647
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,799
that's your problem it's all

648
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:38,360
hormones that's how I know it's not just

649
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,640
Spirit of compassion but that's how I

650
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,399
know how sick the world is getting in

651
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,279
the next 5 years because they're not

652
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:46,399
even they're not even on the pathogen

653
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,880
thing really yet they're talking about

654
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,200
hormones again dude that was talked

655
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,720

656
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,000

okay they they were all for caffeine

690
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,960
just a year ago two years ago drinking

691
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,039
it themselves every morning wake up in

692
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,360
the morning hey honey yep where's the

693
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:24,640
coffee and now they're starting to utter

694
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,559
it a little bit like caffeine's

695
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,320
bad and they're drinking alcohol too I

696
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:30,880
notice you'll see see some alcohol's bad

697
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,720
for you alcohol's bad for your brain

698
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,159
really because I put it in the books

699
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,679
that alcohol's bad for the brain but

700
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,039
anyway alcohol is bad for the brain now

701
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,559
so you see some people meanwhile they

702
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,840
were just drinking wine a couple of

703
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,880
years ago they had they had their

704
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,120
Revelation their Epiphany that like now

705
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,960
don't don't drink alcohol anymore and

706
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,120
shock and awe that person said don't

707
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,120
drink alcohol

708
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,760
whoa those are Basics those are easy

709
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,600
ones right there you know you shouldn't

710
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,799
be doing caffeine you know if you're

711
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,200
sick with chronic illness you shouldn't

712
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,640
be doing caffeine you shouldn't even be

713
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,360
doing chocolate you shouldn't be do

714
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,320
shouldn't be doing

715
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,320
um uh coffee green tea

716
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,159
matcha but people do it anyway should be

717
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,000
careful with chocolate if you're sick

718
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,760
with chronic illness but it's really

719
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,120
hard to break away from that and I

720
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,039
completely understand it see I'm not

721
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,679
judging anybody it's not about judging

722
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:27,559
anyone cuz I get it life is hard it's

723
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:31,760
easy to go to chocolate and caffeine and

724
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:34,000
coffee and cheese and eggs life is hard

725
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,799
totally get it foundational pieces

726
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,600
though you can take

727
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,679
them smack them out of my hands fine

728
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,760
either

729
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,279
way that's what you can

730
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,880

doing just a few years ago

821
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,480
nothing and what were they really doing

822
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,200
a few years ago they had anything to do

823
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,039
with he heavy metals

824
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:56,039
nothing the system set up right now it's

825
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,039
rigged for failure for people so they

826
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:59,120
won't heal and the one thing I want the

827
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:02,080
reason why I'm saying this and bringing

828
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,600

829
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,599

837
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,440
this

838
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,440
works and has gotten people out of

839
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,839
wheelchairs not just one person

840
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,960
hundreds and

841
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,320
hundreds something that can never be

842
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,520
done out there and this industry doesn't

843
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,720
like that that's why I'm always attacked

844
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,599
that's why I'm always right that's why

845
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,200
I'm always censored attack Shadow band

846
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,639
you name it everything that's ever

847
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,359
happened and then people trying to talk

848
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:51,520
 but one thing's for certain you do

849
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:52,919
the right tools you heal I mean take the

850
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,159
books to your doctor ask them what's

851
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:57,800
right for

852
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,680
you but I know what's in here moves

853
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,680
people forward and moves the needle and

854
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,200
gets them better if they do it right

855
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,040
meaning they just don't do it one day or

856
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,720
they don't do it just do it one week and

857
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,119
they do it half ass one week and then

858
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,720
they're eating all this chocolate not

859
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,000
telling anybody and they're eating all

860
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,839
this other stuff and they're getting

861
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,240
blood taken out for no reason left and

862
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:21,480
right and they're doing you know and

863
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,480
they're getting all kinds of

864
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,200
stuff and all this stuff's happening

865
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,079
then it's going to take takes some time

866
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,640
you got to get on it you got to work it

867
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,480
you got to put this into motion and you

868
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,480
got to heal and you can heal for

869
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:43,000
2025 if I was a fly on the wall the fly

870
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,000
is going to come back by the

871
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:51,079
way if I was a fly on the

872
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,520
wall and I can see what people are

873
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,440
doing they're doing

874
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,560
unbelievable if I could look at their

875
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,880
credit card receipts their credit card

876
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,720
statements if I could look at their

877
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,839
restaurants they're eating in what

878
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,319
they're buying at the grocery store what

879
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:15,280
they're eating while they're drinking a

880
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:18,560
celery juice 3 years ago for a month or

881
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,480
something if I can see what people are

882
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,040
doing and I can to some

883
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,960
degree fin wall

884
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,480
can so can

885
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,280
unfortunately a lot of people don't tell

886
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,760
the truth and they won't say what

887
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,079
they're really doing what they're really

888
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,000
eating and that's another thing that

889
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,599
happens because that's how social works

890
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,200
that's how people work

891
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:44,560
but the heavy metal detox has turned

892
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,560
lives

893
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,000
around and it works it works and if

894
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,280
someone's pushed away from it because of

895
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,040
a campaign trying to lead people to

896
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,960
whatever they're selling or whatever

897
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,760
crapping hes they're selling whatever it

898
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,839
is and they miss out on a chance to heal

899
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,040
cuz now they're afraid of cilantro and

900
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,560
now they're afraid of something like

901
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,240
spirina or they're afraid of something

902
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,880
and they don't know what they could they

903
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,720
don't know how to heal you just send

904
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,160
them down to track and they're going to

905
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,640
be stuck for another five years after

906
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,599
they paid thousands and thousands of

907
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,880
dollars for programs chrisa Ritz it

lot and that matters having the right

913

stuff so back

914
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,920
to back to some foundations okay if you

915
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,640
can just bring in the hmds into your

916
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,760
life if you can do just do the morning

917
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,319
cleanse if you could just do the celery

got the brain shot Therapies in the

922
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,960
brainsaver books I mean I know many of

923
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,160
you guys live by them I know many of you

924
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,119
guys have tried them but they're mental

925
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,240
health

926
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,599
tools they are mental health

927
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,200
tools healing is

928
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,480
possible there's a way to do it it's in

929
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,480
our

930
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:30,560
hands the brain shot therapies help

931
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,839
physically and mentally both physically

932
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,119
and

933
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,800
mentally truly

934
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:38,280
powerful so it's go to a couple couple

935
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,440
other things here

936
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,440
so all

937
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,599
right why do you have to have these

938
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,880
foundational tools because some people

939
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,079
are under a lot of stress their adrenals

940
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,040
are pumping they're doing fight or

941
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,359
flight you know anybody in fight ORF

942
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,440
flight know anybody that's up against

943
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,440
that periodically fight ORF flight

944
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:06,000
right so the foundational tools are

945
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,640
critical you got to have your zinc you

946
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,040
got to have your

947
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,200
B12 you got to have your micro C you got

948
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,240
to have your vitamin C you have to have

949
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,880
some foundational tools and I've talked

950
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,160
about this over and over again you have

951
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,920
to have those coupled with being

952
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,000
cautious on some of the foods that will

953
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,400
feed a problem the one thing you're

954
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,480
going to get with the medical medium

955
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,480
food is you're going to get lots of

956
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,480
it lots of

957
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:39,079
it have you ever known medical

958
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,880

959
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:43,440

and mental metal implants trigger mental

998
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,520
health episodes as well psychosis and

999
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,400
similar breakdowns maybe months later

1000
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,119
would that be more immediate it could be

1001
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,079
some immediate and months later and

1002
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:45,960
years

1003
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,119
later and that's why we have to take

1004
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,040
care of ourselves have those

1005
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:53,480
foundational tools and do the healing we

1006
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,480
need to do and move

1007
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,280
forward so I know a lot of people are

1008
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,599
freaking out and you'll see that on

1009
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,240
social everybody's just freaking out

1010
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:05,359
about like you'll see it out

1011
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,359
there food chemicals food

1012
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:12,040
chemicals food chemicals are bad I've

1013
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,160
talked about them in all the books

1014
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,400
processed

1015
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:20,359
foods it's not why everybody is getting

1016
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,000
dangerously sick and sick and sicker

1017
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:25,200
it's not unfortunately that's not the

1018
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,480
reason I know they're looking for stuff

1019
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,200
like that but what you'll see the

1020
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,680
industries do is you'll see them

1021
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,319
still hide from the pathogens and the

1022
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,520
metals see little bit of the metal stuff

1023
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,319
creep up because they're learning the

1024
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,920
medical medium information right all the

1025
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:44,280
metal information I put all these years

1026
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,880
but you'll see them skirt around the

1027
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,920
pathogens once again and they'll try to

1028
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,720
just look for these other you know

1029
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,000
things and they'll try to do shock and

1030
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,119
awe this food chemical this die number

1031
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,400
three this die here this thing

1032
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,559
here you're going to see a lot of that

1033
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,920
why everybody's looking for reasons why

1034
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:07,400
people are sick and at the same time

1035
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,960
whether it's accidental it's accidental

1036
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,680
or purposely could be accidental they're

1037
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,599
not seeing the real reasons why people

1038
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,599
are sick and

1039
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,280
suffering so one problem with the flu

1040
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:25,839
and the Sea that's coming again over and

1041
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:29,640
over again the RSV and the neuro

1042
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,640
virus and the

1043
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:39,319
SS and all the other different ones like

1044
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:42,079
the bird bugs the problem with all these

1045
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:44,200
is if you don't have your foundations

1046
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,800
intact and you're not cleaning out some

1047
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,000
of the garbage getting some of the

1048
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,160
metals out knocking back some of the

1049
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,559
pathogens it becomes too much of an

1050
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,760
overload too much of an overload

1051
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,000
2025 going to be a year where we're

1052
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,040
going to get a wave a bunch waves of a

1053
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,040
lot of bugs going to be coming

1054
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,559
through and people aren't taking care of

1055
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,160
themselves properly and knocking down

1056
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:11,559
the bugs that they have in them living

1057
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,480
in them all the time and that's the

1058
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:17,200
perfect

1059
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:19,800
storm for all that stuff Uma a w where

1060
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,920
have you been okay okay okay

1061
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,440

ready I'm only going to squeak out an

1063
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,640
inkling of this information right here

1064
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:33,880
and inkling of this

1065
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,880
information okay if you're

1066
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,680

1067
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,839
been asking for Spiritual information

1068
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,040
from

1069
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:45,319
me you guys I don't know you guys

1070
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,200

1071
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:49,720

you

1075
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:58,680

that's going to happen in

1078
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,359
2025

1079
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,640
and I got something else that's going to

1080
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:12,400
happen in

1081
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:16,359
2025 and I just hope I hope to

1082
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,359
God that I did the right

1083
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,800
thing

1084
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:28,040
by putting in

1085
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,040

1086
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,079
um

1087
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:40,960
information that comes from

1088
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,960
so that's going to answer a lot of

1089
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,000
questions about a lot of things and I

1090
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,200
know I sound kind of hesitant right now

1091
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,040
and kind of reserved and I'm like

1092
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:56,319
talking in like cryptic

1093
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,760
code but holy crap do I have something

1094
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:02,760
