00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:48,560
that as of today there are no sources of

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,159
tattoo ink that are free of toxic heavy

56
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,599
metals and as of today there are no

57
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,280
tattoo inks free of metals but I know

58
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,800
there's some people out there that are

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,519
just going to say no way not my ink I

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,319
know cuz I got the assurance that my ink

61
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,840
was

62
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:10,840
crueltyfree crueltyfree and not to

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,760
mention my ink was vegan and crueltyfree

64
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,599
so there's no way that's not my ink I'm

65
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,440
going to listen to the show but this

66
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:22,959
isn't me I repeat there are no tattoo

67
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,159
inks available out there without metals

68
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,360
and there's something else you might

69
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,080
want to know there is a certain

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,280
percentage of ingredients inside the

71
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,920
tattoo ink

72
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,599
that do not have to be exposed and do

73
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,560
not have to be

74
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,640
disclosed just like in food products

75
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,080
they can have a certain small percentage

76
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,840
of ingredients chemicals and so forth

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,519
all kinds of different ingredients that

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,400
do not have to be disclosed and just

79
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,159
like

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,079
supplementation same thing you could

81
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,200
have a certain amount a certain

82
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,519
percentage of ingredients that are

83
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,599
hidden not disclosed to the public or

84
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,640
the consumer that are in there and

85
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,879
nobody knows about will tell tattoo ink

86
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,840
is the same these days there are people

87
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,760
out there that are really careful about

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,040
what they eat careful about what they

89
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,040
drink making sure that if they drink

90
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,599
coffee it's the best stuff out there

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,639
like they even know the Farms like there

92
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,160
are people out there that are crazy

93
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,120
about what's going on what they put on

94
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,639
their body they're concerned whatever

95
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,400
kind of cream whatever kind of facial

96
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,759
they get whatever it is they're all

97
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,360
about I don't put things in my body that

98
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,720
that shouldn't be there meanwhile

99
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,479
they'll be getting a tattoo and those

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,160
are the kind of people that if they want

101
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,000
a tattoo they're asking questions like

102
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,120
is this tattoo good is it clean is it

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,880
crueltyfree and the place they're

104
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,880
getting it be like yeah here's our best

105
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,800
inks here's what it is and it's like

106
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,039
great I feel good about this put it in

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,520
my body and that ink is not free of

108
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:00,080
heavy metals and that ink is not free of

109
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,240
toxins and that ink is not free of metal

110
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,080
s is that ink better than the ink 30

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,160
years ago probably is the ink better

112
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,160
than the ink they used 50 years ago yeah

113
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,000
definitely but how much better is it not

114
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,680
that much better and then there's the

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,120
people that are afraid to speak up no

116
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,479
judgment no anything like that but

117
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,759
they're afraid to speak up so they go

118
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,800
get a tattoo they don't want to tell

119
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,800
that tattoo artist anything they don't

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,880
want to say hey can you use this ink or

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,120
what's your ink made out of they're just

122
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,720
afraid they could have been recommended

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,680
to the place from a friend and there

124
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,840
could be a huge waiting list because the

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
tattoo artist is amazing really good at

126
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,199
what they do they could have traveled

127
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,080
across the country around the world

128
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,680
could be this one guy in

129
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,120
La this one person in La it could be

130
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,199
anybody and they go and they're there

131
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,280
and they're not going to say anything

132
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:01,039
just sign the dotted line just put it in

133
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,960
boom and then then there's the sanitary

134
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,919
issues the sanitary issues that are at

135
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,039
hand literally on the

136
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,639
hand now I know that tattoo artists they

137
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,160
change their gloves they're not using

138
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,479
the same pair of gloves each person and

139
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,720
you'll never see a tattoo artist wear

140
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,960
white gloves and you'll never see a

141
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,039
tattoo artist wear blue gloves they wear

142
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,680
black gloves the reason why it'll look

143
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,520
like a murder scene now blood is really

144
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,840
tricky tends to get everywhere

145
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,000
it's not even like water water doesn't

146
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,680
get everywhere that's how crazy it is

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,520
blood tends to get everywhere because

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,759
blood is slippery it's got a

149
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,000
viscosity and micro drops go everywhere

150
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,840
so when someone's getting a tattoo the

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,240
micro drops are flying you don't see

152
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:57,039
them it's hard to see them they don't

153
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,960
leave a stain but they fly now there's a

154
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,319
good chance your tattoo artist is just

155
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,720
going to change gloves between clients

156
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,759
and those gloves are laced with blood

157
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,080
the client's blood now you would think

158
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,160
it's Flawless nothing bad could happen

159
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,560
the guy or the girl takes off their

160
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,280
gloves throws them away in the

161
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,560
biowaste but if you took a blue light

162
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,360
over everything you would see blood in

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,400
weird places you would see it on the

164
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,560
table you'd see it on the floor you'd

165
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,080
see it on the chair you'd see it on the

166
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,960
box they're drawing new gloves from the

167
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,319
very box that has brand new gloves you

168
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,639
would see it even on that box but of

169
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,599
course you get a brand new set of

170
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,520
needles for your tattoo and years past

171
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,520
you wouldn't get a set of new needles it

172
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,159
would be the same needles it would just

173
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,319
be needles that went through a

174
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,199
sterilizer the guy would walk up to the

175
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,759
incubator sterilization machine open up

176
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,479
the door pull a brand new needle out not

177
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,440
a brand new needle out an old needle

178
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,199
that was used before 100 times take it

179
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,520
out say it was

180
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,479
sterilized attach it to the gun and get

181
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,199
to work there are millions of people

182
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,680
that had their tattoos done that way and

183
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,280
have transmitted a lot of different bugs

184
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,400
because of it

185
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,520
viruses bacteria but it's changed now

186
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,599
it's brand new needles in brand new

187
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,879
packages but what hasn't changed is

188
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,599
other forms of

189
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,399
contamination tiny blood smears tiny

190
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,839
blood drops everywhere any friends that

191
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,039
I have that want to get a tattoo or have

192
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,919
tattoos and want to get another tattoo I

193
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,240
tell them be the first client of the day

194
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,000
don't be the second don't be the last if

195
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,240
I was going to get a tattoo I would

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,320
bring a brand new set of gloves better

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,000
than that I would bring a box my own box

198
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,240
of gloves then I would make sure I was

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,200
the first person

200
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,399
and it was after the tattoo artist had a

201
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,200
day off this allows for any kind of germ

202
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,320
warfare any kind of pathogens viruses

203
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,320
bacteria that could be from other

204
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,959
people's blood that could be left

205
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,839
anywhere anywhere at all in the tattoo

206
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,880
parlor gives it a chance for there to be

207
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,680
a die off several years ago I was in a

208
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,959
tattoo parlor with a friend my friend

209
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,600
asked me to be there wanted me to be

210
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,399
there while he was getting a tattoo so I

211
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,560
was watching everything so the tattoo

212
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,160
artist grabbed some fresh gloves put

213
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,440
them on his hands looked at me and said

214
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,240
is this good he was being sarcastic cuz

215
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,680
he knew I was there to just keep an eye

216
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,920
on things cuz my friend said so so I was

217
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,160
watching everything he also grabbed some

218
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,320
new needles brand new needles he opened

219
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,519
them up and he made a joke too at the

220
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,120
same time but he grabbed the new needles

221
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,240
unpackaged them put them in the gun he

222
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,079
also told me how much he s paralyzed the

223
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,320
place he started to work on my friend he

224
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,680
was doing the tattoo everything was

225
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,040
going pretty good I was sitting there

226
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:16,560
okay not bad and then I saw him he took

227
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,320
his right hand and He adjusted his stool

228
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,000
there was a little handle on his stool

229
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,279
and because each client had a different

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,240
height different weight different size

231
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,399
person he would have to get himself

232
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,079
comfortable position himself just right

233
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:36,120
and he would have to adjust his stool

234
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,959
and then he had blood from this client

235
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,360
which was my friend on his glove and

236
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,760
then he reached over with the hand that

237
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,480
had my friend's blood on it and grabbed

238
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,120
the handle to the stool and then I said

239
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,040
wait a

240
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,320
minute hold on here wait a minute and I

241
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,880
had to give a

242
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:02,240
101 to a highly experienced tattoo

243
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,800
artist famous is in La who's worked on

244
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,440
everybody I said was that stool

245
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,600
sterilized and he said no I said was a

246
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,320
handle to that stool sterilized he said

247
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,279
no I said you touch that on every client

248
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,680
he said yeah I told my friend this is

249
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,839
why you got to be the first client of

250
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,279
the day and this is why it should be

251
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,760
after a day or two off that the tattoo

252
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,720
artist had maybe if the tattoo artist

253
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,000
took the weekend off then it's Monday

254
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,959
morning first client this way way you'll

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,279
have a better chance for whatever was on

256
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:40,079
that stool handle could have had time to

257
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:43,120
die off and this isn't Ironclad so the

258
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,160
artist sterilized the chair sterilized a

259
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,760
stool did some extra sterilizing

260
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,079
everywhere else did some alcohol rubs in

261
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,800
different places and then of course

262
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:57,120
changed out the gloves and changed out

263
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,959
the gun because he was touching the gun

264
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,200
after touching the stool then touching

265
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,440
the gun and put some new needles into my

266
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,320
friend he was happy with his Polar Bear

267
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,120
tattoo I have to admit came out freaking

268
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,040
amazing almost made me want to get one

269
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,360
but I didn't but I still told my friend

270
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,760
just because the ink was crty free and

271
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,480
vegan it didn't mean it was metal free

272
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,000
or hidden toxin free my friend was

273
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,240
bummed out to hear about the metal part

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,880
but he was happy it was crueltyfree and

275
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,440
I said you know that's good because they

276
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:36,760
didn't experiment or torture the animals

277
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,279
in the world to make your tattoo ink

278
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,639
what people don't know is that without

279
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,240
the toxic heavy metals or Metals at all

280
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:49,199
inside the tattoo ink you can't get the

281
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,360
pop the shine you need Metals inside the

282
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:56,519
ink so that when the sunlight hits your

283
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,839
skin it reflects off the metals without

284
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,399
Metals in the ink any light hitting your

285
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,800
skin your arm your body your back your

286
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,079
chest your face your neck you won't be

287
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,240
able to see the tattoo it won't be clear

288
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,720
it won't be fresh it won't pop it won't

289
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,880
have vibrancy you have to have Metals in

290
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,279
there so when light hits at any kind of

291
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,279
light the light inside your room the

292
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,399
light inside your car the light inside a

293
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:23,279
restaurant wherever the light is the

294
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,680
light in the sky it has to hit the metal

295
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,399
it has to reflect and then you see it

296
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,279
that's why a brand new tattoo really

297
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,560
pops it really showcases it really

298
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,680
exhibits itself the newer the tattoo the

299
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,480
better the display and then over time

300
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,320
the tattoo fades it could take years

301
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:49,519
it's very slow but it fades and as it's

302
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:51,000
fading the metals are leaving that could

303
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,519
be a good thing right the metals are

304
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,880
leaving but wait they're not leaving

305
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,279
they're staying they're just shifting

306
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,759
their location they're entering your

307
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,720
bloodstream they're entering your

308
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,759
lymphatic system they're entering both

309
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,160
and from there they take a nice little

310
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,279
trip into the liver they stay in there

311
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,880
as long as they can until they get

312
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,519
overloaded and they leave the liver and

313
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,079
they head to the brain as these Metals

314
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,040
leave the Derma and they leave your

315
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,040
tattoo it's the wild west some of the

316
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,240
metals may not even go to your liver

317
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,199
they'll just go straight to your brain

318
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,959
but they never ever leave your

319
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:32,759
bloodstream and leave your kidneys and

320
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,320
leave you unless you're doing something

321
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,480
proactive we'll talk about that later

322
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,560
having a tattoo and having that tattoo

323
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,680
ink in the Derma of your skin is

324
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,680
different than drinking something like

325
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,639
so say you drink something that has

326
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,040
toxic heavy metals in it there might be

327
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,000
a tiny percentage a small portion of

328
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,519
those metals that might leave your body

329
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,120
through your urine and the reason for

330
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,000
that is because those metals were never

331
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,839
in your body they never had a long time

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,040
to sit inside your body they've never

333
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,360
conformed they've never changed they've

334
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,519
never altered while in your body they're

335
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,880
fresh they're in the drink or something

336
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,839
you're eating they go in your body it's

337
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,040
brand new your body excretes some of it

338
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,360
out keeps most of it but still excretes

339
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,560
some of it out the metals in your

340
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,240
tattooing though that's sitting in you

341
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,600
for one year 5 years 10 years has

342
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,120
started to oxidize it's not the same

343
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,160
thing as it was when it went in you for

344
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,959
one it has a different weight to it for

345
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,800
two your body has identified it over the

346
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:37,160
years learn to live with it your body's

347
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,279
not in a rush to eliminate it it's not

348
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,079
thinking it needs to your immune system

349
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:46,920
has learned to coexist with it it's not

350
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:50,199
in a rush or any desire to eliminate it

351
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,639
or get rid of it or help carry it out

352
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:57,079
our immune systems are designed to

353
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:00,199
gobble up fresh threats fresh toxins

354
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:03,160
fresh Metals things that it sees as a

355
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,560
threat but the metals inside and the

356
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,839
toxins inside the ink that's in your arm

357
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,079
for a long time our immune system has

358
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,519
learned to cohabitate with it as these

359
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,399
oxidized Metals leech out of your Derma

360
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,759
into your bloodstream there isn't a bell

361
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,120
whistling there isn't a massive red flag

362
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,199
your body's not alarmed your body has

363
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,680
coexisted with it for a long time

364
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,639
there's no rush to push it out there's

365
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,279
no Avenue to send it out

366
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,720
it's Wild West it's free it's clear and

367
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,000
it's heading where it wants to go

368
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,160
another reason why your body's not in a

369
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,480
rush to get rid of the toxic heavy

370
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,160
metals from the tattoo ink that's

371
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,160
leeching out of your Derma into the

372
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,759
bloodstream and another reason why your

373
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:53,360
immune system isn't in a rush either is

374
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:56,680
because it's been time relased slow and

375
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,120
steady slow and steady and that's how it

376
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,600
goes every year every day every decade a

377
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,280
little bit at a time there's no alarm

378
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,160
Bells being rung just a little bit at a

379
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,480
time coming out and that's why the body

380
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,919
is not in any any emergency or rush to

381
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,000
rid it but as the years go by the tattoo

382
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,799
starts to fade maybe because you're

383
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,079
thinking well that's what it's supposed

384
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:27,880
to do right supposed to fade it was done

385
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:31,799
many years ago you grow older no it's

386
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:35,600
supposed to be just as shiny and nice as

387
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:37,760
the day you got it because it's not

388
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,200
supposed to have metal in there it's

389
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,120
supposed to have some new form of

390
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,799
technology that they'll discover 30

391
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,360
years down the road 50 years down the

392
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,799
road that never Fades that isn't a toxic

393
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,559
heavy metal something they'll create in

394
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,799
a lab somewhere but right now it's the

395
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:57,480
metals and they fade because they leave

396
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,640
time relased they dissipate they go away

397
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,720
as the years go on and you're left with

398
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,880
a faded tattoo and as the light from the

399
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,360
sun or light from the light in your room

400
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,240
or light from anywhere hits your arm

401
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:15,159
hits your leg hit your back hit your

402
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:18,039
neck it doesn't pop anymore the metals

403
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:21,120
are leaving it doesn't reflect against

404
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:24,360
the metal as much anymore if you already

405
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,919
have tattoos don't have to remove them

406
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,280
instead you can follow medical medium

407
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,440
protocols to stop up and expel the

408
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,640
metals as they're being time relased out

409
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,919
of your Derma into your blood and lymph

410
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,159
this way over time the metals don't keep

411
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,679
on building up inside your brain if

412
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,039
you're somebody that doesn't like their

413
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,000
tattoo anymore and they want it gone

414
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,240
they want to remove it I don't recommend

415
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,600
that because the procedure could release

416
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,799
more toxic heavy metals more toxins into

417
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,559
your blood and lymph faster heavier I

418
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,720
prefer just leaving them on people keep

419
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,080
them don't worry about it unless you

420
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,760
really want them removed and if you do

421
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,799
then really you should be following the

422
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,000
heavy metal detox Guidance the medical

423
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,120
medium books brain saver if anybody has

424
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,559
a tattoo remember the metals slowly

425
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,240
leech out of the Derma into your system

426
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,400
your blood your lymph your brain your

427
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,440
liver your spleen your pancreas your

428
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,679
bones so it's always best to do the

429
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,679
right

430
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,919

yeah yeah cuz the metal it's

442
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,960
industrialized that's the kind of metal

443
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
they put in us it's different than the

444
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,559
minerals and trace minerals that are in

445
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,960

get get undercover

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,640
okay something to understand that when

455
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,720
we get tattoos we're putting a lot of

456
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,000
metal under our skin this isn't metal

457
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,240
like minerals trace minerals from the

458
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,880
plants we eat from the food that we eat

459
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,840
from the water we drink these are

460
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,760
manufactured metals that are inside the

461
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,760
tattoo inks they're destabilized they're

462
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,280
industrialized it's not like the plants

463
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,400
we eat the food wheat it's not the same

464
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,240
trace minerals inside our body it's not

465
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,640
the trace minerals that actually help us

466
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
function it's not the electrolytes that

467
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,600
are in our

468
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,880
bloodstream when you're playing a game

469
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,200
of golf and a thunderstorm comes and you

470
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,760
see some lightning bolts in the distance

471
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,360
you're holding a golf club you know you

472
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,640
have to put it away and head back it's

473
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,000
not that you have to be afraid or scared

474
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,760
of a lightning storm thunderstorm more

475
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,520
so than anybody else but it's something

476
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,600
to keep in mind

477
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,720
because the lightning tends to find

478
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,919
metal it looks for lamp posts it looks

479
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,039
for fence posts it looks for metal

480
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,919
objects it looks for metal lawn chairs

481
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,840
it looks for metal gates it looks for

482
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,760
all kinds of different varieties of

483
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,919
metal sticking out of the ground and it

484
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,520
looks for metal roofs lightning tends to

485
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,120
search and

486
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,279
seek just like someone doesn't want to

487
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,840
go into a lightning storm wrapped in

488
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,279
aluminum foil you just don't want to do

489
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,799
it someone doesn't want to go into a

490
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:08,120
lightning storm holding a golf club in

491
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,720
the air it's not about having fear it's

492
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,279
not about being scared it's just about

493
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,120
being proactive and careful lightning

494
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,360
storm coming your way Thunder's going

495
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,919

496
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,880
Ink on you and in you just be careful

497
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:28,159
try to get cover protect yourself be

498
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,600
aware be smart about it that's all these

499
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,000
are just just some of the things to

500
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,720
consider if you have tattoos or you plan

501
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,520
on getting tattoos or you have tattoos

502
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,360
and you plan on getting more

503
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,840
tattoos I've been bringing awareness

504
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,200
about Metals being in tattoos for

505
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,360
decades now here's a recent clip of a

506
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,279
social media live stream I did in 2022

507
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,520
March 16th where I talk about tattoo ink

508
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,960
and metals inside of it so with brain

509
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,320
fog you can have metal sprinkled

510
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,760
about so you're what like where do I get

511
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,919
Mercury and all these metals like where

512
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,120
does it come from well I noticed a lot

513
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,520
of people like tattoos these days a lot

514
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,080
of people like ink these days and I'm

515
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,919
not against getting ink at all if you

516
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,480
got ink don't get it

517
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,000
removed you know I mean if you have ink

518
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,600
it's fine it's fine but what people

519
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,480
don't realize is that's a huge one for

520
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,159
toxic heavy metals that's why the heavy

521
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,120
metal detox cleanse is so important

522
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,640
that's why the heavy metal detox

523
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:33,400
smoothie is so important because it's

524
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,960
that there's no heavy metal free ink so

525
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,760
when you get when someone's like hey I

526
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,039
know this great tattoo parlor I know

527
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,799

528
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:47,600
crueltyfree ink they use animal

529
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:50,799
crueltyfree ink it's vegan it's vegan

530
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,440
ink it's filled with metal you can't

531
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,720
have it any other way and I'll tell you

532
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,279
why when you get your

533
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,679

544
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,760
it is that you choose to get you see the

545
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,840
rose it pops when light hits it right

546
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,200
when it's in your arm and the only way

547
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,760
that can happen is if that ink is filled

548
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,960
with metal that's the reflective nature

549
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,279
of the ink so what happens is when light

550
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,960
goes into your

551
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,200
Derma anything light any kind of light

552
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,720
not sunlight any kind of light goes

553
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,320
through your Derma it hits the ink and

554
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:52,720
it reflects back

555
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:56,039
out that's how you get that pop so when

556
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,240
you walk out of a tattoo parlor and the

557
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:02,320
dude there or whoever gave a

558
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,080
tattoo they said it was animal Cru

559
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,039
cruelty free ink maybe it was animal

560
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,720
cruelty free free ink but it's not heavy

561
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:12,679
metal free ink because the metals make

562
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,320
it so you can see it and so here's how

563
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,919
it works as the metals go into your

564
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,960
bloodstream every day from there on out

565
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,159
and they go to your brain over time as

566
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,960
the metals travel into your bloodstream

567
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:30,320
and get to your brain over time okay

568
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,880
your your tattoo f Fades it's not fading

569
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,960
because you're getting

570
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,640
older it's not fading because you've had

571
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,799
the tattoo for 10 years or 15 years 20

572
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,360
years it's fading because all the metal

573
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:45,720
is slowly leaving through your Derma

574
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,120
that pass through your Derma into your

575
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,440
bloodstream and ends up in your

576
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,080
liver and ends up in your brain that's

577
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,559
where it's going right and it's not

578
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,559
about getting them removed it's about

579
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,279
just being proactive and catching the

580
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,480

581
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:05,520
