[50.56 - 55.56] about medical medium information to
[52.60 - 58.52] Major media outlets in hopes that it
[55.56 - 61.36] would lead to securing themselves a deal

[217.28 - 222.40] practitioner and speech pathologist and
[219.84 - 225.48] was a friend of Stephanie's her name is
[222.40 - 227.64] Dr Kimberly spare Kim and her husband
[225.48 - 230.68] supported Stephanie at the time of her
[227.64 - 233.20] illness back in 2020 Ashley posted her
[230.68 - 235.92] original false story about Stephanie
[233.20 - 239.04] which she made more than 15 false claims
[235.92 - 241.68] in one version of and told more than 20
[239.04 - 243.76] falsehoods in another version of
[241.68 - 245.76] Kimberly's husband corrected Ashley in
[243.76 - 248.36] the comments on something she'd gotten
[245.76 - 251.32] very wrong and Ashley had to adjust her
[248.36 - 253.68] false story because of it Kimberly made
[251.32 - 256.24] a statement to her own small private
[253.68 - 259.16] Community to calm fears and Chaos that
[256.24 - 261.64] Ashley had created with her false story
[259.16 - 263.96] Ashley was not happy about this and she
[261.64 - 267.12] responded by attacking Kim and trying to
[263.96 - 269.52] intimidate her to this day Ashley has
[267.12 - 272.20] continued to publicly attack Kimberly
[269.52 - 274.52] and and her family Kimberly thank you
[272.20 - 276.24] for coming on to share your story I know
[274.52 - 278.60] that the situation has been extremely
[276.24 - 281.52] upsetting thank you Amber this is a
[278.60 - 283.56] really sad situation a dear friend that
[281.52 - 285.48] I cared about is being used for an
[283.56 - 287.96] agenda that seems to have been created
[285.48 - 289.88] years after her passing I would have
[287.96 - 292.40] never shared the intimate details of her
[289.88 - 295.28] story because Stephanie's privacy is my
[292.40 - 297.52] number one concern however the plotters
[295.28 - 300.08] have shared very intimate details of
[297.52 - 303.40] Stephanie's story and even delic get
[300.08 - 305.68] unnecessary details about her life I was
[303.40 - 308.92] recently attacked and have been
[305.68 - 311.12] continually attacked since 2020 the
[308.92 - 314.24] attacks were sudden they were out of the
[311.12 - 316.60] blue I was actually really shocked when
[314.24 - 318.84] they began I felt it was really
[316.60 - 320.00] necessary for me to set a few things
[318.84 - 323.84] straight here
[320.00 - 326.20] today yeah could you start Kim by
[323.84 - 328.00] telling us first about your relationship
[326.20 - 331.64] with Stephanie and how you were
[328.00 - 335.36] supporting her when she was SI
[331.64 - 337.68] yeah so we met actually at Ashley's home
[335.36 - 340.16] during the LA medical medium event
[337.68 - 342.28] Stephanie and I became instant friends
[340.16 - 344.20] we realized that we lived just one state
[342.28 - 347.04] over from each other and that she had a
[344.20 - 350.48] nephew that was very close and age to my
[347.04 - 353.88] son we started texting and voice texting
[350.48 - 356.32] a lot Stephanie was sweet she was funny
[353.88 - 358.96] she was loving and she was always
[356.32 - 361.64] looking for advice but she was also
[358.96 - 364.20] always offering to help in any way that
[361.64 - 366.20] she could I would meet up with Stephanie
[364.20 - 368.84] for lunch at the grocery store juice
[366.20 - 371.12] bars and I met up with her the night
[368.84 - 372.48] that her niece was born at the hospital
[371.12 - 374.16] to arm her with the things that she
[372.48 - 375.08] wanted to support her sister-in-law
[374.16 - 377.92] through
[375.08 - 379.88] Labor a few months later I met her
[377.92 - 382.36] sister-in-law niece and nephew for a
[379.88 - 384.36] lunch date and we bounced together along
[382.36 - 387.80] with her family and my family at her
[384.36 - 390.24] nephew's birthday party Stephanie was so
[387.80 - 391.72] so proud of rise and nephew
[390.24 - 393.68] and wanted me to be friends with her
[391.72 - 395.52] sister-in-law because she thought we had
[393.68 - 398.40] so much in common and we had kids that
[395.52 - 400.12] were really close in age I adored
[398.40 - 402.88] Stephanie and the friendship that we
[400.12 - 405.88] shared I soon became pregnant with my
[402.88 - 407.92] second child and Stephanie volunteered
[405.88 - 410.64] to help me postpartum with my 2-year-old
[407.92 - 413.00] son the same way that she supported her
[410.64 - 415.08] sister-in-law and her nephew because she
[413.00 - 416.88] told me I helped to support her and her
[415.08 - 419.24] brother and her brother's family
[416.88 - 423.12] postpartum and that I also needed that
[419.24 - 425.60] same help she was always so gentle so
[423.12 - 427.76] kind and always questioned how I was
[425.60 - 430.76] working full-time how I was pregnant and
[427.76 - 433.12] also caring for a 2-year-old she got it
[430.76 - 436.28] and it meant so much to
[433.12 - 438.12] me when Stephanie got sick I remember
[436.28 - 440.16] discussing doctors with her and offering
[438.12 - 443.40] to go with her into the City and hold
[440.16 - 446.28] her hand but Stephanie was not receptive
[443.40 - 450.04] to the idea of seeing a doctor at that
[446.28 - 451.40] time wow and then what was was happening
[450.04 - 454.96] and what were things like after
[451.40 - 457.64] Stephanie got sick so this was really
[454.96 - 460.36] hard when Stephanie took a turn for the
[457.64 - 463.28] worst I was getting ready to birth my
[460.36 - 465.04] baby I was planning a vack birth as my
[463.28 - 467.56] first birth was a traumatic emergency
[465.04 - 469.72] birth and the stress of what I'm about
[467.56 - 473.48] to explain was impacting my ability to
[469.72 - 475.80] birth my baby I was under so much
[473.48 - 477.80] pressure and I was having such a hard
[475.80 - 480.44] time shifting into birth mode as I was
[477.80 - 482.48] on constant group messages with then
[480.44 - 484.56] friends colleagues medical doctors
[482.48 - 488.40] consultants and personally with
[484.56 - 491.24] Stephanie to support her as best I could
[488.40 - 493.80] the pressure was never ever from
[491.24 - 497.04] Stephanie it was coming from several of
[493.80 - 499.36] the plotters mostly Ashley who lived
[497.04 - 501.76] across the country they were looking at
[499.36 - 503.52] a map and telling me that I live an hour
[501.76 - 506.20] and 20 minutes from Stephanie but in
[503.52 - 508.20] reality with City traffic this
[506.20 - 511.60] oftentimes could take up to four hours
[508.20 - 513.76] each way this is why when Stephanie and
[511.60 - 516.00] I did meet up before she was sick we
[513.76 - 517.96] were always extremely strategic about
[516.00 - 519.04] our planning the city traffic where we
[517.96 - 521.48] live is
[519.04 - 524.28] horrendous and the driving around here
[521.48 - 528.32] during the city traffic it's it's just
[524.28 - 530.44] crazy so back to my birth I was
[528.32 - 533.52] literally in the birthing tub birthing
[530.44 - 536.08] my baby on text threads with Stephanie
[533.52 - 537.84] and with her supporters several of which
[536.08 - 540.80] are now involved in trying to take this
[537.84 - 543.56] community down when I finally birthed my
[540.80 - 545.88] baby I was back on the text threads
[543.56 - 548.24] within minutes planning how I could best
[545.88 - 551.40] support Stephanie this was before my
[548.24 - 554.08] family or my son had even met my new
[551.40 - 556.12] daughter I was under so much pressure
[554.08 - 558.28] before I was even cleared to drive by my
[556.12 - 560.88] midwives I was back on my feet caring
[558.28 - 562.44] for my newborn caring for my 2-year-old
[560.88 - 565.04] and driving food and teas and
[562.44 - 568.40] supplements that Stephanie wanted to her
[565.04 - 570.68] whenever I could Stephanie herself did
[568.40 - 573.28] not want me doing this but the platters
[570.68 - 575.80] continued to push me like I was some
[573.28 - 578.64] type of robot that should birth a baby
[575.80 - 581.20] and then be back to running around I
[578.64 - 584.80] also opened up my home to a house guest
[581.20 - 588.00] when I was only a few weeks postpartum a
[584.80 - 590.12] friend Gretchen she came to my house and
[588.00 - 592.76] stayed with me so that she could support
[590.12 - 596.20] Stephanie my husband and I gave up a car
[592.76 - 597.48] we ran arands on no sleep we also opened
[596.20 - 599.76] our home to
[597.48 - 601.84] illness as Gretchen was in and out of
[599.76 - 604.08] the hospital and then back in our home
[601.84 - 606.64] around my newborn we all came down with
[604.08 - 609.28] a flu when my baby was just a few weeks
[606.64 - 611.76] old my two-year-old was also sick it was
[609.28 - 614.76] one of the hardest experiences of my
[611.76 - 617.96] life being postpartum having a baby
[614.76 - 620.60] being exposed to a flu on one trip to
[617.96 - 624.64] pick up Gretchen again before I was
[620.60 - 627.84] cleared to drive I was so tired that I
[624.64 - 630.76] went to pump gas near Stephanie's home
[627.84 - 634.00] the gas station was old and the pump was
[630.76 - 636.72] malfunctioning and I was
[634.00 - 639.36] exhausted I grabbed the noob nozzle and
[636.72 - 642.48] I pressed it a few times before it
[639.36 - 646.24] turned on soaking me in gasoline my hair
[642.48 - 649.12] was soaked my clothes were soaked I was
[646.24 - 652.48] drenched from head to toe I was sprayed
[649.12 - 655.64] in the eyes and I felt like I couldn't
[652.48 - 658.56] breathe I was shaking from the freezing
[655.64 - 661.68] temperatures my newborn she was in the
[658.56 - 664.36] back seat breathing in all the
[661.68 - 667.04] fumes I rushed to Stephanie's house with
[664.36 - 669.76] my windows down freezing
[667.04 - 672.44] shaking and I had to shower and wear
[669.76 - 676.16] someone else's clothes home the whole
[672.44 - 680.72] time period it was totally
[676.16 - 683.28] insane I had a baby a baby a newborn
[680.72 - 687.36] that was just a few weeks old and a
[683.28 - 689.92] 2-year-old son and I was being pushed by
[687.36 - 693.28] women across the country mostly at asley
[689.92 - 695.36] to do more and more I had already been
[693.28 - 697.64] supporting Stephanie in every way that I
[695.36 - 699.44] could I had given her money I had
[697.64 - 701.20] purchased supplements that she wanted
[699.44 - 703.00] and couldn't afford I was cooking her
[701.20 - 705.20] meals when I could bringing her teas
[703.00 - 706.96] when I could my husband even took food
[705.20 - 708.72] to the hospital at one point just days
[706.96 - 711.32] after my daughter was
[708.72 - 713.08] born he felt extremely uncomfortable in
[711.32 - 715.04] the hospital as Stephanie wanted to talk
[713.08 - 717.24] to him and welcome the food but he felt
[715.04 - 720.56] so mixed up in a situation where some of
[717.24 - 723.84] the plotters were screaming at at her
[720.56 - 725.88] family one of the platters Taylor was
[723.84 - 727.68] attacking Stephanie's father having a
[725.88 - 729.96] heated discussion while disagreeing with
[727.68 - 732.76] Stephanie's father about her
[729.96 - 734.68] treatment my husband during those days
[732.76 - 736.56] was rushing home from work so that he or
[734.68 - 738.60] I could run things we could move cars we
[736.56 - 741.20] could run errands we could manage house
[738.60 - 743.56] guests cook meals run guests back and
[741.20 - 746.16] forth with a baby and a two-year-old I
[743.56 - 748.68] wanted to do everything for
[746.16 - 751.00] Stephanie but Ashley was creating a
[748.68 - 751.92] pressure on that almost broke me during
[751.00 - 753.68] that
[751.92 - 757.96] time
[753.68 - 760.72] wow there's so much to unpack here from
[757.96 - 763.40] this story and it sounds like such an
[760.72 - 766.96] unbelievably stressful and traumatic
[763.40 - 768.36] time having gasoline sprayed all over
[766.96 - 770.08] your body like that when your body's
[768.36 - 773.16] already compromised from having just
[770.08 - 775.28] given birth let alone when your
[773.16 - 778.32] breastfeeding it's a
[775.28 - 779.68] tremendous exposure I can't even imagine
[778.32 - 782.76] I would have been
[779.68 - 785.08] devastated and despite having just given
[782.76 - 786.76] birth you and your husband were both
[785.08 - 789.40] doing the best that you could to help
[786.76 - 792.64] Stephanie while she was sick you weren't
[789.40 - 796.12] cleared to even drive yet and you did it
[792.64 - 797.92] anyway the drive wasn't short I want to
[796.12 - 800.32] bring in a text that we have from
[797.92 - 802.92] Stephanie she had sent it to a friend
[800.32 - 804.72] this was from before she had gotten sick
[802.92 - 806.64] and she was talking about some items
[804.72 - 809.92] that she was thinking about picking up
[806.64 - 812.24] from you and she says okay cool she
[809.92 - 813.80] isn't super close so may not get it
[812.24 - 817.16] unless it's super
[813.80 - 819.24] important this text corroborates this
[817.16 - 820.96] text from Stephanie corroborates the
[819.24 - 823.20] fact that you were far enough away from
[820.96 - 825.56] her that it would have been a hassle for
[823.20 - 827.36] her to pick up items from your house if
[825.56 - 829.52] they weren't super
[827.36 - 831.48] important you said that your husband
[829.52 - 834.16] brought food to the hospital and spent
[831.48 - 836.32] time around the family you both were
[834.16 - 838.40] actually there and you got to witness
[836.32 - 842.44] what was going on in person when
[838.40 - 844.28] Stephanie was sick as Ashley mainly was
[842.44 - 848.24] putting all of this pressure on you to
[844.28 - 850.44] do more and more I'm wondering where was
[848.24 - 853.12] Ashley and what was Ashley doing during
[850.44 - 856.16] the year and a half that Stephanie was
[853.12 - 859.08] sick I have actually been to Ashley's
[856.16 - 861.56] family home in Pebble Beach California
[859.08 - 865.48] but at the time I didn't know how well
[861.56 - 867.72] off she was she was actually in Malibu
[865.48 - 870.00] while Stephanie was sick she kept saying
[867.72 - 872.28] she was very far away
[870.00 - 874.96] I now wonder why she didn't offer
[872.28 - 878.96] Stephanie more support or come to see
[874.96 - 881.72] her she very well had the means to do it
[878.96 - 883.96] instead Ashley put incredible pressure
[881.72 - 885.96] on me knowing that I didn't have
[883.96 - 888.68] postpartum support I didn't have anyone
[885.96 - 890.52] there helping me supporting me Ashley
[888.68 - 892.84] and Gretchen were both marketing and
[890.52 - 895.68] running Retreats during the time of
[892.84 - 897.48] Stephan's illness and after she passed
[895.68 - 899.96] the Retreats were out of state and they
[897.48 - 902.84] had to travel to get to them somehow
[899.96 - 904.76] Ashley could travel for the Retreats but
[902.84 - 908.40] she never made it to see
[904.76 - 911.44] Stephanie yeah so while Ashley was busy
[908.40 - 912.96] running Retreats with Gretchen in Hawaii
[911.44 - 915.60] and trying to make money off of the
[912.96 - 918.08] medical medium Community she was bossing
[915.60 - 921.12] you around and putting pressure on you
[918.08 - 923.00] to help even more than you already were
[921.12 - 926.12] you and your husband were there with
[923.00 - 929.04] Stephanie and you showed up to help but
[926.12 - 930.72] Ashley on the other hand we now know
[929.04 - 932.96] that Ashley wasn't physically present
[930.72 - 935.24] for any part of Stephanie's breast lump
[932.96 - 937.48] Discovery she wasn't around for any part
[935.24 - 939.60] of Stephanie's back injury she didn't
[937.48 - 942.60] visit Stephanie in the hospital
[939.60 - 945.36] once as we covered earlier on in these
[942.60 - 947.96] podcasts Ashley the daughter of a
[945.36 - 950.28] billionaire family with a private jet
[947.96 - 953.24] was on a private jet headed to
[950.28 - 956.24] Pennsylvania where Stephanie was just a
[953.24 - 959.20] few months before Stephanie died and
[956.24 - 961.56] Ashley still didn't visit her
[959.20 - 964.36] yeah I know that Stephanie's family
[961.56 - 967.24] didn't even like Ashley or any of the
[964.36 - 968.64] plotters at the time they didn't like
[967.24 - 971.48] the way that she lived they didn't like
[968.64 - 974.80] the way that Steph ate which by the way
[971.48 - 976.12] wasn't exactly medical median she did so
[974.80 - 980.16] many
[976.12 - 984.12] things so the family didn't like Ashley
[980.16 - 986.60] Ashley wasn't around at all and somehow
[984.12 - 990.04] for some reason Ashley has tried to
[986.60 - 992.60] position herself as an authority on
[990.04 - 994.52] Stephanie I want to bring us back to
[992.60 - 996.48] when Ashley posted her original false
[994.52 - 999.72] story online in
[996.48 - 1003.12] 2020 Ashley made more than 15 false
[999.72 - 1006.04] claims in one version and more than 20
[1003.12 - 1008.12] false claims in another version your
[1006.04 - 1010.44] husband however having firsthand
[1008.12 - 1012.48] knowledge of what had occurred corrected
[1010.44 - 1015.56] Ashley in the comments of one of her
[1012.48 - 1017.80] posts he said but you're missing the
[1015.56 - 1020.12] critical part when Anthony at Medical
[1017.80 - 1023.16] medium told told her she needed to see a
[1020.12 - 1025.64] doctor and have the lump dealt with oh I
[1023.16 - 1028.88] forgot that doesn't fit your
[1025.64 - 1031.64] agenda Ashley replied to this by
[1028.88 - 1034.08] saying Anthony didn't tell her to see a
[1031.64 - 1036.52] doctor until she was bleeding from her
[1034.08 - 1038.92] nipples the same point at which he
[1036.52 - 1042.36] stopped communicating with
[1038.92 - 1044.80] her at this point in the plotter podcast
[1042.36 - 1048.52] series we all know that this is far from
[1044.80 - 1051.28] the truth to this your husband responded
[1048.52 - 1053.44] by saying I don't know the whole story
[1051.28 - 1056.44] nor claim to but if you are going to
[1053.44 - 1058.64] claim the truth needs to be out there at
[1056.44 - 1061.04] least do such a thing in its entirety
[1058.64 - 1063.00] the above is one case in point which you
[1061.04 - 1065.24] just acknowledge you skipped over and
[1063.00 - 1066.92] I'm sure there are others kind of
[1065.24 - 1069.76] calling the kettle black when you want
[1066.92 - 1072.24] to make allegations of people being
[1069.76 - 1074.48] Liars your husband called Ashley out for
[1072.24 - 1077.32] being inaccurate and falsely narrating
[1074.48 - 1079.40] the story the way that it served her
[1077.32 - 1081.20] agenda even people people who didn't
[1079.40 - 1083.08] know what happened with Stephanie found
[1081.20 - 1085.04] Ashley's story to be alarmingly
[1083.08 - 1087.92] inconsistent with what they know of
[1085.04 - 1090.84] Anthony and medical medium information
[1087.92 - 1092.76] one person commented and said doesn't he
[1090.84 - 1095.48] always say to see a doctor and see what
[1092.76 - 1098.84] the diagnosis is and go from
[1095.48 - 1101.96] there another person added I listen to
[1098.84 - 1104.04] Anthony's podcasts and have never heard
[1101.96 - 1107.00] him suggest not to see a doctor
[1104.04 - 1108.88] conventional or otherwise I find it hard
[1107.00 - 1111.84] to believe your claim that Anthony
[1108.88 - 1114.80] explicitly told her not to see a
[1111.84 - 1117.28] doctor after all of the push back and
[1114.80 - 1120.44] being corrected by your husband Ashley
[1117.28 - 1123.60] commented this I tried to add it to my
[1120.44 - 1127.12] post but Instagram won't let me but if
[1123.60 - 1130.88] IG will allow me later I will add
[1127.12 - 1133.88] it initially Ashley left out any mention
[1130.88 - 1135.64] of any doctors being involved then here
[1133.88 - 1137.52] because of your husband's correction and
[1135.64 - 1140.40] the push back she was getting she
[1137.52 - 1142.88] changed her story and went on from there
[1140.40 - 1145.80] to say Anthony told Stephanie to see a
[1142.88 - 1148.60] doctor but not until it was too late
[1145.80 - 1151.24] which is still very far from the truth
[1148.60 - 1154.32] and with all of her blatant false claims
[1151.24 - 1157.28] Ashley caused a lot of damage one
[1154.32 - 1159.20] comment on this post read he should have
[1157.28 - 1162.04] told her to see a doctor the moment she
[1159.20 - 1165.24] found the lump and told him it should be
[1162.04 - 1167.48] a lesson for him and any healer I've
[1165.24 - 1170.28] heard similar stories many times with
[1167.48 - 1173.48] other healers I'm just so so sorry again
[1170.28 - 1175.60] to hear this we hope that this person
[1173.48 - 1177.88] has now listened to our podcasts to
[1175.60 - 1180.36] learn the truth even though they
[1177.88 - 1182.64] probably didn't because they're probably
[1180.36 - 1185.68] long gone since being scared by Ashley's
[1182.64 - 1187.56] false claims if they have been listening
[1185.68 - 1191.72] they would have learned that this is
[1187.56 - 1193.84] exactly in fact what Anthony did exactly
[1191.72 - 1196.24] one day after Stephanie reached out
[1193.84 - 1198.20] about her breast lump Discovery Anthony
[1196.24 - 1199.84] and his wife texted that you should
[1198.20 - 1202.24] always c a
[1199.84 - 1204.72] physician even after being corrected by
[1202.24 - 1208.56] your husband Ashley continued on with
[1204.72 - 1211.04] more falsities she commented this he
[1208.56 - 1213.60] told her to see a doctor when it was too
[1211.04 - 1216.40] late for them to do anything and when he
[1213.60 - 1218.84] clearly realized he had screwed up it
[1216.40 - 1221.56] was at this point that he also cut off
[1218.84 - 1224.20] communication with her it doesn't feel
[1221.56 - 1226.80] very relevant to me that after years of
[1224.20 - 1229.72] telling her not to see a doctor and that
[1226.80 - 1233.48] she would be fine he changed his tune
[1229.72 - 1236.12] when she was incredibly ill there are so
[1233.48 - 1239.56] many false things in here it's
[1236.12 - 1242.40] disturbing not a single sentence is
[1239.56 - 1244.80] accurate as we've covered Anthony told
[1242.40 - 1248.12] Stephanie to see a doctor from the very
[1244.80 - 1250.96] beginning he didn't screw up Anthony was
[1248.12 - 1252.88] consistent in his messaging to Stephanie
[1250.96 - 1256.00] all throughout the time of her illness
[1252.88 - 1259.00] that doctors should be involved he never
[1256.00 - 1261.36] changed his tune and Anthony was not the
[1259.00 - 1263.32] one who cut off communication with
[1261.36 - 1267.40] Stephanie we'll get to that more in a
[1263.32 - 1270.08] bit but my gosh Kim no wonder you had to
[1267.40 - 1272.00] make a statement I mean can you just
[1270.08 - 1275.00] describe for us what was going on in the
[1272.00 - 1276.52] community at the time after she did this
[1275.00 - 1278.32] I know that many people had reached out
[1276.52 - 1280.32] to me and I know that many people were
[1278.32 - 1281.68] reaching out to you too what was the
[1280.32 - 1285.00] impression that they had gotten from
[1281.68 - 1287.40] Ashley's post Ashley compared Stephanie
[1285.00 - 1289.40] to her own father who she said did
[1287.40 - 1292.04] everything his fancy doctors told him to
[1289.40 - 1293.52] do but summarized that none of them
[1292.04 - 1296.36] actually had any idea what they were
[1293.52 - 1298.64] doing she said her dad did everything
[1296.36 - 1301.92] the conventional doctors told him to do
[1298.64 - 1304.24] and he died Stephanie also followed
[1301.92 - 1306.32] conventional treatment yet Ashley
[1304.24 - 1309.08] insinuated that Stephanie followed a
[1306.32 - 1311.40] protocol designed by Anthony and died
[1309.08 - 1313.32] this isn't true Stephanie received
[1311.40 - 1316.28] conventional
[1313.32 - 1319.88] treatment as for the community it was a
[1316.28 - 1322.56] mess it became so divided the fear was
[1319.88 - 1325.80] unbelievable what Ashley did was instill
[1322.56 - 1327.72] fear in so many people it was like they
[1325.80 - 1330.32] started thinking their spinach salad or
[1327.72 - 1331.96] their spinach soup was harming them and
[1330.32 - 1334.12] they went back to a standard American
[1331.96 - 1337.96] diet or went back to eating
[1334.12 - 1340.68] McDonald's it's horrifying and it's all
[1337.96 - 1344.20] so far from the truth all based on
[1340.68 - 1346.12] complete completely false claims I've
[1344.20 - 1347.68] seen from the data that Stephanie
[1346.12 - 1350.76] received conventional cancer treatment
[1347.68 - 1353.92] for almost a year here and because you
[1350.76 - 1355.48] unlike Ashley were directly involved
[1353.92 - 1358.12] with Stephanie's situation you were
[1355.48 - 1360.56] there in person you had the ability to
[1358.12 - 1363.16] set the record straight so you and
[1360.56 - 1365.40] another practitioner who was also
[1363.16 - 1367.28] directly involved sent letters out to
[1365.40 - 1369.64] each of your private communities I
[1367.28 - 1371.60] remember those letters I remember the
[1369.64 - 1373.40] volatile situation that Ashley had
[1371.60 - 1375.20] created with her
[1373.40 - 1377.12] disinformation you and the other
[1375.20 - 1380.16] practitioner handled this with a
[1377.12 - 1382.64] tremendous amount of care care Grace and
[1380.16 - 1384.64] a lot of respect while protecting
[1382.64 - 1387.68] Stephanie and her private information
[1384.64 - 1388.80] after Ashley had exploited her to serve
[1387.68 - 1392.24] her own
[1388.80 - 1394.08] agenda I have your letter in front of me
[1392.24 - 1396.20] and here are some of the critical
[1394.08 - 1398.92] clarifications that you
[1396.20 - 1400.48] made Stephanie was not under Anthony's
[1398.92 - 1402.80] care for
[1400.48 - 1405.60] cancer Anthony did not provide
[1402.80 - 1408.80] supplementation or food protocols for
[1405.60 - 1411.12] her Cancer all cancer related medical
[1408.80 - 1413.12] decisions were being made by Stephanie's
[1411.12 - 1416.24] family and a few close
[1413.12 - 1419.56] friends Stephanie received chemotherapy
[1416.24 - 1423.00] and many other conventional Medical
[1419.56 - 1425.44] Treatments you also shared in here about
[1423.00 - 1428.44] how devastating it was for you to have
[1425.44 - 1430.32] lost a friend and about how unhappy you
[1428.44 - 1432.52] knew it would make Stephanie that
[1430.32 - 1434.56] Anthony was being inaccurately blamed
[1432.52 - 1438.24] for such a terrible
[1434.56 - 1440.48] tragedy you had every right to send this
[1438.24 - 1441.76] letter letter you had every right to
[1440.48 - 1443.84] make those
[1441.76 - 1447.68] clarifications and we now know those
[1443.84 - 1449.52] clarifications to be true as proven by
[1447.68 - 1451.12] the evidence that has been presented in
[1449.52 - 1453.76] these podcast
[1451.12 - 1456.44] episodes but Ashley obviously didn't
[1453.76 - 1458.64] like that so can you explain what
[1456.44 - 1461.80] happened after these letters were sent
[1458.64 - 1464.04] out yeah Ashley started attacking me on
[1461.80 - 1465.88] texts on audio messages while I was
[1464.04 - 1468.44] driving in the pouring rain and then she
[1465.88 - 1469.52] took the letters we sent to a very small
[1468.44 - 1471.40] private
[1469.52 - 1473.60] Community these were not public
[1471.40 - 1476.76] communities and she made a retaliation
[1473.60 - 1478.20] post posting these letters publicly and
[1476.76 - 1479.96] then calling me and the other
[1478.20 - 1483.60] practitioner
[1479.96 - 1487.00] Liars okay so let's unpack that in the
[1483.60 - 1490.00] retaliation post Ashley made she said
[1487.00 - 1493.64] this some women I know were really upset
[1490.00 - 1495.24] by my post they knew Stu personally
[1493.64 - 1496.56] though I wouldn't call them good friends
[1495.24 - 1499.00] of
[1496.56 - 1502.68] hers though we've got a false claim
[1499.00 - 1504.48] right at the beginning now I think that
[1502.68 - 1507.56] Ashley tried to Discount your friendship
[1504.48 - 1510.44] with Stephanie to make you appear less
[1507.56 - 1513.36] credible Ashley also did an Instagram
[1510.44 - 1515.08] live on April 1st of 2020 in which she
[1513.36 - 1516.92] took it even
[1515.08 - 1519.92] further
[1516.92 - 1521.84] um what about the response of other
[1519.92 - 1523.16] practitioners defending him and putting
[1521.84 - 1530.32] others
[1523.16 - 1530.32] down man that's so hard to talk about um
[1530.60 - 1533.60] I mean first of all they called
[1531.80 - 1536.00] themselves Steph's friends which was
[1533.60 - 1538.96] really hard because they were not her
[1536.00 - 1540.28] friends like they knew her they weren't
[1538.96 - 1542.36] friends with
[1540.28 - 1546.04] her
[1542.36 - 1548.12] um it's it was amazing to me frankly if
[1546.04 - 1551.96] I'm being totally honest it was like it
[1548.12 - 1555.16] was kind of just shocking and for them
[1551.96 - 1557.80] to see and walk through that experience
[1555.16 - 1560.56] um the only thing I keep coming back to
[1557.80 - 1564.64] is they didn't know stuff that
[1560.56 - 1566.60] well so here she went as far as to say
[1564.64 - 1568.44] publicly that you and the other
[1566.60 - 1570.16] practitioner weren't friends with
[1568.44 - 1572.80] Stephanie at
[1570.16 - 1576.20] all I know that this is false first of
[1572.80 - 1579.32] all because Ashley told me the exact
[1576.20 - 1581.32] opposite on the phone several months ago
[1579.32 - 1584.44] as a reminder to everyone I recorded
[1581.32 - 1586.76] that call and it appeared in our podcast
[1584.44 - 1588.32] episodes in previous episodes and just
[1586.76 - 1590.72] so everyone also knows and understand
[1588.32 - 1593.36] stands that recording was completely
[1590.72 - 1596.40] legal Ashley has made false claims about
[1593.36 - 1600.08] that as well but here is what Ashley
[1596.40 - 1603.40] told me in that call and I said this to
[1600.08 - 1605.24] Kimberly then and I Kimberly is the only
[1603.40 - 1606.84] person I really lost my temper with
[1605.24 - 1608.96] because I felt like she was Steph's
[1606.84 - 1613.52] friend and she saw what
[1608.96 - 1615.96] happened Ashley said to me privately on
[1613.52 - 1619.48] the phone that you were Stephanie's
[1615.96 - 1621.84] friend and that you saw what happened
[1619.48 - 1624.72] why is this the opposite of what Ashley
[1621.84 - 1626.64] shared in her 2020 blog post because it
[1624.72 - 1630.24] sounds to me like she was trying to
[1626.64 - 1632.16] deceive the public in Ashley's live she
[1630.24 - 1634.24] also told this
[1632.16 - 1636.64] falsity they weren't there at the
[1634.24 - 1641.64] beginning of her journey they kind of
[1636.64 - 1644.56] came in at the very end when Anthony
[1641.64 - 1646.96] ghosted this one is even more ridiculous
[1644.56 - 1648.48] I've seen from all the text records that
[1646.96 - 1650.60] the other practitioner ashle is
[1648.48 - 1652.40] referring to became friends with and
[1650.60 - 1656.00] started texting with Stephanie in June
[1652.40 - 1658.52] of 2016 a year before Stephanie's health
[1656.00 - 1661.08] really took a turn and you met Stephanie
[1658.52 - 1663.60] at the live event in 2016 and became
[1661.08 - 1666.04] friends with her at that point as well
[1663.60 - 1668.20] I've seen so much evidence of both of
[1666.04 - 1670.60] you having been there for her and
[1668.20 - 1673.28] offering your support to Stephanie early
[1670.60 - 1675.04] on in her illness Journey as we've
[1673.28 - 1677.00] talked about before Ashley loves to say
[1675.04 - 1679.68] that Anthony ghosted Stephanie to get
[1677.00 - 1682.20] people riled up it's a tactic but it's
[1679.68 - 1684.60] completely false Stephanie's family cut
[1682.20 - 1687.92] off communication between them and told
[1684.60 - 1690.76] Anthony in a very aggressive way to stay
[1687.92 - 1694.24] away so Ashley made plenty of false
[1690.76 - 1696.04] claims here yeah so Stephanie sent me
[1694.24 - 1698.96] hundreds of voice notes many of them
[1696.04 - 1701.92] were a long voice notes that's the kind
[1698.96 - 1704.12] of relationship I had with Steph I got
[1701.92 - 1705.60] many times the daily update from her I
[1704.12 - 1707.56] knew what she did from the moment she
[1705.60 - 1709.20] woke up she would take me through her
[1707.56 - 1712.08] morning morning morning routine and how
[1709.20 - 1715.56] she spent many of her days her messages
[1712.08 - 1717.60] were personal like really really
[1715.56 - 1719.76] personal they were family they were
[1717.60 - 1721.72] about friendships she asked for help
[1719.76 - 1724.96] supporting the ones that she loved she
[1721.72 - 1727.60] always asked for advice I know the very
[1724.96 - 1732.08] intimate details of some of the closest
[1727.60 - 1733.80] family members to her she shared it all
[1732.08 - 1736.36] she offered to stay in my home when I
[1733.80 - 1738.44] was postpartum to care for my son and to
[1736.36 - 1741.52] care for me the way that she did for her
[1738.44 - 1744.20] own nephew I don't think you share that
[1741.52 - 1746.48] much and offer so much with someone who
[1744.20 - 1749.24] is not your
[1746.48 - 1753.60] friend yeah it sounds like the two of
[1749.24 - 1755.52] you were close friends to me we also
[1753.60 - 1757.64] know that Ashley's claims are false
[1755.52 - 1760.24] because we have audios that Stephanie
[1757.64 - 1763.88] had sent to a friend talking about how
[1760.24 - 1767.00] close she was with you Gretchen and Kim
[1763.88 - 1770.04] just become good friends really sweet
[1767.00 - 1770.04] women and really
[1770.32 - 1775.88] people and about trips she had taken
[1773.32 - 1779.12] with you tomorrow I'm actually going
[1775.88 - 1782.12] away with um Kim you know Kim really
[1779.12 - 1783.56] spare Anda SEC cor because she's in
[1782.12 - 1784.80] Pennsylvania right now remember I told
[1783.56 - 1786.40] you about that we're just going to go
[1784.80 - 1788.64] for like a couple days and spend some
[1786.40 - 1791.12] time with her and then again in a couple
[1788.64 - 1794.60] weeks I'm going to go up again for a few
[1791.12 - 1797.04] days we also have a text that Stephanie
[1794.60 - 1799.48] had sent to a friend about you that
[1797.04 - 1801.64] reads she lives by my brother which is
[1799.48 - 1804.28] convenient I introduced her to my
[1801.64 - 1807.04] sis-in-law and fam and they have become
[1804.28 - 1809.96] friends as well so that's been
[1807.04 - 1812.20] nice and we have a long audio from
[1809.96 - 1814.44] Stephanie talking about how you were
[1812.20 - 1816.76] there for part of her back injury which
[1814.44 - 1820.44] was months and months before Anthony was
[1816.76 - 1823.76] told by Stephanie's family to stay
[1820.44 - 1825.08] away hi well I hurt my back in the
[1823.76 - 1827.64] beginning of
[1825.08 - 1830.20] June I you know I hadn't been doing yoga
[1827.64 - 1833.80] for a while or Pilates and I ended up
[1830.20 - 1836.24] just by fluke coincidence I ended up
[1833.80 - 1838.36] doing them both in the same week and by
[1836.24 - 1839.28] the end of that week my lower back felt
[1838.36 - 1840.80] kind of
[1839.28 - 1843.48] weird
[1840.80 - 1845.24] um weird enough where I literally it was
[1843.48 - 1848.84] hurting to go on the rebounder so I kind
[1845.24 - 1850.24] of had to stop that uh and then I went
[1848.84 - 1853.04] to the caropractor and everything was
[1850.24 - 1854.72] better like a day later but I only
[1853.04 - 1857.40] waited like a few days to start
[1854.72 - 1859.16] exercising again you know I started like
[1857.40 - 1862.44] light I just went on the rebounder for
[1859.16 - 1865.04] the first couple days and walked and did
[1862.44 - 1866.96] pocket gym but then after a few days I
[1865.04 - 1869.60] was back into yoga fully and I was like
[1866.96 - 1872.88] doing yoga every day and pilates every
[1869.60 - 1875.64] day or almost every day
[1872.88 - 1877.08] um and I was just feeling so good and I
[1875.64 - 1879.00] just like wanted to do all these things
[1877.08 - 1880.40] and it was so stupid on hindsight I'm
[1879.00 - 1883.96] like what am I thinking you know we know
[1880.40 - 1885.44] better than to do that um just too much
[1883.96 - 1887.24] at once like that especially since I
[1885.44 - 1889.04] hadn't been doing it I mean I felt fine
[1887.24 - 1890.48] doing it I felt I got right back into it
[1889.04 - 1894.00] I was doing like intense stuff and it
[1890.48 - 1896.72] was like great but clearly my body
[1894.00 - 1898.20] wasn't right ready there and so I went
[1896.72 - 1899.88] to the chiropractor again but then it
[1898.20 - 1901.44] never it got a little bit better but
[1899.88 - 1903.00] then I was carrying all these heavy
[1901.44 - 1904.20] watermelons which were killing me but
[1903.00 - 1905.88] like I was hanging out with scretchen
[1904.20 - 1907.24] and Kim and like when I went up there I
[1905.88 - 1909.04] just brought all these watermelons ex
[1907.24 - 1911.96] seeed huge watermelons
[1909.04 - 1913.76] and it just from there it got worse and
[1911.96 - 1916.12] worse and I was with Gretchen for like
[1913.76 - 1919.20] almost a week when I came home at the
[1916.12 - 1922.16] beginning of I as I came home the Fourth
[1919.20 - 1924.64] of July it got it was like horrendous
[1922.16 - 1927.48] like it got really bad
[1924.64 - 1930.24] excruciating like super super bad like
[1927.48 - 1933.36] crazy spasming and nerves like shooting
[1930.24 - 1936.44] pains like and literally I've been home
[1933.36 - 1940.40] doing nothing for the whole month of
[1936.44 - 1943.08] July all of that goes to show that you
[1940.40 - 1945.24] were around and there to see a lot of
[1943.08 - 1946.92] what happened including that Stephanie
[1945.24 - 1950.24] injured her back by doing all of the
[1946.92 - 1952.64] physical things she just described which
[1950.24 - 1955.60] again proves Ashley's original false
[1952.64 - 1959.16] storyline wrong in which Ashley had said
[1955.60 - 1961.72] this on March 7th of 2020 about
[1959.16 - 1965.24] Stephanie in the spring of
[1961.72 - 1967.80] 2017 her back began to eche we talked a
[1965.24 - 1970.16] little bit during her back injury she
[1967.80 - 1972.96] told me Anthony said it was a yoga
[1970.16 - 1975.72] injury I really don't remember hurting
[1972.96 - 1979.20] it in yoga she
[1975.72 - 1981.20] said Ashley claimed that Stephanie had
[1979.20 - 1983.92] said she didn't remember hurting back in
[1981.20 - 1986.16] yoga but we have several audios from
[1983.92 - 1988.08] Stephanie like the one we just played in
[1986.16 - 1990.40] which Stephanie explains to various
[1988.08 - 1993.28] different people all about how she
[1990.40 - 1995.40] injured her back doing yoga and pilates
[1993.28 - 1997.68] so obviously Stephanie was aware and
[1995.40 - 2000.00] remembered because as we covered
[1997.68 - 2001.48] previously Anthony didn't tell Stephanie
[2000.00 - 2004.36] that her back problems were due to a
[2001.48 - 2006.92] yoga injury Stephanie told people that
[2004.36 - 2008.40] she had injured her back doing yoga and
[2006.92 - 2010.28] pilates
[2008.40 - 2012.24] and then she was doing things like
[2010.28 - 2014.88] carrying heavy watermelons with an
[2012.24 - 2016.08] already injured back that you witnessed
[2014.88 - 2018.68] which made things
[2016.08 - 2022.04] worse so now I just want to bring it
[2018.68 - 2025.76] back to Ashley's retaliation post once
[2022.04 - 2028.92] more again she had said this some women
[2025.76 - 2031.52] I know were really upset by my post they
[2028.92 - 2034.24] knew Stu personally though I wouldn't
[2031.52 - 2038.64] call them good friends of
[2034.24 - 2040.48] hers and Ashley's April 1st 2021 live in
[2038.64 - 2043.44] which she said
[2040.48 - 2045.60] this
[2043.44 - 2047.40] um I mean first of all they called
[2045.60 - 2049.92] themselves Steph's friends which was
[2047.40 - 2052.80] really hard because they were not her
[2049.92 - 2054.60] friends like they knew her they weren't
[2052.80 - 2058.08] friends with
[2054.60 - 2060.48] her we've shown that you Kim were indeed
[2058.08 - 2062.40] a good friend of Stephanie's we also
[2060.48 - 2064.32] have text and audio messages showing
[2062.40 - 2067.84] that the other practitioner Ashley was
[2064.32 - 2068.96] referring to was also in fact that a
[2067.84 - 2072.92] good friend of
[2068.96 - 2074.68] Stephanie's on June 29th of 2016
[2072.92 - 2077.60] Stephanie texted the
[2074.68 - 2078.48] practitioner you're so sweet I love you
[2077.60 - 2082.00] dear
[2078.48 - 2085.96] friend in a text from November 11th of
[2082.00 - 2089.64] 2016 Stephanie says to her I love you
[2085.96 - 2093.12] dearly in a text from December 29th of
[2089.64 - 2097.16] 2016 Stephanie said to her hey sweet
[2093.12 - 2099.44] friend in a text from July 8th of 2016
[2097.16 - 2102.52] Stephanie said to her it's also
[2099.44 - 2105.32] validating when sharing with a trusted
[2102.52 - 2107.28] friend and we have audios from Stephanie
[2105.32 - 2109.56] discussing how much this practitioner
[2107.28 - 2111.96] had helped Stephanie Stephanie's
[2109.56 - 2113.88] sister-in-law and Stephanie's brother
[2111.96 - 2116.28] who is now a plotter trying to take down
[2113.88 - 2119.56] the medical medium Community during an
[2116.28 - 2121.80] extremely troubling time for them Tony
[2119.56 - 2123.24] and Megan my brother's Tony his wife
[2121.80 - 2125.56] Megan they wanted me to be there for the
[2123.24 - 2128.60] birth I'm here supporting them you know
[2125.56 - 2129.92] they're um it's just been kind of
[2128.60 - 2132.36] intense there's a lot of stuff that was
[2129.92 - 2135.48] going on to the hospital thank God man
[2132.36 - 2137.48] was with us the entire time like you
[2135.48 - 2139.52] know over the phone and any she was
[2137.48 - 2141.28] always so supportive and there for me
[2139.52 - 2143.76] the whole time and anything we needed
[2141.28 - 2147.68] and supporting tun and
[2143.76 - 2150.12] Megan there are hundreds and hundreds of
[2147.68 - 2152.12] text messages that I've read going back
[2150.12 - 2154.56] and forth between Stephanie and this
[2152.12 - 2156.92] practitioner mostly of Stephanie asking
[2154.56 - 2158.88] the practitioner for advice the
[2156.92 - 2161.12] practitioner also helped Stephanie's
[2158.88 - 2164.00] family in a very significant way during
[2161.12 - 2166.52] a very dark time for them Stephanie
[2164.00 - 2168.12] regularly expressed tremendous gratitude
[2166.52 - 2170.64] for the positive impact this
[2168.12 - 2172.16] practitioner had in her life and in
[2170.64 - 2174.64] her's
[2172.16 - 2176.12] lives we've got all of this evidence of
[2174.64 - 2178.52] Stephanie calling this practitioner a
[2176.12 - 2180.40] dear friend referring to you Kim
[2178.52 - 2181.84] specifically as a good friend and
[2180.40 - 2184.16] talking about all the time that you had
[2181.84 - 2187.16] spent together including during the time
[2184.16 - 2189.24] of Stephanie's back injury clearly this
[2187.16 - 2191.68] practition and you were both very
[2189.24 - 2195.40] important people in Stephanie's life and
[2191.68 - 2198.20] Ashley told another big falsity to the
[2195.40 - 2200.40] public I was even invited to Stephanie's
[2198.20 - 2202.56] celebration of life I was around when
[2200.40 - 2205.36] Stephanie injured her back I remember
[2202.56 - 2208.32] her jumping on that trampoline with her
[2205.36 - 2210.16] injury I supported Stephanie and met up
[2208.32 - 2213.16] with her at the hospital the night that
[2210.16 - 2215.88] her niece was born it's a strange thing
[2213.16 - 2218.44] strange thing to have to qualify a
[2215.88 - 2221.04] friendship but what Ashley said was so
[2218.44 - 2222.76] hurtful because Stephanie was someone
[2221.04 - 2226.28] that I really cared
[2222.76 - 2229.80] about yeah I'm sure it was really
[2226.28 - 2232.52] hurtful and it's a very it's a very um
[2229.80 - 2236.52] it's a low blow it was very low for her
[2232.52 - 2239.04] to go there and so following the false
[2236.52 - 2241.92] friendship claims Ashley's retaliation
[2239.04 - 2244.12] post continued on to say this these two
[2241.92 - 2246.80] women sent out letters about my post to
[2244.12 - 2249.32] their entire communities they
[2246.80 - 2252.16] essentially made it seem like I was
[2249.32 - 2254.80] lying this was a really impactful
[2252.16 - 2257.88] experience for me because something I've
[2254.80 - 2260.64] never realized before is just how much
[2257.88 - 2263.92] you can use facts and distort them to
[2260.64 - 2267.68] create what's actually a lie and there's
[2263.92 - 2271.08] nothing I hate more than
[2267.68 - 2272.72] lying so Ashley is saying that what you
[2271.08 - 2274.92] shared was
[2272.72 - 2278.04] factual but she's still calling you a
[2274.92 - 2279.88] liar and the irony of all
[2278.04 - 2283.52] is that she's calling you a liar in a
[2279.88 - 2287.04] post that she Ashley herself told more
[2283.52 - 2290.64] than 15 false claims in one version of
[2287.04 - 2293.76] and more than 20 in another version of
[2290.64 - 2296.32] Kim how frustrating was it for you to
[2293.76 - 2299.80] watch Ashley do this
[2296.32 - 2302.56] publicly it has been so heartbreaking
[2299.80 - 2305.12] it's been extremely traumatizing for me
[2302.56 - 2306.80] for my family the amount of stress that
[2305.12 - 2309.16] Ashley has created with their false
[2306.80 - 2310.76] stories is just
[2309.16 - 2315.32] unbelievable
[2310.76 - 2316.80] yeah and sadly she didn't stop there
[2315.32 - 2319.20] Ashley tried calling you while you were
[2316.80 - 2321.20] driving in the pouring rain and because
[2319.20 - 2324.00] you didn't answer Ashley sent you a
[2321.20 - 2325.36] barrage of text messages and I want to
[2324.00 - 2327.92] walk us through that
[2325.36 - 2329.92] conversation in the very first text
[2327.92 - 2332.04] Ashley tries to rewrite history by
[2329.92 - 2334.28] retelling her false version of what had
[2332.04 - 2336.52] happened with Stephanie she tried to
[2334.28 - 2338.48] sell this narrative to you Kim when you
[2336.52 - 2341.00] were actually there there for Stephanie
[2338.48 - 2344.76] and witnessing things that had happened
[2341.00 - 2349.76] firsthand in person and Ashley was
[2344.76 - 2353.64] not the text says this hey girl I just
[2349.76 - 2356.72] can't not say something to you Steph was
[2353.64 - 2359.08] personally Guided by Anthony for years
[2356.72 - 2361.88] she did every single thing he ever told
[2359.08 - 2364.32] her to do she laid on her back for
[2361.88 - 2366.80] months while her spine literally
[2364.32 - 2369.12] crumbled because he told her she had a
[2366.80 - 2372.24] yoga in iny that later he ended up
[2369.12 - 2374.36] staying with shingles and then when she
[2372.24 - 2377.92] started bleeding from her nipples after
[2374.36 - 2381.76] telling her she would never have cancer
[2377.92 - 2384.64] his response to cut her off completely
[2381.76 - 2387.16] and never speak to her again up to days
[2384.64 - 2390.64] before Steph died she was texting
[2387.16 - 2392.72] Anthony begging him just to talk to her
[2390.64 - 2395.36] for you to write that letter and
[2392.72 - 2398.36] knowingly mislead people about their
[2395.36 - 2402.32] relationship is so Absol disgusting to
[2398.36 - 2406.08] me and just frankly
[2402.32 - 2409.92] unimaginable this text has six false
[2406.08 - 2413.16] things in it six critical things that
[2409.92 - 2415.36] are completely wrong and it seems as
[2413.16 - 2416.72] though Ashley thinks if she just repeats
[2415.36 - 2419.32] them enough she'll be able to get
[2416.72 - 2421.72] everyone to just go along with it I'm
[2419.32 - 2424.48] going to walk us through the false
[2421.72 - 2426.88] Claims One Stephanie did not do
[2424.48 - 2428.88] everything Anthony ever told her to do
[2426.88 - 2430.48] Anthony consistent message from the
[2428.88 - 2432.72] beginning was that Stephanie should see
[2430.48 - 2434.48] a doctor for her breast lump and
[2432.72 - 2436.36] Stephanie made the decision to wait too
[2434.48 - 2439.24] long to follow that
[2436.36 - 2441.36] advice two Stephanie did not lay on her
[2439.24 - 2442.48] back for months because Anthony told her
[2441.36 - 2445.40] she had an
[2442.48 - 2447.44] injury three Stephanie got stuck laying
[2445.40 - 2449.72] on her back because Stephanie said
[2447.44 - 2453.52] herself she had injured her back doing
[2449.72 - 2456.08] yoga and lates and it was made worse by
[2453.52 - 2458.04] Stephanie carrying heavy watermelons and
[2456.08 - 2460.60] jumping on the trampoline
[2458.04 - 2462.44] which you were actually around to see
[2460.60 - 2464.92] Stephanie got stuck laying on her back
[2462.44 - 2467.24] because her doctor diagnosed her with a
[2464.92 - 2469.40] dis injury and because she was on a
[2467.24 - 2471.68] small old childhood mattress on the
[2469.40 - 2474.40] floor that was terrible for her back and
[2471.68 - 2477.08] made it too difficult for her to get up
[2474.40 - 2480.76] four Stephanie did not bleed from both
[2477.08 - 2484.04] nipples she only bled from one and five
[2480.76 - 2485.56] Anthony never ever told Stephanie that
[2484.04 - 2488.28] she would never have
[2485.56 - 2490.88] cancer and sck
[2488.28 - 2493.96] Anthony did not cut Stephanie off
[2490.88 - 2497.12] Stephanie's family told Anthony to stay
[2493.96 - 2498.80] away Stephanie did not text Anthony
[2497.12 - 2502.20] begging him to talk to
[2498.80 - 2504.56] her Ashley was so wrong about all of it
[2502.20 - 2507.32] from the beginning and yet she continued
[2504.56 - 2509.68] to berate you Kim for the factual letter
[2507.32 - 2512.28] you had sent out to your small private
[2509.68 - 2515.48] Community further text messages in this
[2512.28 - 2518.64] thread from Ashley to you said this she
[2515.48 - 2521.80] found a lump in her breast 3 years
[2518.64 - 2524.80] before she died and he told her it would
[2521.80 - 2528.60] never be cancerous does that bother you
[2524.80 - 2531.24] at all does it like hello is this hiding
[2528.60 - 2535.68] home I get that you weren't there when
[2531.24 - 2536.48] that happened but I was does that I mean
[2535.68 - 2540.60] come
[2536.48 - 2543.28] on that series of texts from Ashley is
[2540.60 - 2546.96] not only incredibly condescending but
[2543.28 - 2549.88] also has three more false things in it
[2546.96 - 2551.40] the the first one Stephanie did not
[2549.88 - 2553.24] discover her breast lump when she was
[2551.40 - 2556.04] living with Ashley in
[2553.24 - 2559.00] 2016 Stephanie in fact discovered the
[2556.04 - 2562.00] lump a year later when Ashley was not
[2559.00 - 2564.20] around the second false thing Anthony
[2562.00 - 2566.84] never told Stephanie that the lump would
[2564.20 - 2569.48] never become cancerous he repeatedly
[2566.84 - 2572.16] encouraged her to get it looked at by a
[2569.48 - 2574.72] physician and here Ashley's putting you
[2572.16 - 2577.60] down by claiming that she was around
[2574.72 - 2580.52] when you were not which is the ex exact
[2577.60 - 2583.60] opposite of the truth that's the third
[2580.52 - 2586.16] falsehood our data shows that Ashley
[2583.60 - 2587.84] wasn't around for any single part of
[2586.16 - 2592.08] Stephanie's experience with her breast
[2587.84 - 2595.68] lump her back injury her cancer or her
[2592.08 - 2597.76] passing and yet you were physically
[2595.68 - 2599.76] there helping Stephanie as much as you
[2597.76 - 2600.84] could after just having a baby during
[2599.76 - 2603.80] Stephanie's
[2600.84 - 2606.68] illness you responded to Ashley by
[2603.80 - 2608.16] saying in all caps I'm driving in the
[2606.68 - 2610.40] pouring
[2608.16 - 2612.84] rain which sounds to me like you were
[2610.40 - 2615.00] begging her to stop attacking you and
[2612.84 - 2617.64] then Ashley replied to you by saying
[2615.00 - 2619.96] this I'm not there to see it so maybe
[2617.64 - 2623.52] it's not actually
[2619.96 - 2623.52] happening later
[2624.96 - 2632.24] Kim and then she sends three ey roll
[2629.52 - 2635.00] emojis what Ashley is again
[2632.24 - 2636.88] condescendingly implying to you is that
[2635.00 - 2638.48] you don't believe in Ashley's story
[2636.88 - 2640.68] which we know is
[2638.48 - 2642.40] false she's saying it's because you
[2640.68 - 2644.84] weren't there to see it and that's why
[2642.40 - 2647.96] you don't believe her Ashley is saying
[2644.84 - 2651.56] that Ashley was there to see it and you
[2647.96 - 2654.36] weren't but in reality it's the exact
[2651.56 - 2658.84] opposite the real truth is that you were
[2654.36 - 2659.68] there and Ashley wasn't the truth you
[2658.84 - 2664.04] were
[2659.68 - 2665.72] there Ashley wasn't if Ashley wants to
[2664.04 - 2667.64] play the comparison game and use
[2665.72 - 2669.20] physical proximity as a measure of
[2667.64 - 2672.64] someone's authority to speak on
[2669.20 - 2674.72] Stephanie then in reality based on facts
[2672.64 - 2677.84] Ashley loses at her own
[2674.72 - 2681.00] game however Ashley ends up going on to
[2677.84 - 2683.40] say this to you I know that you can see
[2681.00 - 2686.76] what you did I know
[2683.40 - 2690.32] it I don't know how you can live with it
[2686.76 - 2694.04] but I know you can see it and I hope it
[2690.32 - 2694.04] haunts you bye
[2694.08 - 2700.16] Kim and then you replied by saying
[2697.08 - 2702.76] saying no Ash we all tried to help with
[2700.16 - 2704.24] all we had when it was going on I know
[2702.76 - 2706.76] you don't realize that but it's the
[2704.24 - 2708.48] truth I was barely paying my own bills
[2706.76 - 2710.16] and was buying her supplements at one
[2708.48 - 2713.12] point and doing everything I could with
[2710.16 - 2714.92] a brand new baby nobody saw that make me
[2713.12 - 2717.52] a monster
[2714.92 - 2719.80] though and then Ashley sent you some
[2717.52 - 2723.04] voice messages that we're going to play
[2719.80 - 2725.00] now Kim I don't think that you're a
[2723.04 - 2728.48] monster I think that what you did in
[2725.00 - 2732.00] your letter is you isolate facts and you
[2728.48 - 2734.68] painted an untrue picture of what
[2732.00 - 2738.16] happened it's just not
[2734.68 - 2741.04] true for you to use the facts that you
[2738.16 - 2744.52] do have and manipulate them in such a
[2741.04 - 2747.28] way I just I mean come
[2744.52 - 2749.28] on and honestly I don't even care about
[2747.28 - 2751.84] all the people that it impacted because
[2749.28 - 2754.48] they will have their chance to hear the
[2751.84 - 2757.20] truth I can't even call it lying because
[2754.48 - 2760.96] of the way that you used facts but you
[2757.20 - 2764.76] used them so articulately to distort the
[2760.96 - 2768.40] truth that it ended up being a lie and I
[2764.76 - 2768.40] hate that I can't stand
[2769.88 - 2777.40] liars wow wow just unre
[2775.44 - 2780.80] wow first of
[2777.40 - 2783.36] all I want to oh
[2780.80 - 2784.96] sorry it still gives me Goose Goosebumps
[2783.36 - 2787.80] hearing that
[2784.96 - 2791.20] yeah yeah yeah
[2787.80 - 2793.48] yeah I can imagine it's she first of all
[2791.20 - 2796.24] I want to point out that Ashley said
[2793.48 - 2798.92] here that she doesn't care about all the
[2796.24 - 2800.24] people who her post impacted because
[2798.92 - 2803.48] she's saying that they will have their
[2800.24 - 2805.40] chance to hear the truth in fact the
[2803.48 - 2808.08] people Ashley impacted with her false
[2805.40 - 2809.96] 2020 posts didn't get a chance to hear
[2808.08 - 2811.88] the truth before these
[2809.96 - 2815.20] podcasts if they're even still around
[2811.88 - 2818.56] and listening Ashley has impacted many
[2815.20 - 2821.20] people and hurt many people with her
[2818.56 - 2822.60] disinformation secondly Ashley's being
[2821.20 - 2825.40] incredibly manipulative in these
[2822.60 - 2828.00] messages she's twisted everything around
[2825.40 - 2830.08] so much it's actually scary she's
[2828.00 - 2832.40] attacking you relentlessly while you're
[2830.08 - 2834.80] driving in the pouring rain her
[2832.40 - 2837.36] information is all wrong she wasn't
[2834.80 - 2839.92] actually there and you were yet she's
[2837.36 - 2841.88] putting you down demeaning you and
[2839.92 - 2844.08] admitting that you used facts so she can
[2841.88 - 2846.04] actually call it lying but at the same
[2844.08 - 2848.24] time she's calling you a liar with all
[2846.04 - 2852.08] those falsities in her text at the same
[2848.24 - 2855.48] time how did it feel to have a grown
[2852.08 - 2858.88] woman act like this and treat you like
[2855.48 - 2861.48] this honestly Amber I have PTSD from
[2858.88 - 2863.24] what Ashley did to me that night I was
[2861.48 - 2865.88] driving to my sister-in-law's wedding
[2863.24 - 2869.92] festivities I was alone it was dark it
[2865.88 - 2872.56] was pouring down rain Ashley would not
[2869.92 - 2874.80] stop she wouldn't stop I had to call my
[2872.56 - 2877.96] husband on the phone because I was
[2874.80 - 2880.36] shaking at the time I was doing my best
[2877.96 - 2882.80] to protect Stephanie's privacy and to
[2880.36 - 2886.48] not let her be exploited by Ashley it's
[2882.80 - 2889.60] really sad that Ashley has taken it this
[2886.48 - 2891.64] far I've now been attacked personally
[2889.60 - 2894.48] professionally my family has been
[2891.64 - 2897.24] attacked Ashley is actually the most
[2894.48 - 2901.24] intimidating person I've ever
[2897.24 - 2903.64] met yeah I'm so sorry Kim that you've
[2901.24 - 2906.36] had to go through all that and it's
[2903.64 - 2910.04] really not okay that she's that she
[2906.36 - 2912.36] attacked like this and it's really Brave
[2910.04 - 2914.56] of you to come on here and talk about it
[2912.36 - 2916.44] because I'm sure that everything were
[2914.56 - 2920.56] discussing you know brings up a lot of
[2916.44 - 2922.20] emotion and what's even worse is that
[2920.56 - 2924.72] Ashley didn't stop
[2922.20 - 2926.64] there that exchange that we just went
[2924.72 - 2930.48] through was in
[2926.64 - 2933.28] 2020 now 3 years later several months
[2930.48 - 2934.76] ago after I caught Ashley and the other
[2933.28 - 2936.40] plotters for what they were trying to do
[2934.76 - 2937.32] to Anthony and the medical medium
[2936.40 - 2939.24] community
[2937.32 - 2942.44] and we exposed them in our podcast
[2939.24 - 2945.00] episodes Ashley went on a rampage on
[2942.44 - 2946.92] social media rather than addressing any
[2945.00 - 2949.96] of her false claims we had corrected her
[2946.92 - 2953.00] on with evidence she pivoted onto other
[2949.96 - 2955.08] points of focus she began bullying and
[2953.00 - 2956.60] making fun of Anthony she made fun of
[2955.08 - 2959.00] the light blast and the collecting
[2956.60 - 2961.20] Stones meditation she made fun of the
[2959.00 - 2965.12] medical medium Community many of its
[2961.20 - 2968.20] members one of her targets was you and
[2965.12 - 2972.08] shockingly your kids
[2968.20 - 2975.72] on August 17th Ashley posted this this
[2972.08 - 2978.52] is not enough fuel for a child to thrive
[2975.72 - 2981.48] if you watch closely you will see that
[2978.52 - 2984.40] the children of influencers who promote
[2981.48 - 2989.00] extremely restricted diets are often
[2984.40 - 2989.00] incredibly small just like Kim's
[2991.32 - 2998.08] kids in this she tagged you along with a
[2995.56 - 3000.44] screenshot of a pH photo of your three
[2998.08 - 3002.60] kids plates that you had posted that
[3000.44 - 3004.92] you'd captioned Beach
[3002.60 - 3007.72] snacks the plates all have a lot of
[3004.92 - 3009.80] avocado a bunch of cucumber sticks a
[3007.72 - 3012.08] bunch of strawberries and a pile of
[3009.80 - 3014.64] cooked cassava flour tortilla
[3012.08 - 3017.60] chips Ashley continues on in the next
[3014.64 - 3020.24] story post switching back to the priate
[3017.60 - 3022.52] convo for a second many of you are
[3020.24 - 3025.68] sharing more accounts of raw vegan
[3022.52 - 3027.44] children and it's really sad a few of
[3025.68 - 3031.24] you have made the point point that some
[3027.44 - 3034.76] kids are just small and that's true some
[3031.24 - 3036.88] kids are just small but all of RA vegan
[3034.76 - 3040.80] kids are noticeably small in a
[3036.88 - 3043.96] significant way I've never seen a single
[3040.80 - 3046.80] example otherwise Bud would welcome
[3043.96 - 3051.00] being challenged on that
[3046.80 - 3052.56] point and then just a little bit later
[3051.00 - 3055.28] after Ashley must have gotten some
[3052.56 - 3058.36] serious push back on this she deleted
[3055.28 - 3060.72] the first story and then posted this one
[3058.36 - 3063.64] I did remove that repost of the lunch
[3060.72 - 3066.48] trays though because it didn't sit right
[3063.64 - 3070.76] with me I don't want to tear down moms
[3066.48 - 3073.04] on here however I still think it is sad
[3070.76 - 3077.60] and abusive to raise your kids on a
[3073.04 - 3081.08] severely restricted diet how about
[3077.60 - 3084.76] y'all when I first read this I was sick
[3081.08 - 3088.12] to my stomach this is truly despicable
[3084.76 - 3089.72] behavior from Ashley and I would ask any
[3088.12 - 3092.28] mom out there how would you feel if
[3089.72 - 3094.36] somebody did this to you and your kids
[3092.28 - 3096.76] everyone is entitled of course to their
[3094.36 - 3099.28] own dietary belief system but it is
[3096.76 - 3101.52] unacceptable to shame and attack moms
[3099.28 - 3102.84] publicly for how you think they feed
[3101.52 - 3106.40] their kids like
[3102.84 - 3107.68] this next I have to walk us through and
[3106.40 - 3110.04] point out the falsehoods and
[3107.68 - 3112.96] inconsistencies here because it's
[3110.04 - 3115.88] insane Ashley attacked yuk Kim for
[3112.96 - 3117.80] supposedly Mal nourishing your children
[3115.88 - 3120.64] referring to photo of your kids plates
[3117.80 - 3123.44] as lunch trays when in the exact
[3120.64 - 3126.76] screenshot as used from you you
[3123.44 - 3129.16] literally captioned it Beach snacks and
[3126.76 - 3132.96] she has that in the photo that she
[3129.16 - 3134.88] reposted how much sense does it make to
[3132.96 - 3137.88] judge what somebody feeds their kids as
[3134.88 - 3140.64] a snack as if it were a meal first of
[3137.88 - 3142.72] all and then the snack plates in the
[3140.64 - 3145.00] photo have plenty of food on them there
[3142.72 - 3146.64] are piles of cooked cassava flower chips
[3145.00 - 3148.68] with guacamole there are plenty of
[3146.64 - 3152.28] strawberries and cucumber sticks as I
[3148.68 - 3154.88] said they were Beach snacks they weren't
[3152.28 - 3156.48] intended to be a Thanksgiving dinner
[3154.88 - 3160.48] they were
[3156.48 - 3163.48] snacks once again Ashley got it
[3160.48 - 3165.60] wrong all of your posts online show your
[3163.48 - 3167.36] fridge being loaded with huge amounts of
[3165.60 - 3169.60] food and your kids eating plenty of food
[3167.36 - 3171.64] with tons of variety your kids are
[3169.60 - 3173.20] obviously far from restricted and it's
[3171.64 - 3174.84] clear that Ashley was just trying to
[3173.20 - 3177.68] hurt you and I'm
[3174.84 - 3180.00] sorry thank you yeah she definitely got
[3177.68 - 3183.40] me with that one um it first made me
[3180.00 - 3185.92] really mad I cried a lot and then I
[3183.40 - 3189.56] actually started to laugh because it's
[3185.92 - 3191.96] just so insane we were traveling when I
[3189.56 - 3194.96] posted those trays it was my husband's
[3191.96 - 3197.56] 40th birthday those trays don't belong
[3194.96 - 3201.48] to me but I can tell you they were giant
[3197.56 - 3204.36] man-sized trays my baby was one at the
[3201.48 - 3208.08] time my daughter in preschool and my son
[3204.36 - 3210.44] is eight they're little young children
[3208.08 - 3212.12] you are correct Amber these were snacks
[3210.44 - 3215.96] to take to the
[3212.12 - 3218.00] beach as for the insults about my kids I
[3215.96 - 3220.04] was so sick years ago before medical
[3218.00 - 3222.72] medium and these kids were raised with
[3220.04 - 3225.44] the principles that healed my body none
[3222.72 - 3227.88] of them have ever had a cavity they
[3225.44 - 3230.68] rarely catch colds and flu and when they
[3227.88 - 3233.12] get something they bounce right back I
[3230.68 - 3235.40] attribute that to the way that we live
[3233.12 - 3238.64] and I would never call that restrictive
[3235.40 - 3240.32] illness is restrict restrictive Wellness
[3238.64 - 3242.56] is freedom and I know so many of you
[3240.32 - 3247.76] would agree with
[3242.56 - 3250.68] that yes yes really well said and I also
[3247.76 - 3252.80] want to point out how Ashley conflates
[3250.68 - 3255.96] medical medium information with raw
[3252.80 - 3257.92] veganism yet again I know that your kids
[3255.96 - 3260.36] are not raw
[3257.92 - 3262.96] vegan yeah Amber my kids are not raw
[3260.36 - 3264.80] vegan they never have been I have no
[3262.96 - 3267.04] idea why Ashley would put me in that
[3264.80 - 3268.92] category there's nothing
[3267.04 - 3272.56] wrong with raw vegans but my kids are
[3268.92 - 3276.88] not and they never have been my son has
[3272.56 - 3278.84] consumed cooked soup that Ashley herself
[3276.88 - 3281.36] made while I was staying with
[3278.84 - 3283.60] her um that was when we went to visit
[3281.36 - 3285.72] her family's home in PPP Beach my son
[3283.60 - 3288.32] was also one of the first ones to trial
[3285.72 - 3290.72] her cooked bread recipe and some of the
[3288.32 - 3293.88] cooked potato recipe in Ashley's ebooks
[3290.72 - 3295.76] that I always supported one scroll back
[3293.88 - 3298.16] will let all of you see that my kids eat
[3295.76 - 3300.80] loads of produce yes they do and they
[3298.16 - 3303.12] enjoy it but they also consumed cooked
[3300.80 - 3304.56] foods and they eat plenty of Treats
[3303.12 - 3309.20] they're kids you
[3304.56 - 3313.24] guys once again Ashley got it
[3309.20 - 3314.56] wrong yeah once again very wrong it's so
[3313.24 - 3317.60] upsetting
[3314.56 - 3320.72] and I'm sure I'm sure it's so upsetting
[3317.60 - 3326.36] I can't imagine having my kids attacked
[3320.72 - 3329.64] like that um it's so Ashley has actually
[3326.36 - 3330.56] senen your kids eat cooked food that she
[3329.64 - 3333.68] made
[3330.56 - 3336.88] herself and she still called them raw
[3333.68 - 3339.76] vegan it's it's mind-blowing correct and
[3336.88 - 3341.80] correct what's so insane and what also
[3339.76 - 3344.24] speaks to how carelessly Ashley just
[3341.80 - 3347.04] hurdles out attacks with paying such
[3344.24 - 3350.36] little attention to facts and details is
[3347.04 - 3353.40] that in the exact screenshot Ashley took
[3350.36 - 3356.52] from you and displayed in her post it
[3353.40 - 3359.16] clearly shows cooked chips on all of
[3356.52 - 3361.80] your kids plates you even tagged the
[3359.16 - 3364.60] brand of the cooked chips you gave your
[3361.80 - 3366.80] kids as a snack with guacamole anybody
[3364.60 - 3369.44] could figure out that they are cooked
[3366.80 - 3372.36] chips and obviously if you're feeding
[3369.44 - 3374.84] your kids cooked chips they're not raw
[3372.36 - 3376.36] vegan and what Ashley's saying doesn't
[3374.84 - 3379.92] make any
[3376.36 - 3382.08] sense Ashley got all of these things so
[3379.92 - 3383.92] wrong anybody who's viewing these
[3382.08 - 3387.60] stories can catch the inconsistencies
[3383.92 - 3390.24] for themselves but this is how as asy is
[3387.60 - 3393.20] sloppy Ashley never has the details
[3390.24 - 3396.04] right makes mistakes constantly and
[3393.20 - 3399.08] leaves a trail of falsities
[3396.04 - 3401.68] everywhere and then in this series of
[3399.08 - 3404.96] attacks on your kids Ashley had the
[3401.68 - 3409.60] audacity to call your children
[3404.96 - 3411.80] small Kim your kids are objectively some
[3409.60 - 3415.28] of the healthiest and strongest looking
[3411.80 - 3418.24] kids that I've ever seen it's ridiculous
[3415.28 - 3418.24] thank you
[3418.92 - 3423.60] I'm super blessed in that department and
[3421.80 - 3425.16] if you followed along with my journey
[3423.60 - 3427.24] you've likely seen the pictures of my
[3425.16 - 3429.24] son that I've shared over the past year
[3427.24 - 3430.80] I'm pretty proud of him he's ahead
[3429.24 - 3433.80] taller than most of the kids in this
[3430.80 - 3435.80] grade he's 90th percentile for height
[3433.80 - 3437.72] he's a travel and All-Star baseball
[3435.80 - 3440.92] player in fact he was on three baseball
[3437.72 - 3442.80] teams this year he's strong he's fast
[3440.92 - 3445.64] he's unbelievable and I know that sounds
[3442.80 - 3447.60] ridiculous because he's my son but I
[3445.64 - 3448.88] have every right to be proud after I
[3447.60 - 3450.52] went through what I went through with
[3448.88 - 3452.16] his birth and postpartum with him and
[3450.52 - 3455.28] just being so unwell years ago before
[3452.16 - 3458.20] finding Anthony he's not small at all
[3455.28 - 3459.96] it's quite the opposite my middle
[3458.20 - 3461.28] daughter and there's been a lot of
[3459.96 - 3463.48] commenting about her in the community
[3461.28 - 3465.44] because I've shared her too she's a
[3463.48 - 3468.48] gymnast she's an All-Star cheerleader
[3465.44 - 3470.84] who has literally abs of steel um if
[3468.48 - 3472.96] you've seen videos of her you've likely
[3470.84 - 3475.68] seen a lot of you have commented she's
[3472.96 - 3477.52] literally jacked the girl has muscles
[3475.68 - 3479.20] that I didn't have when I was training
[3477.52 - 3482.92] during some of the most intense training
[3479.20 - 3486.28] periods of my life she's muscle and my
[3482.92 - 3489.00] baby who is now to is literally a tub
[3486.28 - 3492.08] she's got a couple chin rolls um so
[3489.00 - 3494.96] while this does make me angry and you
[3492.08 - 3498.24] know she did attack my children I really
[3494.96 - 3499.88] think that one simple photo tells it all
[3498.24 - 3503.20] it's time for me to speak out because
[3499.88 - 3505.80] actually Ashley is a bully she bullied
[3503.20 - 3508.92] my children who does that really who
[3505.80 - 3510.88] does that that these are lies she has no
[3508.92 - 3513.32] business commenting on my children she
[3510.88 - 3515.24] has no idea how big or small they are
[3513.32 - 3517.52] she has no idea what they
[3515.24 - 3519.16] eat I'm still laughing at the
[3517.52 - 3521.40] accusations from the chips and guacamole
[3519.16 - 3524.48] plate that was my husband's
[3521.40 - 3527.60] 40th birthday it was a party at the
[3524.48 - 3531.08] beach this is just one example of how my
[3527.60 - 3533.44] life has been disrupted for years now
[3531.08 - 3536.40] because of Ashley her social media post
[3533.44 - 3539.16] ruined that trip for me and my husband
[3536.40 - 3542.44] 40th birthday because they changed my
[3539.16 - 3544.24] mood completely they were hurtful and
[3542.44 - 3549.60] they brought a tremendous amount of
[3544.24 - 3552.84] stress by publicly attacking me and my
[3549.60 - 3555.44] kids yeah it's terrible and it's
[3552.84 - 3558.04] ridiculous Ashley never should have
[3555.44 - 3561.16] stooped that low she never should have
[3558.04 - 3563.52] done that then after Ashley clearly must
[3561.16 - 3565.08] have gotten called out Ashley said she
[3563.52 - 3567.64] removed that post because she doesn't
[3565.08 - 3569.76] want to tear down mom on here but she
[3567.64 - 3571.96] still left another story post up in
[3569.76 - 3575.28] which she attacked a different mom and
[3571.96 - 3577.36] her kid for their diet it's obvious that
[3575.28 - 3579.64] the whole point of these posts was to
[3577.36 - 3581.12] put down moms for how Ashley thinks they
[3579.64 - 3584.40] feed their kids and the way that their
[3581.12 - 3588.40] kids look and like you said Kim who does
[3584.40 - 3590.76] that Ashley literally used the word
[3588.40 - 3593.36] abuse and applied that you were abusing
[3590.76 - 3595.24] your kids by what you're feeding them
[3593.36 - 3597.52] when she wasn't even accurate with any
[3595.24 - 3600.32] of her claims
[3597.52 - 3602.52] there's nothing more egregious Ashley
[3600.32 - 3604.36] just didn't get away with it and after
[3602.52 - 3607.32] receiving push back that's when she
[3604.36 - 3608.36] deleted some of it your kids are not
[3607.32 - 3610.96] even raw
[3608.36 - 3614.64] vegan some of it yeah she deleted only
[3610.96 - 3617.72] some of it and some left other parts up
[3614.64 - 3619.36] yeah your kids are not even raw vegan
[3617.72 - 3621.84] medical medium information is not the
[3619.36 - 3624.44] same thing as raw veganism her posts
[3621.84 - 3626.64] don't make logical sense Ashley's raw
[3624.44 - 3629.12] vegan attacks are also a especially
[3626.64 - 3631.96] baffling to me considering the fact that
[3629.12 - 3636.36] many of her own best friends and
[3631.96 - 3638.64] co-plot are actually raw vegans yeah I
[3636.36 - 3641.12] wonder how Ashley's raw vegan co-
[3638.64 - 3642.76] plotters and best friends feel now about
[3641.12 - 3644.84] how they have supported Ashley and
[3642.76 - 3647.20] getting to where she is now that she
[3644.84 - 3649.72] uses her platform to viciously criticize
[3647.20 - 3652.88] the diet that they follow and promote in
[3649.72 - 3655.16] their businesses going as far as to call
[3652.88 - 3657.44] moms who feed their kids raw vegan food
[3655.16 - 3660.08] abusive
[3657.44 - 3662.16] plus what Ashley said in this Rampage is
[3660.08 - 3666.32] wildly contradictive to what Ashley has
[3662.16 - 3668.04] said herself in the past in an Instagram
[3666.32 - 3671.12] story post that Ashley made at the end
[3668.04 - 3674.16] of 2019 to sell her own ebook she said
[3671.12 - 3678.12] this you deserve to nourish your body in
[3674.16 - 3680.96] whatever way you choose without fear of
[3678.12 - 3684.20] condemnation you deserve unquestioned
[3680.96 - 3687.92] authority over what your children are
[3684.20 - 3687.92] fed unreal
[3688.00 - 3692.24] wild
[3689.32 - 3696.36] contradiction this is another prime
[3692.24 - 3698.16] example of sloppy Ashley it's a prime
[3696.36 - 3700.60] example of someone who is always
[3698.16 - 3703.08] changing to fit a narrative that suits
[3700.60 - 3706.44] her agenda of the
[3703.08 - 3709.04] moment Kim this was absolutely
[3706.44 - 3711.64] reprehensible of Ashley to do to your to
[3709.04 - 3713.28] you and your family and I'm so sorry
[3711.64 - 3714.84] that you were the target of this attack
[3713.28 - 3717.16] and that your kids were the target of
[3714.84 - 3720.08] this attack
[3717.16 - 3723.12] it's been a lot it's impacted my husband
[3720.08 - 3726.56] in a big way too it's been completely
[3723.12 - 3729.36] unnecessary stress and from mother to
[3726.56 - 3731.76] mother all I think about every time she
[3729.36 - 3734.44] puts these posts out there is that this
[3731.76 - 3737.04] is time and energy away from our kids
[3734.44 - 3738.60] and away from our families we're not
[3737.04 - 3741.96] getting this time
[3738.60 - 3744.04] back like I said so many trips so many
[3741.96 - 3746.76] family events so many holidays so many
[3744.04 - 3750.20] birthdays have been ruined for me
[3746.76 - 3753.68] because of unnecessary abuse from
[3750.20 - 3756.20] Ashley Kim I can't imagine being a mom
[3753.68 - 3758.04] and then being publicly shamed for
[3756.20 - 3760.68] feeding your kids healthy
[3758.04 - 3763.36] snacks and being shamed in a way that
[3760.68 - 3767.08] confuses people into thinking that you
[3763.36 - 3770.36] must be some kind of terrible Mom that's
[3767.08 - 3773.88] abusively starving your kids it's
[3770.36 - 3776.60] uncons sadly Ashley has so many things
[3773.88 - 3779.44] wrong another exhibit on how Ashley
[3776.60 - 3781.48] makes mistakes it makes sense as to how
[3779.44 - 3783.44] Ashley got everything wrong to begin
[3781.48 - 3786.84] with with the Stephanie story when you
[3783.44 - 3789.64] look at how many things how many details
[3786.84 - 3791.80] and how many claims are twisted
[3789.64 - 3794.16] discombobulated and just straight out
[3791.80 - 3794.16] factually
[3796.20 - 3805.04] incorrect exactly exactly and now Kim I
[3802.12 - 3806.28] want to just bring us back to 2020 for a
[3805.04 - 3808.12] moment
[3806.28 - 3810.56] I know that Ashley was attacking you in
[3808.12 - 3813.52] a similar way in the comments of her
[3810.56 - 3814.88] retaliation post back then and implying
[3813.52 - 3816.92] that you hadn't done enough for
[3814.88 - 3819.16] Stephanie when she was sick your husband
[3816.92 - 3822.48] defended you in a comment in which he
[3819.16 - 3824.64] said this to Ashley can't sleep because
[3822.48 - 3826.80] your comment of expecting Kimberly to go
[3824.64 - 3829.88] in a hospital right after having a child
[3826.80 - 3832.12] is ridiculous postpartum mothers are
[3829.88 - 3833.96] supposed to be resting she wasn't
[3832.12 - 3836.36] resting as she was making food and other
[3833.96 - 3838.64] stuff to send to Steph on top of driving
[3836.36 - 3841.16] it to her before she was cleared to
[3838.64 - 3842.88] actually drive all of this led to the
[3841.16 - 3845.24] health issues you mentioned of an
[3842.88 - 3847.76] enlarged uterus from not resting and
[3845.24 - 3850.08] taking care of herself clearly wasn't
[3847.76 - 3852.60] enough for you I guess and for the
[3850.08 - 3854.40] record I was the one that held her back
[3852.60 - 3856.04] and didn't want her to do even more than
[3854.40 - 3858.28] she already did and kept her out of the
[3856.04 - 3861.00] hospital which is no place for a new
[3858.28 - 3862.80] mother if it can be avoided so I guess
[3861.00 - 3864.20] I'm the bad guy here for trying to
[3862.80 - 3866.20] protect
[3864.20 - 3868.52] Kimberly all of this was was playing out
[3866.20 - 3870.80] online at the same time as Ashley was
[3868.52 - 3872.48] attacking you in the written and audio
[3870.80 - 3874.88] texts we went through
[3872.48 - 3876.20] previously and then there was an email
[3874.88 - 3878.92] you'd sent to someone who was your
[3876.20 - 3881.12] friend at the time the next
[3878.92 - 3884.44] morning I have that email in front of me
[3881.12 - 3886.32] and it says thank you for the email last
[3884.44 - 3888.96] night Ashley started sending me terrible
[3886.32 - 3891.88] text messages voice messages and then
[3888.96 - 3894.48] that post I'm not sure what prompted all
[3891.88 - 3896.56] of it honestly I didn't even read it as
[3894.48 - 3899.36] I was at a family event honoring my soon
[3896.56 - 3901.08] to be sister-in-law my poor husband was
[3899.36 - 3902.92] defending our side of the story as she
[3901.08 - 3905.12] put my personal information right in
[3902.92 - 3907.48] that post and failed to mention that I
[3905.12 - 3909.16] had a baby who was just weeks old as we
[3907.48 - 3912.44] were still running around and trying to
[3909.16 - 3914.36] do what we could on No Sleep our lives
[3912.44 - 3916.08] are very different and I don't think Ash
[3914.36 - 3918.24] can understand a family that has to work
[3916.08 - 3920.84] for a living and care for their children
[3918.24 - 3922.80] without help and servants I'm not being
[3920.84 - 3924.48] condescending but realistic the
[3922.80 - 3927.08] statements she made about me were
[3924.48 - 3929.04] appalling I was driving things to Steph
[3927.08 - 3931.72] before I was even cleared to drive a car
[3929.04 - 3934.76] after birth these girls put that
[3931.72 - 3937.04] pressure on me my husband was so upset
[3934.76 - 3939.48] that he took on as much as he could I'm
[3937.04 - 3942.44] really really hurt by the twists and
[3939.48 - 3944.12] lies it's a different lifestyle and she
[3942.44 - 3946.12] can't wrap her head around a mother
[3944.12 - 3948.40] working and caring for two children
[3946.12 - 3951.36] without a nanny or understand that
[3948.40 - 3953.80] husbands leave and go to work all of
[3951.36 - 3956.52] this on no sleep with a newborn and a
[3953.80 - 3959.00] 2-year-old but somehow I didn't do
[3956.52 - 3960.84] enough for her I had Gretchen staying at
[3959.00 - 3963.92] my home during such a sacred time of
[3960.84 - 3966.48] having a newborn not to mention my fear
[3963.92 - 3969.32] of her being in and out of the hospital
[3966.48 - 3970.84] and around my tiny new baby I don't know
[3969.32 - 3973.48] what the answer is here but she is
[3970.84 - 3976.28] pointing a lot of fingers and there is
[3973.48 - 3978.84] no truth to so much of what she's saying
[3976.28 - 3982.12] I feel awful harsh and heavy energy from
[3978.84 - 3984.88] her she has an agenda to spread fear and
[3982.12 - 3987.84] make herself look like a hero I wish she
[3984.88 - 3991.56] would spread life and her love and her
[3987.84 - 3993.36] beautiful spirit this is just upsetting
[3991.56 - 3995.28] anyway I'm pretty exhausted from all of
[3993.36 - 3997.52] this I hope you are resting today as I
[3995.28 - 3998.96] can barely move from all the stress last
[3997.52 - 4001.52] night
[3998.96 - 4005.12] Kimberly can you share more with us Kim
[4001.52 - 4007.32] about why why it was that Ashley and
[4005.12 - 4009.72] Gretchen were putting so much pressure
[4007.32 - 4011.20] on you to help Stephanie more and more
[4009.72 - 4014.36] when you just had a baby there was so
[4011.20 - 4016.08] much going on and it was up to a 4-Hour
[4014.36 - 4018.52] drive one way
[4016.08 - 4020.40] for you why did Stephanie need so much
[4018.52 - 4022.48] help with food poor Stephanie wouldn't
[4020.40 - 4024.56] eat the hospital food she was relying on
[4022.48 - 4026.48] friends to bring her food when she
[4024.56 - 4028.64] couldn't get enough help from friends or
[4026.48 - 4031.04] family she just wouldn't eat looking
[4028.64 - 4035.40] back I asked myself why wouldn't an
[4031.04 - 4039.12] extremely wealthy friend send food a
[4035.40 - 4041.48] chef support something instead I was
[4039.12 - 4043.48] pushed to the max I opened up my home
[4041.48 - 4046.08] postpartum to Gretchen who came to care
[4043.48 - 4047.92] for Steph Gretchen was also met at the
[4046.08 - 4049.68] airport with a hot tea and a home-cooked
[4047.92 - 4052.56] meal that my husband and I prepared for
[4049.68 - 4055.40] her I wanted to support the situation as
[4052.56 - 4058.64] best I could at the time but nothing I'm
[4055.40 - 4059.60] telling you nothing that I did was good
[4058.64 - 4062.28] enough
[4059.60 - 4064.44] nothing I don't get that time back with
[4062.28 - 4066.64] my newborn I don't get to do it again I
[4064.44 - 4068.84] don't get to hold her again as a newborn
[4066.64 - 4071.32] I don't get to be there again with my
[4068.84 - 4074.48] two-year-old son I I went through all of
[4071.32 - 4077.72] this and that time is just it's gone
[4074.48 - 4080.80] it's passed and now I live with Ash
[4077.72 - 4084.08] trashing me whenever she
[4080.80 - 4088.84] chooses and continuing to disrupt your
[4084.08 - 4091.28] family time and it just seems really odd
[4088.84 - 4093.64] to me that you were the object of blame
[4091.28 - 4095.20] here and especially when you and your
[4093.64 - 4097.48] husband did as much as you could for
[4095.20 - 4099.80] Stephanie after just having a baby and
[4097.48 - 4101.84] not living that close to her it seems
[4099.80 - 4104.72] like over and over again throughout the
[4101.84 - 4109.36] whole Stephanie situation the plotters
[4104.72 - 4113.08] Ashley Robbie Taylor Christina Megan
[4109.36 - 4115.96] Tony Gretchen have tried to place blame
[4113.08 - 4118.20] on people who were actually trying to
[4115.96 - 4120.16] help yeah many of Stephanie's friends
[4118.20 - 4122.32] were just doing the best they could to
[4120.16 - 4124.16] help her when it was possible and that
[4122.32 - 4126.04] was all acceptable they were happy if
[4124.16 - 4127.68] someone donated some time or some energy
[4126.04 - 4130.48] or some food or whatever it was but
[4127.68 - 4132.32] somehow I was definitely a Target in the
[4130.48 - 4134.16] whole thing I was being pushed to do
[4132.32 - 4136.72] more and more and more and whatever I
[4134.16 - 4139.56] did it was not good good enough I did
[4136.72 - 4142.56] what I could in the situation I was in
[4139.56 - 4144.68] with a brand new baby somehow the
[4142.56 - 4147.24] 2-year-old little boy and the several
[4144.68 - 4149.56] week old little girl that I had in my
[4147.24 - 4151.24] arms while my husband was away at work
[4149.56 - 4152.76] was completely overlooked they just kept
[4151.24 - 4155.00] looking at me like I was some kind of
[4152.76 - 4158.48] robot that was supposed to go and do and
[4155.00 - 4163.52] do more and more it was
[4158.48 - 4165.52] horrible wow yeah wow and in reality I
[4163.52 - 4167.64] mean you were trying so hard to help
[4165.52 - 4170.32] Stephanie in an impossible situation on
[4167.64 - 4171.68] no sleep that you actually had gasoline
[4170.32 - 4175.16] sprayed all over you to the point that
[4171.68 - 4177.84] your hair was drenched and Ashley who
[4175.16 - 4180.96] was putting all this pressure on you was
[4177.84 - 4182.96] nowhere to be found and an exposure like
[4180.96 - 4186.12] that of getting straight gasoline
[4182.96 - 4189.24] sprayed all over your head all on your
[4186.12 - 4191.96] hair all over your body it's treacherous
[4189.24 - 4194.40] that much gasoline all on your body
[4191.96 - 4196.40] soaked on you like that gets absorbed
[4194.40 - 4199.08] into your breast milk milk you just had
[4196.40 - 4201.56] a baby and then your immune system is
[4199.08 - 4204.16] already comp compromised because you had
[4201.56 - 4208.08] a baby and then you yourself Kim were
[4204.16 - 4210.52] sick years ago this is a major exposure
[4208.08 - 4212.92] which could trigger your system and then
[4210.52 - 4215.44] if you were sitting in your car right
[4212.92 - 4218.68] after you just had gasoline dumped all
[4215.44 - 4222.44] over you if you had accidentally hit the
[4218.68 - 4224.64] car lighter with your elbow or your hand
[4222.44 - 4228.80] or your phone just by putting your phone
[4224.64 - 4232.12] down you could have gone up in Flames
[4228.80 - 4234.36] all it would take is just one spark from
[4232.12 - 4237.32] an electrical wire from just the
[4234.36 - 4239.72] ignition of the car starting and you
[4237.32 - 4242.64] would have burned up and died along with
[4239.72 - 4244.96] your baby in the car all because you're
[4242.64 - 4248.32] helping out a friend Stephanie while
[4244.96 - 4250.76] Ashley was sitting in Malibu in her
[4248.32 - 4253.48] multi-million dollar house and then
[4250.76 - 4255.76] spreading rumors and false claims about
[4253.48 - 4259.24] how you and Stephanie weren't even
[4255.76 - 4261.76] friends yeah not
[4259.24 - 4264.60] friends it actually haunts me Anthony
[4261.76 - 4267.44] the whole situation haunts me it was
[4264.60 - 4269.52] traumatic like truly traumatic for me
[4267.44 - 4272.60] and to have to live with the constant
[4269.52 - 4275.04] social media insults threats and stress
[4272.60 - 4277.44] it just brings it all up over and over
[4275.04 - 4280.56] and over again every single time I see
[4277.44 - 4282.84] her starting posting it's like the antic
[4280.56 - 4286.16] start and I just it it all comes up over
[4282.84 - 4290.20] and over again for me
[4286.16 - 4293.84] I'm so sorry Kim thanks Amber
[4290.20 - 4299.52] and yeah you you
[4293.84 - 4299.52] also it's awful yeah it's
[4299.96 - 4306.08] awful you also ended up unfortunately
[4303.40 - 4308.84] with an enlarged uterus because you were
[4306.08 - 4310.88] standing up constantly making food
[4308.84 - 4313.12] driving long distances before you were
[4310.88 - 4316.56] cleared to and bringing food to
[4313.12 - 4319.92] Stephanie instead of resting post partum
[4316.56 - 4320.84] and at the same time Ashley was nowhere
[4319.92 - 4324.36] to be
[4320.84 - 4326.20] found while you were going so far out of
[4324.36 - 4329.28] your way to help Stephanie that you
[4326.20 - 4332.24] risked your own life and your baby's
[4329.28 - 4334.60] life and sacrificed your body literally
[4332.24 - 4337.00] to help you did all of this because
[4334.60 - 4340.84] Stephanie was a close friend of
[4337.00 - 4344.44] yours and Ashley was nowhere to be found
[4340.84 - 4345.96] yet Ashley has the nerve and entitlement
[4344.44 - 4348.32] to imply that you weren't doing enough
[4345.96 - 4350.60] for Steph and that you weren't even a
[4348.32 - 4355.00] friend of hers at
[4350.60 - 4358.88] all Yeah Ashley always communicated as a
[4355.00 - 4361.64] very entitled manipulative woman I just
[4358.88 - 4363.32] didn't know to what extent back then
[4361.64 - 4365.48] that she was
[4363.32 - 4367.00] entitled um when we all flew out to
[4365.48 - 4369.32] Pebble Beach to stay in her family's
[4367.00 - 4371.88] home Stephanie actually didn't have the
[4369.32 - 4375.32] money to go and it was a really touchy
[4371.88 - 4378.36] subject but meanwhile Ashley the
[4375.32 - 4380.56] daughter of a billionaire family didn't
[4378.36 - 4383.64] offer support to her then I looked back
[4380.56 - 4385.84] at those emails wondering why did Ashley
[4383.64 - 4387.64] not just buy her a ticket if they were
[4385.84 - 4390.84] such good
[4387.64 - 4393.48] friends yeah it's a really great
[4390.84 - 4395.84] question and I looked through those
[4393.48 - 4398.76] emails there are a few I want to read
[4395.84 - 4401.36] off for everyone the first one was from
[4398.76 - 4404.56] Stephanie to everyone on the email
[4401.36 - 4407.68] thread that Ashley had invited to a
[4404.56 - 4411.40] weekend get get away it was sent on
[4407.68 - 4412.92] January 11th of 2017 just a few months
[4411.40 - 4416.88] before Stephanie discovered her breast
[4412.92 - 4420.36] lump and it says hey I'm still in the
[4416.88 - 4423.08] unknown territory if I can come or not
[4420.36 - 4424.76] financially at the moment not best
[4423.08 - 4427.36] however things could turn around and
[4424.76 - 4430.40] make it possible very quickly flight
[4427.36 - 4432.40] prices are low so that's a plus so I may
[4430.40 - 4435.60] have to wait as it gets closer to make a
[4432.40 - 4438.28] move is that okay
[4435.60 - 4440.20] this question was directed to Ashley and
[4438.28 - 4442.96] Stephanie said that flight prices are
[4440.20 - 4444.28] low but still too much for her to afford
[4442.96 - 4448.28] at the
[4444.28 - 4450.08] moment then on January 22nd of 2017
[4448.28 - 4451.96] Ashley sends an email to everyone in the
[4450.08 - 4454.04] group with a status update and some
[4451.96 - 4455.64] background information about each person
[4454.04 - 4459.12] for her friends who hadn't met each
[4455.64 - 4463.36] other before Ashley's update to everyone
[4459.12 - 4466.48] about Stephanie says this Stephanie
[4463.36 - 4470.40] possible Steph is trying to make it work
[4466.48 - 4472.68] financially I so want her to be there
[4470.40 - 4474.96] Steph is a wealth of information and a
[4472.68 - 4477.96] bright positive Shining Light in any
[4474.96 - 4480.32] group she's part of for dinner she likes
[4477.96 - 4483.44] to eat heads of Roma lettuce dipped in
[4480.32 - 4486.52] kind pepper and lemon if that's not next
[4483.44 - 4491.12] level I don't know what
[4486.52 - 4494.04] is I was shocked by this email because
[4491.12 - 4496.72] here Ashley is actually praising
[4494.04 - 4499.12] Stephanie for for eating only lettuce
[4496.72 - 4502.84] with cayenne and lemon for
[4499.12 - 4505.04] dinner as we've covered a lot obviously
[4502.84 - 4508.00] aead of lettuce as a meal let alone for
[4505.04 - 4510.20] dinner is not enough it is not MediCal
[4508.00 - 4513.08] medium information this is something
[4510.20 - 4516.24] Anthony absolutely advises against it
[4513.08 - 4519.72] was Stephanie's pre-existing approach to
[4516.24 - 4522.56] food that here we see Ashley praising
[4519.72 - 4524.12] and calling next level like restricting
[4522.56 - 4527.80] yourself is something that everyone
[4524.12 - 4530.16] should aspire to do and Ashley said in
[4527.80 - 4533.20] this email that she so wants Stephanie
[4530.16 - 4535.92] to be there Stephanie had said herself
[4533.20 - 4538.76] that flight prices were low at the time
[4535.92 - 4540.76] in 2017 flight prices were quite a bit
[4538.76 - 4542.32] cheaper than they are today I'm sure
[4540.76 - 4544.84] that she could have gotten a flight from
[4542.32 - 4547.40] Philly to La where Ashley suggested
[4544.84 - 4551.32] everyone to fly into from a Budget
[4547.40 - 4554.28] Airline for 99 to
[4551.32 - 4557.80] $150 Ashley is the daughter of a
[4554.28 - 4559.88] billionaire and has a trust fund as you
[4557.80 - 4561.56] said if Ashley was truly such great
[4559.88 - 4564.48] friends with Stephanie and really wanted
[4561.56 - 4566.64] Stephanie there why wouldn't Ashley have
[4564.48 - 4570.48] just gotten her the plane
[4566.64 - 4572.16] ticket yeah looking back I really do not
[4570.48 - 4574.60] understand it especially with all the
[4572.16 - 4576.12] finger pointing Ashley has done Ashley
[4574.60 - 4578.04] let her miss out because Stephanie
[4576.12 - 4579.44] couldn't afford it and then Ashley even
[4578.04 - 4581.08] asked everyone in the group who was
[4579.44 - 4583.44] coming to her family's multi-million
[4581.08 - 4586.44] dollar home for a weekend for a cleaning
[4583.44 - 4586.44] fee
[4586.52 - 4592.80] I saw that in the email
[4588.80 - 4596.80] thread unbelievable a cleaning
[4592.80 - 4599.40] fee so after the Pebble Beach thing just
[4596.80 - 4601.96] a few months later Stephanie discovers
[4599.40 - 4605.56] her breast lump in March and then she
[4601.96 - 4607.68] injures her back and then she gets sick
[4605.56 - 4609.24] during the time that Stephanie was Ill
[4607.68 - 4611.36] how would you describe Ashley's
[4609.24 - 4613.32] relationship with Stephanie's family do
[4611.36 - 4616.08] you know if they interacted were they
[4613.32 - 4618.60] close what was that like Ashley actually
[4616.08 - 4620.92] talked negatively about Stephanie's
[4618.60 - 4622.48] family there was this constant thing
[4620.92 - 4625.48] where the family wanted Stephanie to
[4622.48 - 4627.56] receive conventional Cancer Care and the
[4625.48 - 4630.24] plotters were not in agreement with the
[4627.56 - 4633.52] family's wishes Stephanie's personal
[4630.24 - 4636.12] wishes were pushed completely to the
[4633.52 - 4638.08] side at the time the plotters and the
[4636.12 - 4641.52] family were not on the same page at all
[4638.08 - 4644.92] so it's so unbelievably strange to me
[4641.52 - 4647.92] that now they've come together to blame
[4644.92 - 4649.56] and attack Anthony who wasn't even
[4647.92 - 4651.28] involved in Stephanie's Cancer Care
[4649.56 - 4653.68] because the family cut off communication
[4651.28 - 4655.60] with him it was a lot for me birthing a
[4653.68 - 4657.84] baby and trying to simultaneously
[4655.60 - 4661.04] support a friend who was not well and
[4657.84 - 4663.80] listening to Stephanie stress literally
[4661.04 - 4666.80] stress about her support people closest
[4663.80 - 4669.00] to her not getting along I was dealing
[4666.80 - 4671.28] with the text threads with the plotters
[4669.00 - 4674.40] that were trashing and fighting with her
[4671.28 - 4676.40] family it was horrendous seeing those
[4674.40 - 4679.36] same plotters who were disagreeing with
[4676.40 - 4682.60] and arguing with Stephanie's family now
[4679.36 - 4686.08] representing and advocating for them or
[4682.60 - 4688.64] with them is very confusing to me my own
[4686.08 - 4691.04] data clearly shows that there was a
[4688.64 - 4693.68] major issue between the platters and
[4691.04 - 4696.00] Stephanie's family my husband witnessed
[4693.68 - 4698.56] this in person when he went into the
[4696.00 - 4701.16] hospital to visit Stephanie the plotters
[4698.56 - 4706.44] and the family were not on the same
[4701.16 - 4708.08] page that's extremely interesting and is
[4706.44 - 4710.76] something that's very it's very
[4708.08 - 4713.80] confusing to think about that as well
[4710.76 - 4717.16] and how things somehow changed and
[4713.80 - 4719.44] flipped in that way and then what
[4717.16 - 4721.44] happened when your husband went to the
[4719.44 - 4723.44] hospital to visit and bring food to
[4721.44 - 4727.24] Stephanie what what did he
[4723.44 - 4729.60] see so my husband observed an argument
[4727.24 - 4732.08] between Taylor Stephanie and Stephanie's
[4729.60 - 4733.76] family Stephanie didn't want the
[4732.08 - 4735.24] treatment at the hospital that was being
[4733.76 - 4738.84] offered at that moment
[4735.24 - 4741.24] she was crying it's heartbreaking Taylor
[4738.84 - 4744.20] was on her team and she was fighting
[4741.24 - 4746.60] with the family Stephany wanted to go to
[4744.20 - 4749.64] Mexico for an alternative treatment but
[4746.60 - 4751.52] her family didn't agree to this my
[4749.64 - 4753.56] husband just wanted to have a genuine
[4751.52 - 4755.36] conversation with Stephanie the way that
[4753.56 - 4757.44] he had so many times in the past but it
[4755.36 - 4759.08] was uncomfortable and impossible because
[4757.44 - 4761.64] of this conflict that was going on while
[4759.08 - 4763.56] he was there instead he tried to be
[4761.64 - 4765.36] helpful and find creative ways to keep
[4763.56 - 4769.28] the food cold and be sure the juices
[4765.36 - 4771.40] were kept fresh for her but the family
[4769.28 - 4773.88] they always hated the way that she ate
[4771.40 - 4776.04] dating back years before Stephanie even
[4773.88 - 4778.68] knew Anthony the family did not like the
[4776.04 - 4780.12] way that she ate the family made my
[4778.68 - 4781.80] husband feel like he was a villain for
[4780.12 - 4783.40] bringing food to
[4781.80 - 4787.48] Stephanie
[4783.40 - 4789.64] wow so there was this massive ongoing
[4787.48 - 4793.44] battle between the plotters and the
[4789.64 - 4795.08] family completely independent of Anthony
[4793.44 - 4797.28] and just to bring this all together for
[4795.08 - 4799.72] everyone all Anthony ever did in this
[4797.28 - 4802.68] whole situation as we've shown was
[4799.72 - 4805.00] encourage Stephanie to see a doctor
[4802.68 - 4807.44] offer emotional support and try to get
[4805.00 - 4809.60] her up off the floor she got stuck on
[4807.44 - 4812.48] due to her injury so that she could get
[4809.60 - 4814.56] in for proper Medical Care Anthony was
[4812.48 - 4817.92] not Stephanie's health practitioner
[4814.56 - 4819.72] Anthony is not an oncologist in order to
[4817.92 - 4822.00] get diagnosed with cancer you need to
[4819.72 - 4824.40] see a board certified
[4822.00 - 4826.40] oncologist from the moment Stephanie
[4824.40 - 4828.92] discovered her breast lump she was
[4826.40 - 4831.16] repeatedly told by Anthony to see a
[4828.92 - 4833.36] physician if Stephanie had listened to
[4831.16 - 4834.04] Anthony's advice to see a doctor from
[4833.36 - 4836.40] the
[4834.04 - 4838.84] beginning outcomes probably would have
[4836.40 - 4840.92] been entirely different and we probably
[4838.84 - 4844.20] wouldn't need to be sitting here today
[4840.92 - 4846.60] to talk about this and you Kim you even
[4844.20 - 4849.16] talked with Stephanie early on about
[4846.60 - 4851.60] doctors she could see in the area that
[4849.16 - 4853.60] were near her and you said earlier on
[4851.60 - 4855.68] that Stephanie wasn't receptive to that
[4853.60 - 4858.32] at the time
[4855.68 - 4860.52] and so then Stephanie's battle with
[4858.32 - 4863.32] cancer ended up going on for about a
[4860.52 - 4867.36] year after Anthony was told aggressively
[4863.32 - 4870.32] to stay away during that time again
[4867.36 - 4872.12] independent of Anthony the plotters were
[4870.32 - 4874.68] fighting for Stephanie to get some kind
[4872.12 - 4876.72] of alternative treatment for her cancer
[4874.68 - 4879.00] while the family on the other hand
[4876.72 - 4881.88] wanted her to do conventional
[4879.00 - 4884.60] treatment while Stephanie was sick the
[4881.88 - 4888.44] plotters and the family were at odds
[4884.60 - 4890.24] Waring with each other and then when did
[4888.44 - 4892.56] things change when did you see the
[4890.24 - 4894.24] plotter start coming around and and
[4892.56 - 4896.52] coming together with the family to try
[4894.24 - 4899.48] to blame
[4896.52 - 4901.24] Anthony I honestly didn't see things
[4899.48 - 4903.48] change until years after Stephanie
[4901.24 - 4905.00] passed away months after Stephanie
[4903.48 - 4907.36] passed away I was invited to her
[4905.00 - 4910.64] celebration of life the plotters were
[4907.36 - 4912.32] offering Retreats yeah they were
[4910.64 - 4915.16] offering retreats to the medical medium
[4912.32 - 4917.36] community and then all of a sudden
[4915.16 - 4920.40] the pters changed their tune it was
[4917.36 - 4923.28] literally overnight and to me that seems
[4920.40 - 4928.80] so clear that an agenda was
[4923.28 - 4931.20] born yeah it's pretty crazy and then I
[4928.80 - 4933.64] want to bring it back to when Stephanie
[4931.20 - 4935.60] was Ill when you went to go bring
[4933.64 - 4938.12] Stephanie food at the time that she was
[4935.60 - 4940.20] living in her family's home what was
[4938.12 - 4942.08] that experience like for you I went to
[4940.20 - 4944.20] Stephanie's family's home to pick
[4942.08 - 4945.08] Gretchen up who was going to stay in my
[4944.20 - 4946.96] home
[4945.08 - 4948.92] Gretchen was using my husband's car but
[4946.96 - 4951.48] on that day he had to travel for work so
[4948.92 - 4953.76] I drove to pick her up I was drenched
[4951.48 - 4955.48] and gasolin by the time that I got there
[4953.76 - 4958.04] and needed to take a shower and rinse
[4955.48 - 4960.28] off as quickly as possible I showered in
[4958.04 - 4962.52] one of Stephanie's family's bathrooms it
[4960.28 - 4964.44] was really scary time for me I had my
[4962.52 - 4966.32] newborn baby and I brought her in her
[4964.44 - 4968.60] little car seat because Stephanie wanted
[4966.32 - 4970.52] to meet her she actually wasn't able to
[4968.60 - 4973.64] hold the baby due to the drugs that she
[4970.52 - 4975.84] was on I dropped off some food for her
[4973.64 - 4977.92] and was just in shocked from all that
[4975.84 - 4980.40] happened with the gasoline and all that
[4977.92 - 4982.20] was happening around me in that moment
[4980.40 - 4984.52] it was around the same time when I was
[4982.20 - 4986.52] told by Gretchen that she had observed
[4984.52 - 4988.44] Stephanie with dust bunnies on her head
[4986.52 - 4991.00] and face and that Gretchen had to dust
[4988.44 - 4992.88] her off when she arrived in her home my
[4991.00 - 4994.16] heart was broken and honestly it still
[4992.88 - 4996.44] is
[4994.16 - 4999.64] Amber that is
[4996.44 - 5002.72] horrifying and the fact that it was
[4999.64 - 5005.24] Gretchen who is now a plotter who saw
[5002.72 - 5006.84] the dust situation is
[5005.24 - 5009.32] especially
[5006.84 - 5011.56] interesting yeah it was horrible all of
[5009.32 - 5013.36] it the the whole situation was horrible
[5011.56 - 5015.88] it was so hard to see it was hard to
[5013.36 - 5017.40] hear it was hard to experience and all
[5015.88 - 5019.52] at the same time with everything that I
[5017.40 - 5022.36] had going on I felt so terrible for
[5019.52 - 5023.72] Stephanie and I couldn't understand why
[5022.36 - 5027.08] and everything that she was going
[5023.72 - 5030.04] through that she would be covered in
[5027.08 - 5031.64] dust yeah yeah that's something that's
[5030.04 - 5034.84] really hard for me to wrap my head
[5031.64 - 5037.96] around as well and
[5034.84 - 5041.48] so then at some point when Stephanie was
[5037.96 - 5044.92] sick Taylor Who's now also a plotter
[5041.48 - 5046.96] stepped in could you explain what your
[5044.92 - 5049.04] experience was like with her and what
[5046.96 - 5052.16] role Taylor
[5049.04 - 5054.12] played so Taylor was one of the ones
[5052.16 - 5057.48] arguing at the hospital she basically
[5054.12 - 5060.28] took over but she also was not fond of
[5057.48 - 5063.20] the family and they were not F of her
[5060.28 - 5065.04] Taylor was in charge though or at least
[5063.20 - 5068.28] she thought she was in charge of the
[5065.04 - 5071.08] whole situation she was so manipulative
[5068.28 - 5073.64] and so bossy on the text messages and on
[5071.08 - 5076.16] the phone I had never even met her in
[5073.64 - 5078.32] person like have never met this woman
[5076.16 - 5080.56] ever yet she was calling me out and
[5078.32 - 5082.72] saying I needed to do more even though I
[5080.56 - 5085.32] had a newborn and I remember thinking
[5082.72 - 5086.84] that she was really insensitive and mean
[5085.32 - 5088.60] and I didn't and and she just didn't
[5086.84 - 5090.64] realize I'm like does this woman realize
[5088.60 - 5093.00] I have a newborn right now she she just
[5090.64 - 5096.16] didn't
[5093.00 - 5098.00] understand yeah that that description
[5096.16 - 5100.16] especially the bossiness matches a lot
[5098.00 - 5102.28] of the experiences that I had with
[5100.16 - 5105.56] Taylor several months ago in
[5102.28 - 5108.60] person um so so Stephanie was in a
[5105.56 - 5110.64] vulnerable position her back injury
[5108.60 - 5113.00] prevented her from being able to do much
[5110.64 - 5115.04] herself she was having a hard time
[5113.00 - 5117.04] getting the food that she needed you
[5115.04 - 5120.68] said earlier that she wasn't really
[5117.04 - 5123.00] making her own decisions Taylor who was
[5120.68 - 5125.08] acting you know as her caretaker and
[5123.00 - 5127.28] Stephanie's family were making a lot of
[5125.08 - 5128.84] decisions for her you were being
[5127.28 - 5131.72] supportive and trying to help out as
[5128.84 - 5134.08] best as you could did you and Stephanie
[5131.72 - 5137.68] stay in touch throughout the course of
[5134.08 - 5139.88] her illness or how did that go so for a
[5137.68 - 5142.00] long time we were in Daily communication
[5139.88 - 5143.48] personally and also in group chats with
[5142.00 - 5146.52] various different plotters that were
[5143.48 - 5148.36] discussing Stephanie's situation all of
[5146.52 - 5150.72] a sudden out of the blue Stephanie
[5148.36 - 5152.24] stopped responding to me I was told by
[5150.72 - 5154.92] Gretchen that her brother took her phone
[5152.24 - 5157.28] away and I never heard from her
[5154.92 - 5159.68] again I was also removed from the group
[5157.28 - 5161.76] chats it was very very weird because
[5159.68 - 5164.44] Stephanie normally would text a lot and
[5161.76 - 5167.12] send a lot of audio messages and all of
[5164.44 - 5169.28] that I was again newly postpartum so
[5167.12 - 5171.80] swallowing this was all really hard and
[5169.28 - 5174.52] I was just trying to survive and feeling
[5171.80 - 5179.08] completely heartbroken at the same
[5174.52 - 5181.76] time wow yeah so you were told by
[5179.08 - 5185.60] Gretchen that Stephanie's brother took
[5181.76 - 5185.60] Stephanie's phone away
[5185.80 - 5190.84] wow and we actually have text messages
[5188.72 - 5192.20] and audio recordings corroborating what
[5190.84 - 5195.12] you just said that we'll be sharing in
[5192.20 - 5197.56] another episode it's really sad that you
[5195.12 - 5199.60] had the same experience as other friends
[5197.56 - 5202.08] of Stephanie's who were either cut off
[5199.60 - 5204.56] without explanation or were told that
[5202.08 - 5207.12] they were not allowed to speak with her
[5204.56 - 5209.32] yeah and then I'm also curious about
[5207.12 - 5211.80] your experience with Stephanie before
[5209.32 - 5215.12] she got sick what were Stephanie's
[5211.80 - 5217.04] eating habits like before she got sick
[5215.12 - 5219.36] so actually shocking to me as someone
[5217.04 - 5221.76] that eats a very clean diet which has
[5219.36 - 5223.12] reversed my own symptoms years ago I I
[5221.76 - 5225.72] was actually shocked when I met
[5223.12 - 5228.32] Stephanie for lunch or at a juice bar
[5225.72 - 5230.32] she wouldn't eat it was very rare that
[5228.32 - 5232.36] she would eat something she mostly
[5230.32 - 5235.40] wouldn't eat at all not even at a
[5232.36 - 5238.68] completely organic juice bar one time I
[5235.40 - 5242.08] actually had a car full of fresh organic
[5238.68 - 5243.88] produce like wholesale produce fresh and
[5242.08 - 5246.32] she wouldn't touch any of the fruit and
[5243.88 - 5248.20] she would eat only the lettuce and I
[5246.32 - 5252.80] just always felt like she was starving
[5248.20 - 5252.80] and it just it just broke my
[5253.20 - 5259.20] heart yeah so you experienced Stephanie
[5256.04 - 5261.84] having some pre-existing problems with
[5259.20 - 5265.16] food just eating lettuce is definitely
[5261.84 - 5268.12] not MediCal medium information and it's
[5265.16 - 5270.56] really sad frankly yeah and
[5268.12 - 5273.28] yeah this goes along with so much
[5270.56 - 5276.28] evidence that we have of what Stephanie
[5273.28 - 5279.48] was eating and not eating which is the
[5276.28 - 5282.68] exact opposite of the story Ashley tried
[5279.48 - 5284.56] to tell starting in 2020 about Stephanie
[5282.68 - 5285.32] following medical medium information to
[5284.56 - 5288.88] a
[5285.32 - 5291.32] te so Ashley's told many false stories
[5288.88 - 5294.16] about Stephanie and many other things
[5291.32 - 5296.56] and now you've heard all the different
[5294.16 - 5299.76] iterations of the infamous cat story we
[5296.56 - 5303.04] shared earlier on in this podcast series
[5299.76 - 5305.76] Ashley told me directly in my calls with
[5303.04 - 5309.08] her that Anthony had put her on a
[5305.76 - 5310.20] fat-free raw diet and completely missed
[5309.08 - 5313.44] the cat
[5310.20 - 5316.04] allergy however one of the true
[5313.44 - 5318.92] versions of that cat story came from a
[5316.04 - 5322.48] text conversation Ashley had with you on
[5318.92 - 5324.64] September 14th of 2018 which was months
[5322.48 - 5326.96] after she had given away their pet cat
[5324.64 - 5330.52] because in fact Anthony had said that
[5326.96 - 5333.48] the cat was part of the problem in
[5330.52 - 5335.40] Ashley's text to you Ashley said that
[5333.48 - 5338.56] Anthony told her to cut out nuts and
[5335.40 - 5341.64] seeds specifically for her son's eczema
[5338.56 - 5344.00] but that fats like olive oil were
[5341.64 - 5346.20] okay she also said to you that Anthony
[5344.00 - 5347.84] had recommended lots of squash which is
[5346.20 - 5350.88] something that would be cooked of course
[5347.84 - 5352.72] not raw so Ashley obviously was not put
[5350.88 - 5356.36] on a fat-free raw
[5352.72 - 5359.60] diet yeah this one is really crazy to
[5356.36 - 5361.72] hear so many versions of this story
[5359.60 - 5364.84] Ashley and I were actually talking about
[5361.72 - 5367.12] this because my daughter had skin issues
[5364.84 - 5368.96] temporarily directly following my
[5367.12 - 5370.52] exposure to all the gasoline that I was
[5368.96 - 5373.72] sprayed with while I was breastfeeding
[5370.52 - 5375.44] her I have texts from Ashley saying that
[5373.72 - 5377.48] Anthony told her to cut out nuts and
[5375.44 - 5379.88] seeds specifically because of the
[5377.48 - 5382.64] Arginine and that other fats like olive
[5379.88 - 5384.92] oil were okay and cooked squashes were
[5382.64 - 5387.36] okay and that he suggested bringing in
[5384.92 - 5389.80] cooked squashes again along with
[5387.36 - 5394.32] bringing in lots of green
[5389.80 - 5395.48] juices yeah okay so
[5394.32 - 5399.28] now I'm
[5395.48 - 5401.24] wondering it's I mean years ago Ashley
[5399.28 - 5402.84] in all all these false stories I'm sure
[5401.24 - 5404.36] Ashley years ago told you a lot of the
[5402.84 - 5406.96] false stories that we've debunked in
[5404.36 - 5409.60] these podcasts like the origin of the
[5406.96 - 5412.36] breast lump Discovery and the infamous
[5409.60 - 5414.76] cat story and it's got to feel really
[5412.36 - 5416.92] weird to look back and realize that you
[5414.76 - 5418.84] too were told so many untrue stories
[5416.92 - 5421.40] that were Ashley's foundational building
[5418.84 - 5424.40] blocks to get Robbie and the others on
[5421.40 - 5426.56] board to try to take down the medical
[5424.40 - 5428.80] medium Community it has been really
[5426.56 - 5431.24] upsetting to see this story evolve after
[5428.80 - 5433.84] seeing Ashley tell her healing story at
[5431.24 - 5435.40] the medical medium live event I know
[5433.84 - 5438.04] some of you remember it or you remember
[5435.40 - 5442.68] hearing about it Ashley herself was
[5438.04 - 5445.04] suffering and I mean really suffering
[5442.68 - 5448.12] and hearing her words firsthand and
[5445.04 - 5451.16] seeing her life turn around and now for
[5448.12 - 5454.16] her to do this it doesn't make much
[5451.16 - 5456.60] sense to me the very information that
[5454.16 - 5460.20] saved her life and these are her words
[5456.60 - 5462.60] not mine and Sav my life and several of
[5460.20 - 5465.68] the other practitioners were
[5462.60 - 5468.60] plotters and now to twist it and to
[5465.68 - 5473.12] trash it and to manipulate it into an
[5468.60 - 5476.84] article and into an agenda is just
[5473.12 - 5480.16] upsetting she has been trying so hard to
[5476.84 - 5482.60] convince everyone out there of things
[5480.16 - 5484.52] that are simply not true about Anthony
[5482.60 - 5486.24] and about this situation
[5484.52 - 5488.72] she tried to Corner me and make me
[5486.24 - 5491.16] believe things that are not true Anthony
[5488.72 - 5493.36] saved my life and I've watched thousands
[5491.16 - 5496.64] of Miracles over the years thanks to
[5493.36 - 5499.88] this information there is such a clear
[5496.64 - 5501.84] agenda here and I actually feel really
[5499.88 - 5504.52] bad for everyone who has been swallowed
[5501.84 - 5507.36] up by this so many of them have been
[5504.52 - 5510.96] saved by this same information thanks to
[5507.36 - 5514.04] Anthony and I know very personally that
[5510.96 - 5518.08] he has helped most of these plotters
[5514.04 - 5522.28] some of them in their Darkest Hour even
[5518.08 - 5524.80] after Stephanie's death even when they
[5522.28 - 5527.44] have walked away from the information
[5524.80 - 5529.00] but that just tells you who Anthony
[5527.44 - 5530.84] is
[5529.00 - 5534.72] yeah
[5530.84 - 5538.04] wow I just have to say how sorry I am
[5534.72 - 5540.08] again that Ashley targeted you and your
[5538.04 - 5542.52] family came the way that she did in so
[5540.08 - 5545.00] many different instances she clearly
[5542.52 - 5547.52] didn't know the facts about this story
[5545.00 - 5548.56] she just felt entitled apparently to say
[5547.52 - 5551.48] whatever she
[5548.56 - 5553.60] wanted she said herself in her text to
[5551.48 - 5554.88] you that she didn't care about any of
[5553.60 - 5557.92] the people in the medical medium
[5554.88 - 5561.20] Community who she hurt with her 2020
[5557.92 - 5562.96] posts if Ashley had genuine questions or
[5561.20 - 5565.40] concerns about what had happened with
[5562.96 - 5567.52] Stephanie if she had any real interest
[5565.40 - 5570.00] in pursuing the truth she could have
[5567.52 - 5573.36] asked Anthony about anything she never
[5570.00 - 5574.36] did she could have asked you she never
[5573.36 - 5577.92] did
[5574.36 - 5579.88] she decided to take it public only a few
[5577.92 - 5581.76] months after still trying to sell the
[5579.88 - 5584.52] medical medium community on herself
[5581.76 - 5588.36] self-proclaimed expensive Retreats with
[5584.52 - 5590.60] celery juice and a weight loss plan she
[5588.36 - 5592.76] tried to act like some kind of hero or
[5590.60 - 5596.24] whistleblower when she used a completely
[5592.76 - 5598.72] false story Ashley exploited Stephanie
[5596.24 - 5602.56] and her private information which is the
[5598.72 - 5604.60] saddest part yeah she caused outrage and
[5602.56 - 5607.32] Chaos in the medical medium Community
[5604.60 - 5609.48] with her false stories she put you and
[5607.32 - 5611.76] others in a situation where you'd have
[5609.48 - 5614.16] to defend the truth and then she had the
[5611.76 - 5617.00] nerve to attack you for
[5614.16 - 5619.36] it yeah she attacked my family my
[5617.00 - 5621.04] children my profession and I just want
[5619.36 - 5624.24] to talk about her weight loss book for a
[5621.04 - 5626.40] second twisting the information and
[5624.24 - 5629.56] claiming to be an expert Beyond
[5626.40 - 5631.28] Anthony's books I don't quite understand
[5629.56 - 5635.00] it Amber but I can tell you that it
[5631.28 - 5638.16] confused a lot of people Ashley's ebook
[5635.00 - 5640.92] was targeting postpartum women and it
[5638.16 - 5644.64] was a weight loss plan with portion
[5640.92 - 5646.56] sizes in ounce amounts I consulted with
[5644.64 - 5649.40] a lot of postpartum women who were
[5646.56 - 5651.48] influenced by Ashley's ebook to eat less
[5649.40 - 5654.52] food and restrict their calories as a
[5651.48 - 5655.96] means of rapid weight loss they were
[5654.52 - 5657.40] under the impression that they were
[5655.96 - 5659.36] still following medical medium
[5657.40 - 5662.56] information when medical medium
[5659.36 - 5664.44] information does not restrict calories
[5662.56 - 5665.84] they were just following Ashley's
[5664.44 - 5668.24] Twisted
[5665.84 - 5670.32] information a lot of these women had
[5668.24 - 5672.24] their supply of breast milk drop because
[5670.32 - 5673.88] they were not eating enough and some of
[5672.24 - 5676.16] them even blamed medical medium
[5673.88 - 5678.12] information for that when it it wasn't
[5676.16 - 5680.76] medical medium information it was
[5678.12 - 5682.84] Ashley's portion controlled information
[5680.76 - 5684.76] that she was marketing to the community
[5682.84 - 5686.84] and it was so
[5684.76 - 5690.44] irresponsible Ashley has done a lot of
[5686.84 - 5695.36] damage I'm hurt and lost I'm traumatized
[5690.44 - 5695.36] by all of it and I just want it to stop
[5695.40 - 5699.72] yeah yeah that's crazy that you've had
[5698.00 - 5703.40] that you had those direct experiences
[5699.72 - 5706.48] and uh with the impact that
[5703.40 - 5709.76] Ashley's that her weight loss ebook had
[5706.48 - 5712.40] on women particularly postpartum women
[5709.76 - 5714.68] in the community that's extremely sad
[5712.40 - 5718.20] and Ashley really is the originator of
[5714.68 - 5720.84] twisting medical medium information and
[5718.20 - 5724.16] um she's had a lot of influence on how
[5720.84 - 5726.24] that's happened in more recent times
[5724.16 - 5730.44] even you know with other people in other
[5726.24 - 5733.16] cases and it's all really sad and Ashley
[5730.44 - 5735.04] has indeed done a lot of damage and
[5733.16 - 5737.24] that's why it's so important that we're
[5735.04 - 5739.44] here you know to set the record straight
[5737.24 - 5742.68] to help stop Ashley and the plotters
[5739.44 - 5744.84] from misleading deceiving hurting or
[5742.68 - 5747.36] taking the chance to heal away from
[5744.84 - 5748.96] anyone else so thank you very much Kim
[5747.36 - 5750.64] for coming on I know that you're a busy
[5748.96 - 5753.12] mom of three little ones and that this
[5750.64 - 5754.56] wasn't easy to do I really appreciate
[5753.12 - 5757.40] you being here and sharing a lot of
[5754.56 - 5760.48] these really difficult experiences and I
[5757.40 - 5762.64] appreciate both of you very much it's
[5760.48 - 5765.04] unfortunate that we had to get together
[5762.64 - 5767.20] for something like this setting the
[5765.04 - 5770.28] record straight I'm sure the medical
[5767.20 - 5772.40] medium community and anyone even outside
[5770.28 - 5774.88] of the medical medium Community truly
[5772.40 - 5778.12] appreciates your caring and willingness
[5774.88 - 5780.48] to get the truth out there thank you Kim
[5778.12 - 5784.80] thank you guys I appreciate you
[5780.48 - 5787.12] both thanks thanks
[5784.80 - 5789.84] as we are in the process of exposing
[5787.12 - 5792.28] Ashley and her organized hateful group
[5789.84 - 5794.32] for who and what they really are it's
[5792.28 - 5796.92] important to take note of their tactics
[5794.32 - 5798.88] and patterns that are likely to follow
[5796.92 - 5801.64] the plotters have a documented history
[5798.88 - 5803.84] of initiating attacks using lies and
[5801.64 - 5806.48] misinformation and then upon getting
[5803.84 - 5809.32] called out and corrected trying to flip
[5806.48 - 5812.08] it and play victim that is not going to
[5809.32 - 5814.88] work here all this group has done is
[5812.08 - 5816.72] spread verifiable lies and falsities
[5814.88 - 5819.36] they've carelessly attacked and harmed
[5816.72 - 5821.12] many innocent people they've used and
[5819.36 - 5822.80] exploited deceased individuals and
[5821.12 - 5825.40] others in the process of trying to get
[5822.80 - 5827.92] what they want they've repeatedly
[5825.40 - 5829.84] explicitly expressed the intent to harm
[5827.92 - 5831.56] medical medium and they've even
[5829.84 - 5833.76] deliberately tried to stop Anthony from
[5831.56 - 5836.48] doing a free event to support and raise
[5833.76 - 5838.64] money for the community we have every
[5836.48 - 5841.08] right to set the record straight and to
[5838.64 - 5842.96] defend the truth with facts and evidence
[5841.08 - 5845.12] and to defend the chronically ill
[5842.96 - 5848.60] against the icious attacks of this group
[5845.12 - 5851.60] and we are going to continue to do so we
[5848.60 - 5853.96] expect the plotters to evade and ignore
[5851.60 - 5856.96] what they have done wrong we expect them
[5853.96 - 5859.16] to continue to lie and spread falsities
[5856.96 - 5862.04] we expect them to Pivot onto something
[5859.16 - 5865.20] new they'll make up and we expect them
[5862.04 - 5867.64] to skew and alter data and to hide
[5865.20 - 5870.48] critical pieces of evidence that
[5867.64 - 5872.72] undermines their entire campaign we also
[5870.48 - 5874.20] expect the plotters to fabricate
[5872.72 - 5876.40] explanation
[5874.20 - 5878.92] as they do everything they can to try to
[5876.40 - 5883.20] discredit what we're exposing them for
[5878.92 - 5885.68] having done and said in their own words
[5883.20 - 5889.48] but we are using their own text messages
[5885.68 - 5892.32] voice messages social media posts words
[5889.48 - 5894.76] that they spoke on recorded calls and
[5892.32 - 5897.92] other published materials there's no use
[5894.76 - 5901.24] of any AI in any of these episodes and
[5897.92 - 5903.72] never will be all of the information was
[5901.24 - 5905.96] fact checked and forensically invested
