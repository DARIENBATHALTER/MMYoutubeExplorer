4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,559
most advanced healing information and

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,120

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,040
not found anywhere else and is decades

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,720
ahead of what's out there now as I've

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,960
always said who has 10 or 20 30 years to

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,320
wait to find out what's causing their

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,359
cystitis because that's strep related

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,880
what's causing their sinusitis that's

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,320
chronic where you have to get surgeries

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,960
all the time that chronic strep what's

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,280
causing your

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,120
utti that strep a cacus really elusive

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,719
really hard to discover or to diagnose

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,200
you know you can go to an ENT they're

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,000
not going to know what's going on they

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,360
might say it's bacteria they might say

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,120
we don't know it's

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,680
inflammation but strep is rampant we're

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,520
going to talk about it today and and we

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,480
don't have time to waste in the sense

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,920
where if you've suffered with this if

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,960
you dealt with it I know people have

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,840
dealt with sinus problems for years it

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,119
it's it can be tragic for a lot of

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,920
people without a doubt sinus congestion

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,560
sinus pain chronic sinus infection ear

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,600
infections otitis media that's you know

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,600
the ear infection in the middle ear

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,280
caused by strep okay

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,840
UTI gastric problems meaning intestinal

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,600
disorders sibo all this is Strep so if

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,479
you just logged on you better hang on

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,079
for the ride cuz today is a big day and

37
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:32,560
you want want to hear this show there's

38
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,479
no doubt about it because we're talking

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,880
about strepa cacus revealed strepa cacus

40
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:39,799
is an opportunistic bacteria that causes

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,040
far more health problems than medical

42
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,360
science and research currently know and

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,960
I'll talk about how strep is behind UTI

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,000
like I said before sore throats

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,439
digestive issues sibos sinus infections

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,360
and more so that's what we're talking

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,240
about today I'm excited about this

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,840
because so many people are lost with

49
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,759
this there they don't know what's

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,200
causing their societ is they don't know

51
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,920
that it was the strep throat they had

52
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,399
when they were 8 years old and then when

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,720
they're 35 years old and they got cystis

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,920
they don't know that that's what it is

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,640
it's still strep and strep has this

56
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,760
interesting pattern we're going to talk

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,360
about so we're going to talk about the

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,239
pattern of what it does and how it works

59
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,200
also what it's related to as well what

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,760
it's related to so that's a whole

61
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,879
another thing and uh we got lots to

62
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,519
cover and also have you locked down a

63
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,840
copy of life-changing Foods

64
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,319
um that is going to be so fun when you

65
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,840
guys open that book you're going to be

66
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:42,239
blown away and and unless I'm wrong but

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,519
I don't think I'm wrong about this we

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,800
painstakingly spirit and I painstakingly

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,480
put information in this book that even

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,400
supersedes the show I do here by far and

71
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,400
we really really knocked it out of the

72
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,879
park like we didn't hold back I didn't

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,920
care what it took I didn't care how many

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,239
nights I stayed up I didn't care how

75
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,239
many nights my brain was mush and

76
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,920
frazzled from taking data for hours and

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,560
hours and hours from Spirit to make sure

78
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,920
that we know all the diseases and

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,080
conditions that fruits and vegetables

80
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,319
herbs and spices and wild foods can help

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,760
us recover from if they're used the

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,080
right way including emotional levels

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,120
what it can do for Spiritual lessons we

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040
can get from it it is definitely

85
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,120
interesting and so make sure you look

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,720
into that I'm excited about that I'm I'm

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,439
I'm giggly I'm because when you open

88
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,760
those when you open that book you're

89
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:41,040
going to be you're going to be shocked

90
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,840
and and that and I'm excited about it

91
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,080
because it's it was well worth the the

92
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,680
the pain of putting it together so I'm

93
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,840
so excited um anyway and a little bit

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,239
about me if this is your first show um

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,720
before we go on about strep and

96
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,239
everything and just if if this is your

97
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,120
first show started at age four um

98
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,680
diagnosed my grandmother of lung cancer

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,640
by hearing a voice perfectly clear that

100
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,840
said Grandma has lung cancer pronounced

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,680
it it took a couple of times to

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,439
pronounce it at the dinner table and uh

103
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,720
everybody's forks and knives dropped at

104
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,879
on the plates uh there was some Shock

105
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,519
going on some Shock value going on from

106
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,639
a four-year-old telling Grandma she had

107
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,840
lung cancer and then Weeks Later brought

108
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,919
her in and she did and that was the

109
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,720
start of what happened and it never

110
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,759
stopped and I've dedicated my entire

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,600
life of bringing truthful information

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,400
not

113
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,280
misinformation truthful information so

114
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,000
people can find their way out of the

115
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,440
darkness of misinformation because it's

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,880
one of the greatest things that holds us

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,880
back in healing all of our conditions

118
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,759
and it's also why millions of people

119
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,199
stay sick because the truth is not out

120
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,639
there in so many ways so I've dedicated

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,479
my life and and and decades and helping

122
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,199
tens of thousands of people with the

123
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,680
right information so that 30 years later

124
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,199
they're living a life right now

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,400
healthier than they ever did 30 years

126
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,320
ago and you know and this is this is

127
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,320
what what I've dedicated my life doing

128
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,360
and I've see it all the time you guys

129
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,280
people coming to me like sick for 3

130
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
years with with something that no one

131
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,039
can figure out sick for four years that

132
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,560
no one can figure out and then it gets

133
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,600
all the different labels and they still

134
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,639
stay sick and it's it's okay it's cute

135
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,199
and fuzzy to throw labels on people like

136
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,759
Lyme disease and everything else but if

137
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,960
they're not getting better or if they

138
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,080
keep on getting sick do you really know

139
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,360
what was wrong with them to begin with

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,160
and that's that's where we clear the air

141
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,080

142

167
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,039
let's go into this so it starts out

168
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,360
interesting with strep it starts out

169
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
interesting when we're we're meaning

170
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,080
like it's it's a it's it's the whole

171
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,080
thing with strep starts out when we're

172
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,880
young most of the time and I'm going to

173
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,120
talk about what I mean by that see most

174
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,400
of the time it starts out when we're

175
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,080
little and we're young we usually pick

176
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,520
it up from a some place we either get it

177
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,199
from Mommy we can get it from Daddy okay

178
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,039
so let's not just blame moms uh blame

179
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,440
moms on for everything okay moms have

180
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,039
enough guilt on them they have they have

181
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,560
enough of that guilt where it's Mother's

182
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,039
guilt for you know for for nothing the

183
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,879
mothers have done wrong it's just the

184
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,520
guilt's naturally built in it's

185
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,360
naturally there when you have children

186
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,919
you just feel feel this and so it starts

187
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,199
out when we're younger and it can come

188
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:18,680
from Mom it can come from Dad it can

189
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,479
come from

190
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,800
anywhere and it can come from other

191
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:28,759
children it could come

192
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,599
from bathrooms strep is really tricky

193
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,240
and what it does is we get our strep

194
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,840
infections we get our strep throat When

195
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,199
We're Young And even if we don't get

196
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,639
diagnosed with strep throat we can have

197
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,039
strep in US causing sore throat that's

198
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,479
not diagnosed with strep throat we can

199
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,759
have strep inness that's causing chronic

200
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:46,960
ear infections all the time otitis media

201
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:52,199
um inner ear infection you station Tu

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,840
infections all of this is strap related

203
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,759
now there is some Epstein bars but they

204
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,680
connect to strep strep is the co-actor

205
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,039
of Epstein bar by the way and um but

206
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
there is some Epstein bars that cause

207
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,199
ear problems we talked about that tentis

208
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,639
we talk about that you know hearing loss

209
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,400
all this other things popping in the

210
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,000
ears fuzzing buzzing reading ringing

211
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,240
it's you know it's all Epstein bar

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,159
related but the otitis media the ear

213
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,240
infections kids get that's mostly shrap

214
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:22,759
and and what happens is streps a

215
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:27,800
bacteria and it's getting stronger and

216
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:31,280
stronger Each decade it's turning closer

217
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,240
to that super Super Bug level not quite

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,959
there yet but it's getting there strep

219
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,440
is not all the same strain either it's

220
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,440
not and you know this I've seen this

221
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,240
occur with a lot of relationships you

222
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,080
got young adults that are in one

223
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,880
relationship and we share our bacteria

224
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,880
in a relationship that's what we do so

225
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,560
when we lock down a relationship and we

226
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,399
have you know we're in a relationship

227
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,680
for 2 years we're starting our life and

228
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,920
then and then you know we're sharing our

229
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,000
bacteria

230
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,160
that's how it works and in that bacteria

231
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,720
is usually one or two varieties of strep

232
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,360
so someone can have one variety the

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,560
other partner can have one variety and

234
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,880
then we have two varieties and we're

235
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,760
kind of passing it back and forth and

236
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,959
living life and enjoying life and we

237
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,399
have the strep but when relationships

238
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,160
don't work out and we find other

239
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,160
partners because life is hard the road

240
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,720
is hard we can run into some different

241
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,440
varieties of strep I've seen people with

242
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,360
multiple varieties of streps some can

243
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,800
become

244
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,399
anti-biotic resistant all all of them

245
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,560
actually are becoming antibiotic

246
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,200
resistant and so this is the whole thing

247
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,720
with strep somebody can have strep in

248
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,600
their sinuses a variety of strep in

249
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,440
their sinuses and then they can pick up

250
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,279
a new variety of strep later on in their

251
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,680
life and have the worst UTI they ever

252
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,360
had in their life and that can be

253
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,000
another variety of strep and it could be

254
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,360
more

255
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,120
resistant acne is caused by strep and

256
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,279
the reason why acne suffers suffer

257
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,920
suffer for long term is because it's a

258
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,920
bacterial infection

259
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,560
and it's usually treated with

260
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,560
antibiotics to begin with and people

261
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,040
with acne usually had antibiotics a lot

262
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,079
when they were a child for different

263
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,640
things lung infections bronchitis you

264
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,839
know antibiotics instead of using

265
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,920
natural means to heal bronchitis natural

266
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
means we get thrown to the doctors

267
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,000
pediatricians just keep on giving the

268
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,160
kids antibiotics for every little thing

269
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,079
they have without teaching mommies how

270
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
to care for their kids naturally with

271
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:31,000
gold and seal and vitamin C and

272
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,519
Sovereign Silver and and zinc and you

273
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,200
know lomatium root and Elderberry and

274
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,959
Thyme and and you know so so moms aren't

275
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,839
taught how to take care of their kids in

276
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,279
this day and age so it doesn't really

277
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,600
exist yet we're not there yet so what it

278
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,240
is is you know you're a child you you

279
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
got a earache you get thrown into the

280
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,560
doctor's office you get given an

281
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,320
antibiotic and the strep gets stronger

282
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,360
it gets stronger even if it goes away in

283
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,279
that moment it comes back stronger with

284
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,480
another bad ear infection it could even

285
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,000
go into pneumonia monia it can even go

286
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,519
into you know chronic bronchitis it can

287
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
go into chronic

288
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,839
sinusitis and it can grow and grow and

289
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,639
grow it could get into the gut cause

290
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:14,839
sibo more antibiotics for sibo sibo

291
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,399
calms down goes away comes back raining

292
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,240
your day stronger I can't say how many

293
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,480
people where the doctors that the the

294
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,959
functional medicine doctors are like

295
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,760
here we do antibiotics for that sibo

296
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,920
yeah stupidest thing you could ever do

297
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,000
and I'm not saying the doctors are

298
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,760
stupid that's not at all they're

299
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,200
brilliant people don't get me wrong

300
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,480
brilliant it's just that no one's no

301
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,000
one's talking about the right

302
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,480
information really and that's what I was

303
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,839
saying at the beginning of the show

304
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,040
people don't get better because the

305
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,760
right information's AR out there look I

306
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,240
know I I I'm saying I'm sorry for having

307
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,040
to say that because I sound like

308
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,959
probably you know uh I don't know I

309
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,240
sound sarcastic I sound like I I'm I

310
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,560
know it all but the truth is the truth

311
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,440
and and and I only have to you know I

312
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,800
only I only deal with the straight talk

313
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,720
that's all I can deal with I can't deal

314
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,800
with crap in between or Crap around it

315
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,240
has to be real and it has to be real

316
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,560
like real information that's the truth

317
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,200
how it works it can only go that way cuz

318
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,399
Spirit won't have it any other way I

319
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,320
can't play around if I move to if I

320
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,880
think another thing like oh what if it's

321
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,800
no what if it's this and yeah do an

322
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,639
antibiotic for that spirit will

323
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,160
literally set me straight set my butt

324
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,240
straight and say that's not how it works

325
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,279
that's not what's going on this is what

326
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,279
it is and so that's how I have the

327
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,199
information so what happens is when you

328
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,519
do an antibiotic when you're young then

329
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,120
you're going to more likely end up with

330
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,279
sibo because the antibiotics are going

331
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,040
to be upgrading the strep constantly

332
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,600
upgrading it and the antibiotics have

333
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,240
Petroleum in it they have eggs in it I

334
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,519
mean I mean for all for Pete's

335
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,800
sake and you know and now now I'm going

336
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,120
to talk about the antibiotics for a

337
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,959
little bit because I'm not against the

338
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,040
antibiotics on on the whole I'm not the

339
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,000
antibiotic Discovery was absolutely

340
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,160
phenomenal and it's amazing and we need

341
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,760
them it's just that we burned them out

342
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,639
we misused them we we developed more

343
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,440
strains of bacteria like SEI and other

344
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:12,519
types of bacteria because of

345
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,279
antibiotics and because of the overuse

346
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,279
for the wrong reasons because the

347
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,320
medical world Medical Research Medical

348
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,320
Science did not set up a system to teach

349
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,160
mommies how to take care of their kids

350
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,079
yet it doesn't exist so we have to rely

351
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,079
on naturopaths of course and good

352
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:31,480
functional medicine doctors and good

353
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:33,959
acupuncturist and good you know uh

354
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,800
homeopaths and we have to rely on them

355
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,199
to teach mommies how to start doing

356
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,519
things for their kids that are much more

357
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:41,920
natural and that's the only way out

358
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,000
that's the only way out of the strep

359
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,560
world because those kids the CH our

360
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,160
children are going to turn into adults

361
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,399
and deal with chronic strap like us

362
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,880
adults are and it really stinks and it's

363
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,560
getting worse than it was 15 years ago

364
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,519
cuz the strep has gotten stronger

365
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,440
there's 100 different strains of strep

366
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,360
and like I said before we're picking up

367
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,920
multiple strains by the time I've seen

368
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,160
But now by the time women are 38 I mean

369
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,880
they got five or six different strains

370
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,759
they got the vaginal strains where

371
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,399
they're getting tons of discharge where

372
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,440
doctors don't know what it is it's the

373
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,839
yeast or who knows or what and constant

374
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,120
antibiotics they're getting citis

375
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,480
they're getting um sinus infections on

376
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,680
top of cystitis I mean 38 years old 39

377
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,120
years old women at are 42 it it's no

378
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,199
joke and the suffering that comes along

379
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,560
with it is no joke and the discomfort

380
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,480
and everything else around it and so you

381
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,000
know it's all fun in games it's all fun

382
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,600
in games and and but we got we got to

383
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,279
take it serious and so the deal is is

384
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,440
this is you know we start out young we

385
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,519
go to the ENT the ENT doesn't realize

386
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,480
we're dealing with strep treating us

387
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,959
with antibiotics non-stop instead of

388
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,160
going natural roots we end up taking and

389
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,959
you know we're a child we take

390
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,600
antibiotics for every ear infections for

391
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,720
every throat for every sore throat for

392
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,560
every cough and that's the

393
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,480
start and then another child could be

394
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,839
doing the same thing then the child's in

395
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,800
school and then fluids are passed by

396
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,519
accident through drinking out of a cup

397
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,079
you got another strep being passed to

398
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,759
another child it's a different strep

399
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
it's an upgraded one now the child's

400
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,560
battling two different Fridays of strep

401
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,199
the child's sck sick again nobody knows

402
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,639
why it's an endless situation

403
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,560
and I'm not trying to paint a dark

404
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
picture I'm trying to paint a picture of

405
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,800
Hope because we can do something about

406
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,519
it we can be aware of it we can do

407
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,480
something about it we can do the right

408
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,959
things we're going to talk about things

409
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,759
you can do for your children regarding

410
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:46,920
strep so we can start things out that

411
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,480
way and for adults when you have strep

412
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,800
and you have chronic strep for a long

413
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,959
time so and a lot of times now in the in

414
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,440
the youth the younger ones are children

415
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,800
they get the they get the sibo now

416
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,319
earlier they're getting diagnosed with

417
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,560
small intestinal over overgrowth of

418
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:05,839
bacteria and um bacterial overgrowth and

419
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,480
that's from antibiotics feeding

420
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,240
strep and sometimes moms or dads have an

421
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,199
you know upgraded version meaning they

422
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,240
have an upgraded a more angrier version

423
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,880
of strep in their system it gets in the

424
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,360
child so the child has to start out with

425
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,880
an upgraded strep to begin with you see

426
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,399
so this is this is like this is serious

427
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:28,079
stuff and but if I don't tell you how it

428
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,319
works if I don't give you the deal on

429
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,600
how it works if I don't give you the

430
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:32,959
truth if I don't give you the right

431
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,880
information how are you going to know

432
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,560
what are we going to do just you know go

433
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,160
on another decade and another decade of

434
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,160
just whatever and until the new trend

435
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
comes out oh it's candida again let's go

436
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,000
to back to that

437
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,720
Trend all right so um so let's go into

438
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,959
this a little bit let's start when

439
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,959
you're younger you know um building up

440
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,920
the immune system in your child is is

441
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,800
critical when it comes down to strep so

442
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,399
you want the you want the zinc the zincs

443
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,759
I talk about

444
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,759
you want to have the b112 that's immune

445
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,199
system all immune system support vitamin

446
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,160
C Elderberry syrup um very important and

447
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,839
and when your child's getting something

448
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,919
of any kind you want to do golden seal

449
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,520
so you visit your naturopath talk about

450
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,760
what you can do get support um because

451
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,439
it's important to to nip strep in the

452
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,880
butt so it doesn't get out of control so

453
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:28,600
you're relying on antibiotics all the

454
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,919
time so that's number one now Okay so

455
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,720
what's going on with different

456
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,880
conditions when we get older let's talk

457
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,280
about that a little bit um so let's talk

458
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,000
about sibo for a minute sibo is an

459
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,000
overgrowth of strep because that's the

460
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,840
dominant strain um sibo is not an

461
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,720
overgrowth of SEI but sibo is an

462
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,440
overgrowth of strap so that's the

463
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,760
dominant strain in when we talk about

464
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,440
sibo now doctors don't know that yet so

465
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,480
practitioners don't know what it is they

466
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,960
don't know what sibo is sibo is really

467
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,679
just you know you got bacteria

468
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,120
we don't know what it is you can do a

469
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,240
breath test you can do a blood test you

470
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,120
can try to do different ways of

471
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,320
diagnosing sibo it's difficult um you

472
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,760
know it's usually takes a little

473
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,520
intuition too uh good practitioner and

474
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,039
but knowing what strain matters and

475
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,880
knowing the history of the person so if

476
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,320
someone has sibo chances are they had a

477
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,799
whole bunch of other things going on or

478
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,600
they get they get headaches they get

479
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,960
sinus headaches so they get other

480
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,880
problems or they got a weak immune

481
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,440
system because strep is so dominant in

482
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,200
such a Troublemaker so um and then you

483
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,799
know strep can go all through the colon

484
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,000
and cause IBS um irritable valow

485
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:42,520
syndrome and it can um even even

486
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,159
instigate uh other intestinal conditions

487
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,880
that are that have other problems like

488
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,480
for instance colitis is shingles

489
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,200
shingles in in the colon um so but when

490
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,320
you have a high level of strep and

491
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,559
you're inflamed from strep too it makes

492
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,000
the colitis worse so strep is this

493
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,720
friend we don't want around because if

494
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,600
we have something else wrong with us

495
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,760
it's the biggest pain in the butt um

496
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,559
because it's hanging around so if you're

497
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,960
someone with a with a condition of any

498
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,280
kind the last thing you need is chronic

499
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,000
UTI now along with your chronic

500
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,960
condition now if you're a woman and

501
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,679
you're having you know um you know and

502
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,840
everything come happens when you're

503
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:24,080
having your period or having your your

504
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,799
cycle um when you're menstruating what

505
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,559
happens is that if you have strep in the

506
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,360
sinuses you're going to get your

507
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,320
problems more when you're having your

508
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,640
cycle if you have acne because you have

509
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,960
stre chronic strep causing acne you're

510
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,880
going to it's going to come on around

511
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,159
the cycle or around when the hormones

512
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,080
are shifting and the body's doing

513
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,840
something strange when you're ovulating

514
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,840
so you're having stress on the body

515
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,520
because of that and then they going to

516
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,760
get more acne somewhere around these

517
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,400
different time periods if you have

518
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,720
anything like uh cystitis it's going to

519
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,400
come more when you're um having your

520
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,840
cycle it's going to come on more

521
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,400
problematic

522
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,480
um you know could be anything UTI can

523
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,080
come on more when your Cycle's coming on

524
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,240
um let's see uh if you have

525
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,880
endometriosis and uh you have your cycle

526
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,679
it's going to be more problematic

527
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,360
especially if you have strep in your

528
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,080
system if you have pelvic inflammatory

529
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,640
disease which is basically anything in

530
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,440
any kind of inflammation in the

531
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:25,840
reproductive system whatsoever as a

532
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:29,880
woman that's all strep Mo 90% of pelvic

533
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,840
inflammatory problems are streps and so

534
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,080
that's going to happen when you're

535
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,039
having your cycle it's going to happen a

536
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,320
little bit more you're going to be a

537
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,720
little bit more flamed a little bit more

538
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,400
problematic so that's how it works

539
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,559
giving you the window into how strep

540
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,520
works and what it is it's really

541
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,039
critical now the reason why acne takes

542
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,600
so long to heal for people so many

543
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,760
people is because it's antibiotic fed

544
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,480
strep it's an upgraded variety of strep

545
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,200
and many of the people have bad acne and

546
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,320
um and there's nothing scary about any

547
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,159
of this this we're talking about we're

548
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,280
moving past it to clear it up and clean

549
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,720
things up and heal now I know I haven't

550
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,880
done an acne show per se I've done a UTI

551
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,159
show I talked about strep in the UTI

552
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,080
that whole thing if you want to look

553
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,760
back at that other show in the past but

554
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,840
acne doesn't go away right away it come

555
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,520
it es and flows because the strep Fights

556
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,200
Back constantly but building up the

557
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,480
immune system and cleaning up the diet

558
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,159
longer term gets rid of acne for good

559
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,279
I've seen people freed up from it who

560
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,320
have devastating cases for 10 15 years

561
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,640
in their life 20 years in their life and

562
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,360
I've seen it go away when we're diligent

563
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,600
and we're strong about it we're going to

564
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,679
talk about different foods and different

565
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,320
supplements too um that's going to help

566
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,240
all of this it's going to help acne it's

567
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,840
going to help the UTI it's going to help

568
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,240
the cystitis cystitis is scar tissue in

569
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,159
the bladder from strep so cystis is

570
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,400
actually scar tissue in the bladder

571
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,520
lining on the bladder lining it's like a

572
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,799
rash on the bladder lining but but if

573
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,360
kind of like scarred up tissue and

574
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,679
that's from strep being in the bladder

575
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,720
so long

576
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,720
and you know it's from um it's from old

577
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,200
UTI and sometimes you didn't have you

578
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,279
don't even have to have a UTI you could

579
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,760
just have it in the bladder and it's

580
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:10,159
sitting there you know and and and

581
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,120
causing trouble and it doesn't feel like

582
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,679
you have a real bad UTI once in a while

583
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,039
or whatever or you just feel like you

584
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,159
got little problems going on but that's

585
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:22,039
that's strep and that's what cystitis is

586
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:24,559
um once that rash in there gets U that

587
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:26,039
scar tissue gets kind of um inflamed and

588
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,640
the blood vessels get inflamed and

589
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,720
things are swelling up um then you know

590
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,000
it gets sensitive to any kind of food it

591
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,880
gets sensitive to how you how much uric

592
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,960
acid you have what's the acid profile

593
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,000
you have in your um urine um you name it

594
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,480
it just can get it es and flows in so

595
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,640
many ways but

596
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,080
stopping the strap is the key so I'm

597
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,880

598
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,600

ways of just getting out of all this

601
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,880
going to talk about diet foods and

602
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,400

csstis I think I said it already UTI

611
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,120
we're trying to get out of all this this

612
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:31,320
is all strep fun fun fun fun with strep

613
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,840
that's all this is and and so uh and you

614
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,679
oh I forgot

615
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,080
sty um that's another one too good old

616
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,240
sty many of them are strep related not

617
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,039
all of them some of them are viral we

618
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,279
can get a we can get a virus in the eye

619
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,480
and cause a sty that does happen but

620
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,240
it's a different kind of sty not all sty

621
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,880
look the same not all sty are the same

622
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,679
and who's keeping tabs on all this by

623
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,240
the way where's medical research and

624
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,080
medical science you once again I think

625
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,080
about sometimes when someone approaches

626
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,919
me every now and then they get upset and

627
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,559
they say what do you know about Med

628
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,919
medical research and medical science you

629
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,559
and I'm like you tell me what do you

630
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,520
know does medical re science medical

631
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,799
science and research have tabs on all

632
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,240
the different varieties of sty and which

633
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,720
ones are bacterial and which ones are

634
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,159
viral no I mean what could go on and on

635
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,880
and on and on I mean seriously you guys

636
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,000
for real I me I could go on with that

637
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,480
one I mean you tell me what about the

638
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,120
mommy that can't take care of her kids

639
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,360
cuz she sick with strap and she's got

640
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,039
epsteen bar and no one can help her and

641
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,200
she's got the worst fibromyalgia ever

642
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,279
and all they could do is offer a

643
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,240
medication and tell her she's crazy you

644
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:40,240
tell me ask her where medical research

645
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,919
and medical science has left her and so

646
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,080
this is no joke here you know I take

647
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,559
people's Health serious so when someone

648
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,279
ever wants to challenge me a little bit

649
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,279
and say you know oh you don't you know

650
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,679
you don't have you don't have 10 years

651
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,159
in medical school what do you know and

652
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,799
you know it's it's you know what that's

653
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,320
basically disregarding when someone says

654
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,120
that they're disregarding someone's pain

655
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,240
and suffering they're disregarding what

656
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,000
someone's been through they're

657
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,559
disregarding how someone's been to 50

658
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,360
doctors looking for help and can't find

659
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,399
any help for their strep issues that

660
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,919
they're undiagnosed strep strep issues

661
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:15,559
so you know that's completely being

662
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,880
disrespectful for the people who have

663
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,799
suffered the people who have gone

664
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,919
through Howen back the people who lay in

665
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,840
bed dying of chronic illness and

666
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,640
so-called autoimmune meaning it's it's a

667
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,520
real Illness but they're diagnosed with

668
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,880
autoimmune and telling their telling

669
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,279
them their bodies are attacking the M

670
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,200
themselves so they die faster you name

671
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,760
it it's completely disrespectful when

672
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,760
someone says where's your 10 years of

673
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,520
medical school what do you know yet you

674
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,480
know what what do you know so and I say

675
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,080
this with passion and caring because

676
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,679
I've watched I get choked up emotionally

677
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,720
my heart gets a little funny and I get

678
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,320
choked up because I I've seen it all out

679
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,640
there I know what you guys have gone

680
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,520
through I know some of you have gone

681
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,159
through this I know that okay and my job

682
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,760
is to be on what you know watching your

683
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,440
back my job is be on your side okay so

684
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,840
I'm going to come across like this every

685
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,360
now and then so if new new uh listeners

686
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,480
logged in and they see I'm slightly

687
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,840
sarcastic or a little bit harsh on you

688
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,960
know what we've been through with the

689
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,480
medical systems and everything both both

690
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,559
alternative and conventional just hang

691
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:20,000
in there for the ride it's because you

692
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:21,440
know I I feel the pain of of everybody

693
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,399
who what they've gone through and I've

694
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,399
seen it forever since I've been here um

695
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:29,600
so here's the deal it's about building

696
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,200
up the immune system and battling strep

697
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,240
and cleaning it up it's about knowing

698
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,600
what we're going after you know if you

699
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,159
don't know what you're going after you

700
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,840
can't get better if we think acne is

701
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:47,320
just a hormonal pimple cystic acne is

702
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,559
just a hormonal pimple we're not getting

703
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,640
it better if we don't know what it

704
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:58,120
is if we think our sinus

705
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:01,159
infection you know is from uh pollen in

706
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,600
the air then we don't know we're not

707
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,520
going to be getting it

708
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:09,919
better you know if we think our cytis is

709
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:12,279
just because we're getting older then

710
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,240
how are we going to get better and if we

711
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,880
think you know all if we think our

712
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,279
vaginal discharge is just yeast how are

713
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,480
we going to get better so we get rid of

714
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,480
those yeast infections that are really

715
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,640
strep and not yeast how are we going to

716
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,840
get better if we don't know what's going

717
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,080
on how do you get better that's the

718
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,720
whole point and that's where we're

719
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,760

782
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,399
strepa cacus the

783
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,640
bacteria eggs right we need to avoid

784
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,240
that I see people diagnosed with sibo

785
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,840
and they're told only to eat

786
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,600
eggs eggs bacon and then a few

787
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,360
vegetables and then maybe a a small

788
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,480
handful of like a

789
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,360
berry one Berry like a tiny little

790
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,519
handful of raspberries like once every 4

791
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:23,039
days and they have to be eating you know

792
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:25,480
four eggs a day some natural bacon and

793
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,440
um and then they can they can eat a few

794
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,399
vegetables and that's not how sibo works

795
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,840
that's not how it works that's not what

796
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,559
what goes on eggs feed sibo they feed

797
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,000
strepa cacus strepa cacus was raised on

798
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:44,159
egg by the way it was raised in

799
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,600
Labs by eggs you think strep just

800
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,559
appeared it's in our life now because

801
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,399
it's been

802
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:55,760
raised uh it escaped in the world it was

803
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,720
Bread on eggs just telling you right

804
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,399
now so you got sinus infections you got

805
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,679
cystitis that's the other thing if

806
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,840
you're a woman and you have cystitis or

807
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,440
a man with

808
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,080
cystitis and um you go to the doctor

809
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,760
you're told to eat

810
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,440
eggs that's that's you know so you feed

811
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,840
the bacteria and cause more citis even

812
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,720
if the egg you don't feel it when you

813
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,919
eat the egg like you don't feel it

814
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,600
irritate your scar tissue and your

815
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,559
bladder you're still you know you're it

816
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,440
it's still feeding the problem and you

817
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,360
know we're told you know we're told to

818
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,919
do this and I know this is off the topic

819
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,200
a little bit like

820
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,639
PCOS um women are told to eat lots of

821
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,559
eggs at PCOS worst thing we could ever

822
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:40,919
do eggs make the cysts they make the

823
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,840
tumors they literally are the tumor and

824
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,360
cyst grower of all time eggs feed breast

825
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,000
cancer cysts

826
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:53,320
calcifications nodules tumors on the on

827
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,440
the thyroid eggs feed all this uh do I

828
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,799
have anything against eggs no they taste

829
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,080
amazing and uh and and they're delicious

830
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,760
and you can make scrambled eggs taste

831
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,399
really good you can make an omelette and

832
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,000
make people happy and you can cook the

833
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,480
best eggs in the world and people love

834
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,440
it and I get it got nothing against them

835
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,080
but if you got something going on you're

836
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,919
worried about cysts and you're worried

837
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,519
about PCOS and you're worried about you

838
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,720
know cystitis and you're worried about

839
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,639
um you know cancer because it's in your

840
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,480
family or whatever it is then eggs is

841
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,399
gone so you want the eggs to be gone be

842
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:32,480
gone and um so the deal is is another

843
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:37,000
one is dairy products strep ferociously

844
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,399
feeds off of cheese milk butter ghee

845
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
ghee I know there's a big ghee movement

846
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:43,159
on there I'm not against the ghee

847
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,159
movement but if you got any of these

848
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:46,919
symptoms and you got strap of any kind

849
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:49,840
and you got what I'm talking

850
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,320
about then you don't want ghee in there

851
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,039
either you don't even want remotely the

852
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,679
hint of what would have been a dairy

853
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,679
product you just don't want it there

854
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,639
okay so that's important and I don't

855
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,159
care if it's a belief system if it's a

856
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:05,279
belief system somewhere I I don't have a

857
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,519
belief system I know I've told you guy

858
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,080
this the guys this before but I don't

859
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,159
have a belief system if I adopt a belief

860
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,960
system then I'm going to totally mess

861
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,480
you guys up instantly if I adopt one

862
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,799
belief system I'm going to mess you guys

863
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,799
up because you're going to be cheated

864
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:25,159
out of healing I just have to do what's

865
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,399
right that's all I just have to do

866
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:30,200
what's right so you can heal so you keep

867
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:33,440
the dairy products out milk cheese

868
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:37,039
butter ghee whatever it is you just keep

869
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:40,080
it out so that's important to know um

870
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:43,760
corn corn is such an instigator with

871
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,240
strep strep is a corn eater corn

872
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,559
feeder so um keep the corn out wheat

873
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,480
wheat gluten

874
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:55,159
Rye

875
00:33:50,480 --> 00:34:00,840
Rye um that's another one so barley

876
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:03,240
wheat Rye not barley grass barley grass

877
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,000
juice is an

878
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,440
anti-

879
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:14,679
strep wheat grass juice is

880
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:17,720
antip wheat isn't barley isn't but the

881
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,480
juice of the grass is anti-strep because

882
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,119
it changed its structure to actually

883
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,440
have a phytochemical toward W off strap

884
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,480
very important to understand um so these

885
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,079
are some of the foods to avoid canola

886
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,119
oil is the ultimate ultimate ultimate

887
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,879
mistake for cystitis for strep for you

888
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:40,200
know anything going on bacterial vagino

889
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:42,599
bacterial vaginosis is strepa cacus by

890
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,079
the way um you know immune system

891
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,480
problems you name it intestinal

892
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:51,399
disorders Crohn's IBS anything you don't

893
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:54,159
want to go near canol the oil and I said

894
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:55,639
this on a previous show just recently

895
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,000
but there's just you know there's new

896
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,680
new people on the scene and new guys on

897
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,880
the scene that that are deemed

898
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,760
themselves experts and they got new

899
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,560
literature out that they've created and

900

961
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,880
to say trying to get the words out even

962
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,280
if it's not organic time you can't find

963
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,800
organic time I'm totally fine it this is

964
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,359
what we need right here we need the

965
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,920
oregano we need the thyme we need the

966
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,079
Rosemary aromatic herbs the sage and

967
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,560
this is a Powerhouse towards knocking

968
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:02,800
down strep in the system now strep

969
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,920
doesn't go away right away it doesn't go

970
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,599
away right away you have to have

971
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,760
patience you have to have time and

972
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,000
patience because it's been there in most

973
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,760
of us for decades most of our lives and

974
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,599
it and it tends to creep up it tends to

975
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,800
get worse throughout our life causing

976
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,599
all kinds of problems causing headaches

977
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,200
causing fatigue causing a little bit of

978
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:27,160
fatigue causing um confusion causing um

979
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,119
fevers lowgrade fevers

980
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:33,400
causing all these different

981
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,319
things and it sits in a long term es and

982
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,119
flows with where immune system is and

983
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:39,280
where we are in our

984
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,119
lives and so it's going to take a little

985
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,839
time you got to incorporate these things

986
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,960
without a doubt in the um life-changing

987
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,079
Foods book I really laid it out in there

988
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,560
so if you gather all the foods in there

989
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,720
that help with the with the strep like

990
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,119
the aromatic herbs you can see what it

991
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,200
does for it so we got the Rosemary we

992
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:00,000
got the sage got the or you know oregano

993
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,560
we got the time garlic it's another one

994
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,400
someone told me the other day they said

995
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,400
you know I follow this other belief

996
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,240
system where Garlic's too hot of a food

997
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,560

it you name it onions are amazing for

1026
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,440
knocking down strep but you might say

1027
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,800
hey Anthony I've eaten an onion and my

1028
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:30,040
strep ain't better no no no no no no no

1029
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:32,119
no you might have also had an egg a week

1030
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,760
before you might and I'm not trying to

1031
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:35,280
be mean you can still eat other things

1032
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,200
in your life you can still have a piece

1033
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,280
of fish you can still have if you love

1034
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,920
turkey you can still have a little

1035
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,359
turkey if you want some free range

1036
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,880
chicken you probably could have some of

1037
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,319
that if you're into that you could

1038
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,960
probably have a little bit of grass-fed

1039
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,440
beef if you're really into that but if

1040
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,480
you have an egg your streps not going

1041
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,000
away it's just

1042
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,200
not you know so it's really important to

1043
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,319
know um and if you're you know if you're

1044
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,240
plant-based it's even more helpful for

1045
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:02,960
strep when you're plant-based it

1046
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,480
definitely is more helpful not saying

1047
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,880
you know everybody has to go plant-based

1048
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,319
but if you're dealing with bad strep

1049
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,560
sinusitis and all these other things you

1050
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:11,240
might want to consider a 28-day cleanse

1051
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,880
to start you off like I talk about in

1052
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,160
the first medical medium book you know

1053
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,160
that you guys know about the medical

1054
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,160
medium book and um you can do you know

1055
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,079
modified 28-day cleanse you can bring in

1056
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,560
other foods you can bring in more if you

1057
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,920
want um but there's ways of at least

1058
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,920
doing a little plant-based for a little

1059
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,400
while life and get a jump on the strep

1060
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,880
and then when you bring back animal

1061
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,280
proteins or fish or whatever you want to

1062
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,640
bring in you keep the eggs out and the

1063
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,000
dairy products out and the other things

1064
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,200
I'm talking

1065
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
about but it takes more than an onion

1066
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,400
once in a while you you got to have

1067
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,720
onion in your food every day and you're

1068
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,319
going to start knocking down strap but

1069
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,880
you got have to have onion in your food

1070
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,160
every day that's okay that's that's

1071
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,240
possible chop up in a red onion put a

1072
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,240
slice on your salad once a day it

1073
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,079
matters you know if you can get it every

1074
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,920
other day it matters turmeric is a great

1075
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:06,680
anti-er that's a great one anti-strep

1076
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,359
totally knocks down that strep so

1077
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,160
turmeric's a good one there's turmeric

1078
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,480

have a strep that's in there might be in

1104
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,400
there for a long time could be an

1105
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,359
upgraded version could be more of a

1106
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,040
bacterial you know resistant uh version

1107
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:11,440

1108
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,079
might have to do a few more things with

1109
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,200
it all and take out some of the foods

1110
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,440
we're talking about but we can do this

1111
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,280
and if you're not ready to do it now if

1112
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,760
you're not ready to do anything for it

1113
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,359

do it I have people that won't do

1117
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,200
anything and I stand behind them because

1118
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,440
that's where they are in the moment of

1119
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,720
their life well I I stand behind them

1120
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,599
with total respect because they're just

1121
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,440
they're not there in that moment to to

1122
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:45,480
to want to do a lot for their health and

1123
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,319

1124
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,200

1125
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,880

1128
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,359
you to not do it

1129
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,520
okay I know it sounds funny but I'm

1130
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:06,520
serious because I also know you're

1131
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,839
learning that person's learning that

1132
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,079
person's listening I got people to

1133
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,480
listen to the show you guys there's

1134
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,599
people out there like some of you are

do some of the things I want you to do

1137
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,920
but that doesn't matter to me because

1138
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,440
you're learning and you're becoming a

1139
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,680
health expert and then you turn around

1140
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,040
and don't even realize it and you tell

1141
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,800

that and and it's powerful man it's

1144
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:33,160
powerful so so like I said I'm we're all

all

1257
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,559
kinds so these are the things to focus

1258
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,200
on you know just and look a little bit

1259
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:07,079
goes a long way you get a little bit of

1260
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,720
cats claw in you every day you get your

1261
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:13,319
zinc levels up to par every day you get

1262
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,319
your vitamin C in you every day but wait

1263
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:18,240
a minute you're doing oregano time

1264
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:21,440
rosemary sage somehow meaning some

1265
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,160
oregano capsules little time tea you got

1266
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,920
some Sage chopped up in your food and

1267
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,880
you're moving forward you see that you

1268
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,920
got banana smoothie with wild

1269
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,880
blueberries in the morning that's

1270
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:37,760
amazing and it goes on and it goes on

1271
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:40,839
but it builds over time and you can be

1272
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,119
freed you can be freed and you can

1273
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:45,520
protect your

1274
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:47,400
children and protect their children you

1275
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,119
get the zinc up to par in your children

1276
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,359
you get a little bit of Elderberry syrup

1277
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:56,040
in them you get some vitamin C in them

1278
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:58,559
and we can minimize the antibiotics

1279
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,280
but the antibiotics are this catch22

1280
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,000
it's like you get a bad UTI that's so

1281
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,760
out of control because you've eaten all

1282
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,319
these different wrong things and your

1283
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,319
strep is out of control causing the

1284
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:09,839
worst UTI ever and your immune system's

1285
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:11,599
dropped because you don't have zinc and

1286
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,760
then you have to take an antibiotic and

1287
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,319
it suppresses it and it pushes the strep

1288
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,680
down but then the strep comes back and

1289
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:19,599
two months later with another raging UTI

1290
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,799
we have to build all this up so we don't

1291
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,880
have to rely on the antibiotics

1292
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:26,720
eventually so we're coming to the end of

1293
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,079
