right bladder issues that are

77
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,400
unexplainable that just get a diagnosis

78
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,000
that really doesn't help

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,319
all these things people have gone

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,640

82
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,599
and good to see you guys and so i was

83
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,519
known as this bizarre symptoms guy and

84
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,400
one of the tools

85
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,720
powerful tools for spirit of compassion

86
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,560
was

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,920
juicing a minimum of 16 ounces of celery

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,959
right on an empty stomach on an empty

89
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,640
stomach

90
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,159
okay and you know once a day

91
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,159

like a whole another level

94
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,920
and so look if you're not juicing celery

right meaning you might be straining it

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,800
or you might

184
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,240
not be straining it which one is because

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
but you still have to strain it through

189
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,240
a fine mesh strainer

190
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,800
right so that's one thing

191
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,360
because the little the little the little

192
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,479
tiny

193
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,639
the pulp left over can be a

194
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,520
like sometimes promote that kind of

195
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,240
peristaltic

196
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,800
action it's one thing the other thing is

197
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,400
if

198
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
cell like for okay here's the other

199
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,639
thing be your own detective

200
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,919
so that means there's nothing else

201
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,599
that's giving you diarrhea

202
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,120
like you have never never had diarrhea

203
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,560
before

204
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,520
just a question right so i ask everybody

205
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,560
that okay

206
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,840
if celery juice gives you diarrhea just

207
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,080
a little bit of it

208
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,919
is your stomach upset on a normal basis

209
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,720
so everything's perfect your stomach's

210
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,000
fine

211
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,639
nothing's ever happened with your

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,840
stomach like nothing goes wrong with it

213
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,000
you don't have bloating you know

214
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,880
cramping diarrhea no stomach digestive

215
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,440
issues whatsoever

216
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,039
everything's completely perfect until

217
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,440
you have a little celery juice

218
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,120
and then diarrhea comes or did you have

219
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,800
diarrhea last week

220
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,720
um did you have diarrhea three days ago

221
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,160
did you have diarrhea two months ago a

222
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
week ago two weeks ago

223
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,440
or do you have a little bit of it on and

224
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,440
off every other day

225
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,280
and it's hit or miss it's like whoa got

226
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,199
the runs now i don't know what i ate

227
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,039

like

230
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,800
so be your own detective that's one

231
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,800
thing there so

232
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
then you can distinguish how you know

233
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,879
you got the tummy

234
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,520
the tummy stuff going on right you know

235
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,280
or

236
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,960
is everything perfect and you drink a

237
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,639
little celery juice because if

238
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
everything's perfect

239
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,479
and you drink a little celery juice

240
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,400
right that celery juice

241
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,599
is doing some cleansing so it's killing

242
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,759
off some bugs

243
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,360
if everything's not perfect and you have

244
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,560
stomach problems anyway

245
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,360
and stomach issues anyway it's killing

246
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,720
off some bugs too right so we'll go into

247
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,960
that a little bit here's a close here's

248
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,400
a sodium cluster salt right here

249
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,919
it's an orange it's an orange eva lopez

250
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,960
i've been drinking celery juice for the

251
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,080
last four months

252
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,080
every morning went

253
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,440
went and had a wellness check it came

254
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
back with no issues

255
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,959
my doctor was amazed because i'm 49

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
years old

257
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,120
and i'm not on any pharmaceutical the

258
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,560
doctor said keep drinking

259
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,880
that celery juice amazing and you know

260
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,680
look you guys got to look out to you for

261
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,640
triggers i

262
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,240
call them new medical treatments you

263
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,959
gotta always question them

264
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,800
look out for triggers be careful because

265
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,959
you could have some good health and then

266
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,080
a new medical treatment could set some

267
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,839
people back

268
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,519
if they're not checking into stuff you

269
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,320
know what i mean kind of give you kind

270
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,440
of heads up

271
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,040
and then not only that um

272
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
other triggers like are you going to

273
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
your doctor and getting blood tests

274
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,680
regularly

275
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,240
and are they drawing a lot of blood they

276
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,320
drawing 70 milliliters 50 milliliters

277
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
100 milliliters 140 milliliters 200 ml

278
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,600
are they taking blood because then you

279
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,839
lose your immune system and eventually

280
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
you go backwards that way too keep in

281
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,839
mind that there's always a couple of

282
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,279
triggers

283
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
that we have to keep you know always

284
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,600
look out for because yeah

285
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,519
the celery juice can help us help us

286
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,519
help us and then we do things

287
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,560
then knock us down knock us down knock

288
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,200
us down

289
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,880
right that's how it works you're going

290
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,720
up you're going up with your celery

291
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,720
i'm getting better whoa moving the

292
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
needle moving the needle this is great

293
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,920
moving the needle this is amazing i'm

294
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,839
going to put these celery sticks in here

295
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,360
moving the needle drinking my celery

296
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,279
juice getting better

297
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,720
and what just had a whole bunch of blood

298
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,920
taken for me just had a whole bunch of

299
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,080
blood taken from me

300
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,519
said going backwards don't know why

301
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,480
maybe it's the celery just no

302
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,160
it's the blood taken out right or you're

303
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,519
moving forward you're moving up

304
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,040
you're drinking your celery juice you're

305
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,079
moving the needle you're moving the

306
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,880
needle

307
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,240
and then boom new medical treatment that

308
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
was offered or something

309
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,160
something you didn't do enough research

310
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,680
on something you know that

311
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,640
maybe you got peer pressured into

312
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,760
right something you might have been peer

313
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,040
pressured into

314
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,040
right and boom back going back

315
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,640
going back going back going back you

316
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,480
know and

317
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
so i mean keep that in mind too i forgot

318
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,519
to do my blood extraction you guys

319
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,200
i got some bio nature tomato paste let

320
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,120
me use that this time

321
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
um by the way we're live on youtube

322
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,560
we're live on facebook

323
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,920
so i got some bio nature tomato paste

324
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,040
which actually is really good

325
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,720
tomato base is clean it's it's really

326
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:54,000
good stuff all right and i got my little

327
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,079
needle here so so let's see

328
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,480
here this is such a big syringe i can't

329
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,800
get it in here

330
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,600
so i might have to get a smaller syringe

331
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,040
we're live

332
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,000
i don't know what i'm saying if anything

333
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,680
can go wrong

334
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,640
it will right um

335
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,959
i'll go look for another syringe but so

336
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,600
we

337
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,079
we do these things that we don't realize

338
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
right

339
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,760
that could set us back when we move the

340
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
needle

341
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,959
and we're moving the needle forward and

342
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,160
then there's this war

343
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,839
right this war that's happening

344
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,880
this war of you're doing something good

345
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,880
and then you're getting hit backwards

346
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,959
with something that you don't know might

347
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,480
not be so good like i always tell

348
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,040
people yeah i want people to go to their

349
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,079
doctor absolutely okay i talk to doctors

350
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,160
all the time

351
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,240
and i want people to see their doctors i

352
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,079
want people to get blood tested

353
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,320
i want people to take advice

354
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,480
recommendations prescriptions from their

355
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
doctors right

356
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,160
but at the same time doctors are in this

357
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,760
playing field where they don't know

358
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,200
what's wrong with people right they

359
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
don't know what causes chronic illness a

360
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
doctor

361
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,200
doesn't know what causes fibromyalgia

362
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,040
doesn't know what causes ra

363
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
they don't know what causes lyme disease

364
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
because they were wrong about the

365
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,519
bacteria

366
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,680
so when when they don't know what's

367
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,600
going on with people but they also

368
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,800
here's how it works with big pharma and

369
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
doctors i'm going to give you this

370
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,680
little tidbit right here and this is

371
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,880
really important to know right

372
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,399
is big pharma puts pressure on doctors

373
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,079
because i talk to doctors all the time

374
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,480
been talking to doctors forever about

375
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,240
this stuff right and big pharma

376
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,560

the experiment

459
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,199

460
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,320
i got an appointment of doctors

461
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,399

a prescription for this drug

472
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,519
he was only told just recently

473
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,600
by a representative of a big pharma to

474
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,480
try these drugs so now you become the

475
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,480
experiment

476
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
you're the experiment now right doesn't

477
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,440
this make celery juice so much nicer

478
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,240
when i think about it

479
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
does this make celery juice like what

480
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,440
you know

481
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,560
you can take celery juice and work on

482
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,320
getting better

483
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,839
millions are healing around the world i

484
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,519
mean doesn't this other process sound

485
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,079
horrifying in a way

486
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,680
so we become an experiment to every

487
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,839
single drug that comes out

488
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,959
so every single drug the big pharma

489
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,600
peddles

490
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,000
that had they have their drug dealers

491
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,560
right

492
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,839
bring their black bag to all the clinics

493
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,519
if you just got on here i'm talking

494
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,880
about big pharma's drug dealers they go

495
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,320
to all the clinics and all the doctors

496
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,120
in all the hospitals and all doctors

497
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
offices

498
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,079
and they take their black bag out and

499
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,440
they show the doctors the new drugs

500
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,560
coming out and then you become the

501
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,240
experiment

502
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,600
and if that drug's been out already for

503
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,040
two months you're now part of the

504
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,160
experiment for two months if the drug's

505
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
been out for two years probably

506
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,600
experiment for two years

507
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,720
christine k did the doctors make money

508
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,880
off each prescription

509
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,800
yes i talked to one doctor and every

510
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,360
single prescription that the doctor

511
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,800
prescribes he gets five dollars

512
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,839
um off that prescription

513
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,399
for a lifetime like a stipend kind of

514
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,759
thing

515
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,839
now i don't know of all doctors they

516
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,279
don't know all around the world

517
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,639
i talked to a lot of doctors i talked to

518
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,600
one doctor and he says he gets five

519
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,560
dollars

520
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:03,120
for every single bottle or prescription

521
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,319
that's sold so that means that then this

522
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,000
doctor told me it's going to give him a

523
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,199
lifetime of playing golf right

524
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,959
so you're going to be able to play golf

525
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,319
not every doctor is signed on to this

526
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
program i don't think i don't know how

527
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,760
it works really i mean i should find out

528
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,679
bet more about it but he told me that

529
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,679
it's like okay well

530
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,280
so now you know that means he said when

531
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,199
he retires

532
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,120
if people are still using those

533
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,400
prescriptions because they're sick for

534
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,679
their whole lifetime and he's still

535
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,199
getting five dollars for every bottle

536
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,640
that's filled right

537
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,160
but that was him i don't know if it's

538
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,840
like that for but he said don't don't

539
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,840
don't quote me on that for everybody

540
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,360
every doctor every country

541
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,760
this country that country don't quote me

542
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,080
on that but i did hear that um

543
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,679
and i'm gonna look into it more too but

544
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,039
the bottom line is

545
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,160
the bottom line is we become an

546
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,840
experiment right so the drug dealer from

547
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,720
big pharma ashley kevin i saw

548
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,559
the drug dealer from big pharma comes to

549
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,880
the doctor's office

550
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,240
shows him what he's got whether it's

551
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,080
five years ago four years ago three

552
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,320
years ago today tomorrow

553
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080

554
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,960
on that drug right

555
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,120
so everybody your experiment right so

556
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,919
with that in mind

557
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,240
right there could be some new medical

558
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:16,640
treatments that are really really

559
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,960
peer pressure peer pressure

560
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
you know

561
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,280
[Music]

562
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,679

563
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,160
under pressure

564

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,600
and trouble spots out there and

576
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,880

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,000
um so i just want you to know

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,440
that we have to we have to be

people out there say i don't know about

584
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,960
celery juice

585
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,440
i don't know about it i don't trust it i

586
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
don't

587
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,799

588
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,799
keep on taking all my drugs

589
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,480

i just so the bottom line is you guys is

602
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,120
when we're healing

603
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,080
there's there's ways we can go backwards

604
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,039
and we have to be careful we have to

605
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,280
look out right

606
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,200
the blood draw is one of them that's one

607
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,320
right there all on its own

608
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,320
um there's a lot of reasons

609
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,520
that we have to be careful not just one

610
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,720
right there

611
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,280
i'm not talking about getting your

612
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,640
carpets cleaned right there that can

613
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,600
set somebody back can't tell you how

614
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,919
many people they get their carpets

615
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,240
cleaned by toxic chemicals boom

616
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,039
uh household cleaners that aren't

617
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,320
natural

618
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,559
boom right msg and natural flavors uh

619
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,919
bug bites bug bites can set people back

620
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,039
i've seen bug bites set

621
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,360
people back right so you know they're

622
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,080
it's swimming in the ocean as beautiful

623
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,960
as it seems did

624
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,039
everything cold white spring um hearing

625
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,000
about odd reactions from people living

626
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,240
with those that

627
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,960
had certain things going on huh out

628
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,200
there so yeah i mean the bottom line is

629
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,559
you know it's it's there's a lot of

630
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,679
things happening

631
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,960
that we get stuck in right so we get a

632
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,559
lot of radiation

633
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,159
you go through the airport that's a big

634
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,600
one i can't even tell you right

635
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,640
like i tell family and friends like

636
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,320
hey be careful in the airport you know

637
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,200
be careful opt

638
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,799
out for certain things and stuff because

639
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,960
you go into the airport

640
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,760
and the radiation you can get whacked

641
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,520
with when you're traveling is

642
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,919
unbelievable right and then your luggage

643
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
too

644
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,880
i tell people you gotta throw out your

645
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,480
luggage every now and then you got to

646
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
throw your luggage out

647
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,159
keep that in mind you know it's it's

648
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,320
like because

649
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,520
the luggage is a radiation collector

650
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,720
right when you go through the airport

651
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,720
you got a knapsack

652
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,720
what i do is i throw that knapsack out

653
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,280
every time yeah it gets expensive and

654
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,320
it's annoying but i try to balance my

655
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,640
own personal life budget to that

656
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,360
you know so when i travel and i have to

657
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,799
stick that

658
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:49,039
that knapsack that on through that

659
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,039
radiation little spot right there right

660
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,720
if i do that i know that that thing's

661
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,240
gonna collect so much radiation

662
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,400
that if i have it in my house or

663
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,760
whatever it is or wherever i am and i

664
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,919
have it it's going to constantly be

665
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,600
radiating that radiation right so

666
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,520
it's these things that matter all these

667
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,799
little things add up so what can we do

668
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,960
for ourselves celery juice is one of

669
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,159
those things that can also help us

670
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,760
um yeah susan gross is a harmful

671
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,679
fly choice of years twice a year isn't

672
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,280
bad but just look out for those very

673
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,919
things right

674
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,159
so um here's the thing about celery

675
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,559
juice if you're gonna buy celery juice

676
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:27,360
don't do hpp don't buy it with

677
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,120
hpp that is a bad

678
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,880
trick going down right now and i know

679
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,039

that's another one right there high

684
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,480
pressure pasteurization

685
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,600
right and you know high pressure

686
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,640
pasteurization just

687
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,559
isn't gonna work uh cat conte celery

688
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,640
juice daily for six months i am healing

689
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,000

book you guys i didn't even show you my

692
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,280
book right

693
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,159
revise and expand it new edition the

694
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,679
medical medium

695
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,200
new edition it's gotta be the new

696
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,919
edition definitely

697
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,559
definitely gonna be a new edition right

698
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,799
so

699
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,880
hpp is something that's a new uh

700
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,559
pasteurization process that's fairly new

701
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,840
in the last decade right

702
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,320
and it allows juices

703
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,360
on the store shelf to look like they're

704
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,600
raw

705
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,799
and to look like they're fresh just

706
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,919
letting you know

707
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:30,240
so and and they don't use heat

708
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,320
to pasteurize so they're allowed to say

709
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,760
hey this stuff is fresh this stuff is

710
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,440
raw right

711
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,200
and it's got a shelf life on there for a

712
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,159
month or to have a shelf life on there

713
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,240
for three

714
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,159
three weeks or a shelf life on there for

715
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,840
you know two weeks you'll see it right

716
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,960
but if it was really fresh juice

717
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,640
it only has a few days a shelf life for

718
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,480
two days

719
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,679
right so what happens people don't

720
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,039
realize that they go in the health food

721
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,240

it's been injured so it's been injured

737
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,000
through high

738
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,960
pressure pasteurization

739
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,360
high pressure pasteurization right it's

740
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,760
not

741
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:34,159
fresh it's only fresh if you saw a dude

742
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,960
there at the health food store running

743
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,840
that celery through that juicer or

744
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,039
if a dude or whoever right or if

745
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,799
somebody working there

746
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,120
right um was was running that juicer

747
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,799
and running juice through it right

748
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,279
meaning creating juice

749
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,159
and then putting that on the shelf for a

750
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,480
day or two

751
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,360
for a day or two you know so that that

752
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,919
right there

753
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,360
that's fresh right and that that is not

754
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,440
going to have a shelf life it's not

755
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,480
going to have a long-term shelf life

756
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,480
i'm just telling you right now

757
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,760
so the juice a little bit

758
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,840
don't add anything to your celery juice

759
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,840
i said it before i'll say it again

760
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,840
don't add anything to your celery juice

761
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,919
what you'll see out there too is those

762
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,880
high pressure pasteurization celery

763
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,480
juices

764
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,240
hpp which don't work

765
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,400
what you'll see is they'll have lemon in

766
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,400
it

767
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,200
it's a bad idea that's strike number two

768
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
and

769
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,600
strike number two you add something to

770
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,120
your celery juice it's not gonna work

771
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,600
the way it's supposed to

772
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:52,720
you dilute the sodium cluster salts

773
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,840
it's what you do right you dilute the

774
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,320
sodium cluster salts

775
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,039
you don't want to add anything to it no

776
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,960
ice

777
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,799
no water no ice and no water

778
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,080
very important to know okay you don't

779
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,960
want to add

780
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,559
ice or water right by the way this is

781
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,039
the mm-900

782
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,039
hds um

783
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,840
i'm working with omega on this juicer

784
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,840
you guys know that

785
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,760
so one of the things that happened that

786
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,919
happens all the time is

787
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,440
people will say they did celery juice

788
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,880
and i've been doing this for so many

789
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,200
years and

790
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,400
people say they i i tried celery juice

791
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
no they didn't

792
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,480
i can't tell you how many people in the

793
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,559
health scene no they tried carrot

794
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,679
celery apple and beets together is what

795
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,840
they tried

796
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,360
no one was juicing celery by itself

797
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,440
therapeutically

798
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,200
therapeutically right it would be this

799
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,760
if if it ever happened it would be

800
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,320
because someone just for some reason

801
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,159
happenstance had only celery in their

802
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,480
fridge and not one other vegetable or

803
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,880
fruit and decided to juice right

804
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,240
but nobody ever did it therapeutically

805
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,200
right as as

806
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,360
as a medicine an herbal medicine and

807
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,360
what i love about

808
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,720
like a good juicer like this one right

809
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,480
here and you can use any juicer if you

810
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,679
have a juicer use any juicer you can use

811
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,640
a blender and strain it through a

812
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,279
cheesecloth

813
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,320
and nut milk bag right what i love about

814
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,080
this juicer is

815
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,320
is this pulp comes out so ridiculously

816
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,440
dry so i'm saving money

817
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,080
that's what i love about this one

818
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,640
so the tr that so where people get

819
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,200
fooled

820
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,360
is they put ice in their celery juice

821
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,279
they add water to their celery juice

822
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,559
if you're gonna blend it don't add water

823
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,080
to your blender

824
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,919
you're just gonna have to keep on

825
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,440
blending it pushing it down and blending

826
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,360
it not adding water

827
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,360
ichota good to see you you're here too

828
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,679
so why is celery juice helping people

829
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,200
heal i'm going to talk about that in a

830
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,240
minute like the power

831
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,080
it has why it's helping people and

832
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,880
bringing their lives back and moving the

833
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,399
needle

834
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,399
to cover that in a couple of minutes

835
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,600
you're someone sensitive to celery juice

836
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,919
there's a lot of bugs in your system a

837
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,440
lot of people got bad bacteria in their

838
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,760
intestinal lining

839
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,880
right right on their intestinal lining

840
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,000
bad

841
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,279
streptococcus that's one of them right

842
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,840
there a lot of people have that strep

843
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,640
right that's a bacteria right there they

844
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,559
got the strep

845
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,000
in there that's what gives you your sibo

846
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,320
your bloating

847
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,200
all kinds of other issues it's that

848
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,039
strep

849
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:53,120
and when you put the celery juice in you

850
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:56,320
you're actually killing off that strep

851
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,919
you're killing off those bugs and you

852
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,600
may only have you may be somebody that

853
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,279
could only do a little bit to start with

854
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,440
you start with a small amount

855
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,440
for somebody that can only do a little

856
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,120
bit of celery juice and that's that's

857
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,240
what you do then you start with a little

858
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,559
bit

859
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,559
um

860
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,279
and don't go like oh don't do a ton of

861
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,120
it

862
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,360
well a ton of it don't do 16 ounces

863
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,080
don't do 32 ounces then start small

864
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,440
do four ounces do two ounces start at

865
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,679
that level

866
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,440
joy and sago says are you doing celery

867
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,799
juice

868
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,200
after doing celery juice for about nine

869
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,559
months my endocrinologist lowered my

870
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:40,000
daily synthroid intake

871
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,000
that's incredible that's incredible

872
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,120
are you doing other tools medical medium

873
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,320
tools too

874
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,480
are you doing medical medium

875
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,480
supplementation protocols as well

876
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,440
because that's there too people can go

877
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,240
as far as they want with their thyroid

878
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,279
problems

879
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,279
when you have the right tools

880
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,039
peggy says don't add water to blended

881
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,320
celery juice peggy you're so right peggy

882
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,679
o'connor thanks for being here

883
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,080
today debbie manning how long is it good

884
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,840
for

885
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:13,200
in the fridge um

886
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,240
celery juice is good in the fridge

887
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,559
for a couple of days but honestly

888
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,520
i don't like i don't like keeping it in

889
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,440
there that long

890
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,720
i don't i like to drink it right after i

891
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,840
made it that's when it's best and the

892
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,240
most powerful

893
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,520
so celery juice is the most powerful and

894
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,679
and at its best

895
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,960
right when it's made fresh yeah

896
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,760
tara appleman tara good to see you uh

897
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,279
audrey antler pretty sure that they they

898
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,320
are being misleading

899
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,360
in saying that it's cold pressed

900
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,520
maybe but then hpp terry you're

901
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,480
spot on incredible actually because

902
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,960
people don't understand

903
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,480
hpp out there so that that's amazing you

904
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
know but then again you know a lot of

905
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,120
stuff

906
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,440
you're really knowledgeable um high

907
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,880
pressure pasteurized hpp which lengthens

908
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,279
the shelf life

909
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,000
but destroys the healing power of it

910
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,559
that was said

911
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,399
so perfectly tara appleman like that was

912
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,159
so perfectly said

913
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,600
it's actually said way better than what

914
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,960
what i was talking about

915
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,840
you know about it i don't even think i

916
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,440
was clear that was really to the point

917
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,480
um incredible really

918
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,559
so i'm gonna strain

919
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,919
some right here and put some in here

920
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,799
through the strainer

921
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,799
so i have

922
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,480
a glass here i think i'm gonna have

923
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,840
plenty left over

924
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,840
in this big tall glass

925
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,840
there you go put that right there for

926
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,880
now

927
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,840
um you know what's incredible about

928
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,320
this juicer is this pulp is dry to the

929
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,440
bone

930
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,120
bone just dry that's it i mean when i

931
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,399
think about it it still blows my

932
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,039
blows my mind really um daniel

933
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,200
anthony i wash i wash my conventional

934
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,399
celery with sodium bicarbonate is that

935
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,640
okay

936
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,399
this week you said you would not consume

937
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,240
sodium i would not eat it no

938
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,600
i i wouldn't i wouldn't take it i

939
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,320
wouldn't consume it

940
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,320
if you're gonna wash with it just wash

941
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,000
the sodium bicarbonate off

942
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,240
make sure that that's washed off good

943
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,039
okay and you can even use a little bit

944
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,919
of natural

945
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,919
dish soap if you wanted to like in like

946
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,399
a little gentle studs in a

947
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,159
big bowl of water but if you want to do

948
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,000
the sodium bicarbonate just make sure

949
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,960
that sodium bicarbonate is

950
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,760
is washed off that's all if it's washed

951
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,120
off then

952
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,120
you know you're looking better

953
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,240
but it could have some residue so make

954
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,600
sure you wash it off carefully

955
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,679
that's all like really good um

956
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,320
i mean honestly with celery you don't

957
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,679
even have if you're using warm water

958
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,200
that's an option right there a lot of

959
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,679
times i'll just use warm water in the

960
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,799
bowl

961
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,159
and i'll massage the celery and rinse it

962
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,080
massage it rinse it

963
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,679
and get the inside of the stalks like

964
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,600
this right here with my thumb

965
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,679
and i'm using just warm water and i'm

966
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,159
not using anything else right

967
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,919
with conventional too but yeah if you

968
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,399
want to use sodium bicarbonate

969
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,200
you can but just make sure you're

970
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,640
washing off

971
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,559
as much as you can of that too and

972
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,960
there's no residue left over

973
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,919
try to be cautious on that level because

974
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
you don't want to ingest sodium

975
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,320
bicarbonate i mean it's you know

976
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,440
but there's a question on the juicer

977
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,360
it's uh

978
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:34,240
mm-900 hds so mm-900 hds

979
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,120
um i mean honestly it saved me so much

980
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,519
money it's

981
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,440
ridiculous at this point i can't tell

982
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,200
you how much celery i would buy

983
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,480
and any juicer i've tried i don't care

984
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,840
what kind of juicer it was and i've

985
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,000
tried them all

986
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,120
it would just be like you're you've got

987
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,120
the wet pulp

988
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,799
right because you're not getting enough

989
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,000
juice out of it so you're literally

990
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,360
losing money while

991
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,440
you're trying to do it and that's why i

992
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,279
like the mm-900 it's an affordable

993
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,840
really compared to so many models out

994
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,480
there

995
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,200
and then it's dry to the bone and that's

996
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,440
the

997
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,840
that's that's incredible it's like my

998
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,760
favorite

999
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,879
um yeah julie

1000
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,520
jewel julie says that juicer is the best

1001
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,639
my pulp is very dry thanks anthony it's

1002
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,560
incredible right

1003
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,159
i've given the the company my full

1004
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,760
endorsement this is omega juicers.com

1005
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,079
you get it there um this is the mm-900

1006
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,440
hds salary juicer i'm working with the

1007
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,359
company

1008
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,280
as far as like to try to really like

1009
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,079
benefit people's lives with this

1010
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,000
adriana adi i don't have any reaction to

1011
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,839
celery juice does that mean i don't have

1012
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,679
bad bacteria

1013
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,960
a couple of things it means is that

1014
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,320
there's a good chance

1015
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,079
that you don't have um

1016
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,919
there's different kinds of bacteria some

1017
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,040
bacteria is more toxic so that when it

1018
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,159
dies

1019
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,399
you you feel it you feel it when it dies

1020
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,159
so that could be some runs that could be

1021
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,359
some extra bloating it could be anything

1022
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,359
like that right so

1023
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,760
you feel it okay then you can have

1024
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,119
different varieties of bad bacteria like

1025
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,760
low-grade strep that's

1026
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,480
not aggressive doesn't it's not as it

1027
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,760
it's not as

1028
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,160
toxic and that's one thing or you don't

1029
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,200
have

1030
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,240
a heck of a lot of toxins in you so that

1031
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,560
the bacteria

1032
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,760
in you isn't loaded they're not like

1033
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,920
loaded guns

1034
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,480
so you know it's it's like or bombs

1035
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,680
right the more toxic stuff you have in

1036
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,000
you

1037
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,119
the more the bad bacteria that you have

1038
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,680
in you gets

1039
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,280
extra toxic so when you kill off that

1040
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,680
bacteria

1041
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,880
there's a splash right there's an

1042
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,119
aftermath awake

1043
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,800
right so there's a good chance maybe you

1044
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,320
don't have a lot of toxins in your

1045
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,359
intestinal tract

1046
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,599
maybe you have more toxins in your liver

1047
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,960
see and when they're in your liver you

1048
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,960
may not feel it like that

1049
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,200
some people they got a ton of stuff in

1050
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,440
their gut a lot of it a lot of toxins a

1051
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,960
lot of bacteria that's eating the toxins

1052
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,200
the minute that celery juice goes down

1053
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,839
in there it's like a bomb blows off

1054
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,640
right these bugs they'll just you know

1055
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,720
we can weaken

1056
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,400
and explode the sodium cluster salt i'll

1057
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,880
just use this orange as a sodium cluster

1058
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,040
salt

1059
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,079
that sodium cluster salt sticks to the

1060
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,119
bug

1061
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,200
that's what happens stay stuck to it

1062
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,240
and stay stuck to it and eats away at

1063
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,680
the bug

1064
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,960
until the bug just falls apart kind of

1065
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,400
kind of concaves in right and when that

1066
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,560
does that

1067
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,599
boom all the poison in that bug comes

1068
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,680
out so

1069
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,200
your bugs might not have a lot of

1070
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,800
different poisons in them that are more

1071
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,440
aggressive some people have bugs and

1072
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,400
they're they're

1073
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,320
filled chalk full of poisons right so

1074
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,320
there's all these different variables

1075
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,839
that's one thing right there um you

1076
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
might have more stuff going on in your

1077
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,079
liver

1078
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,520
you might have some more stuff going on

1079
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,880
in your nervous system might have stuff

1080
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,920
more stuff going on in these other

1081
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,800
places

1082
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,920
but in somebody else to just have a

1083
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,240
trail of

1084
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,000
bad stuff inside their gut right their

1085
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,359
intestinal lining bugs of all

1086
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,079
kinds dehydrated proteins stuck to the

1087
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,280
walls

1088
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,400
with bugs behind them e coli c diff

1089
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,480
streptococcus staph all in their gut

1090
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,240
you know maybe throw a couple of worms

1091
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,680
in there too which aren't parasites

1092
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
they're worms

1093
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,880
it's very important to know two

1094
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,000
different distinct distinct

1095
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,680
distinctions really important

1096
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,640
heidi hey what if what if diagnosed with

1097
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,320
celery allergy well okay okay so be your

1098
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,000
own detective right

1099
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,920
and i talk to doctors about this one all

1100
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,359
the time like what if you're diagnosed

1101
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,599
with a celery allergy and i've been

1102
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,200
asked that by doctors okay it's like

1103
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,359
wait a minute does that mean something

1104
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,359
happens when you eat the celery like

1105
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:42,880
is something happening is it where

1106
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:45,200
is it where your um

1107
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,720
is it where something happens in the

1108
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,079
sense where you eat it and your throat

1109
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,480
closes up

1110
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,320
is that that kind of allergy or you eat

1111
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,680
it and your mouth does something weird

1112
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,320
and swells

1113
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,280
is it that kind of allergy like what's

1114
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,240
going on there is it something like that

1115
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,000
because these are things to consider or

1116
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,760
nothing happens

1117
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,200
nothing happens okay you're just

1118
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,359
just living your life and nothing

1119
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:17,680
happens is it that

1120
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:21,680
and and but yet you had

1121
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,000
a practitioner do you know an all cat or

1122
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,200
or a food sensitivity test and they

1123
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,440
listed the celery on your test

1124
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,280
now here's the first question i'll i'll

1125
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,839
ask you right

1126
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,320
what do you think about this okay what

1127
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,320
do you think about this

1128
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
all of our doctors and practitioners

1129
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,960
don't know why we have chronic illness

1130
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,480
and they don't know what causes

1131
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,000
autoimmune okay

1132
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,920
they're trying their best to help in any

1133
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,200
way they possibly can

1134
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,359
so we have our practitioners

1135
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,200
they might be good at looking and

1136
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,200
reading at a test

1137
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,440
say a test like a food allergy

1138
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,560
sensitivity test right

1139
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,119
but it is is it even right like it is it

1140
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,200
even

1141
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:08,000
on is it even spot on is it even like

1142
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,880
is it right is it correct because what

1143
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,440
i've learned

1144
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,839
is there are foods that help you that

1145
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,599
show up as an allergen on your test

1146
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,599
because that food that's helping you is

1147
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,119
battling the bad stuff

1148
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,119
okay i've seen that in tests too

1149
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,800
i've also seen foods that don't help you

1150
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,320
show up on a food allergy test but

1151
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,720
more more occasions i see foods that are

1152
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,800

helping people show up on the allergy

1154
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,440

people have anxiety depression but it's

1202
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,079
like but yeah they're spot on about

1203
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,839
reading a test

1204
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,240
which is a whole other thing all on its

1205
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,680
own so um

1206
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,599
so what happens is with the food

1207
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,720
sensitivity test if if a

1208
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,800
food is killing off pathogens

1209
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,400
it might show up on that food

1210
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,839
sensitivity test

1211
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,040
if it's killing off bugs and then

1212
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,800
if a food is feeding bugs

1213
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,760
it may show up on that food sensitivity

1214
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,079
test too but are you really allergic to

1215
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,640
it

1216
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,839
see what i talked to this this other

1217
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,560
doctor friend of mine

1218
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,960
many years ago it's like 25 years ago

1219
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,359
right

1220
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,440
and um i talked to him recently and he's

1221
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,720
like 94 years old now you know and i've

1222
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,240
been helping him with his health his

1223
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,040
whole life right all these years and his

1224
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,119
whole life but

1225
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,079
for as long as i've known him i mean his

1226
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,839
his his

1227
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,319
elder life i've been helping him with

1228
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,319
right and not the beginning in his life

1229
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,079
i wasn't born yet but the point is is

1230
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:01,839
that what i've learned

1231
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,960
from him is that he said an allergic

1232
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:08,160
reaction to a fruit or a vegetable

1233
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,200
right or anything like that okay or an

1234
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,000
herb

1235
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,920
you have to experience it where your

1236
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,040
throat's doing something like closing

1237
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,079
off you know

1238
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,520
your mouth swells and you can't breathe

1239
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,599
your lips swell up right and then

1240
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,800
that's how the old-school way to

1241
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,400
determine if you're really allergic

1242
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,079
because the new school

1243
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,599
which he's seen too out there with all

1244
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,640
the food sensitivity tests

1245
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,680
the new school doesn't add up unless

1246
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,000
you're experiencing

1247
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,520
like every time you bite onto a celery

1248
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,040
stick

1249
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,880
do you break out in a rash every time

1250
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,839
you bite out mine in a celery stick your

1251
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,720
throat swallows up

1252
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:48,000
like that's the allergy like that's the

1253
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,000
same thing with any food right

1254
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,520
mirrorless um aw with the cj and

1255
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:57,760
hmds cause an ear and headache

1256
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,400
from detoxing the brain have been in a

1257
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,040
screeching pain for 10 days

1258
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,440
i've never seen it cause any of that um

1259
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,200
but

1260
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,000
if that was me i'd be glad i was doing

1261
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,359
cj

1262
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,880
if that was me do what your doctor tells

1263
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,079
you to do if he doesn't watch on cj or

1264
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,920
not you do what your doctor tells you

1265
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,800
but if it was me

1266
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,520
um i'm i would be happy i'm on cj

1267
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,920
because i'm

1268
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,800
i would be hoping the cj could be

1269
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,680
helping

1270
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,200
so that's not worse than it would be and

1271
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,560
then i always backtrack what else did i

1272
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,960
do what else did i do

1273
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,319
is it a is it a new medical treatment i

1274
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,680
might have gotten involved in

1275
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:36,800
is it is it um exposure

1276
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,280

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,560
what's happening all the migraine stuff

1303
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,920
so that's important to know right there

1304
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,920
juicing a little bit more celery

1305
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,800
so these are all things to consider

1306
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,920
so we covered a little food sensitivity

1307
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,920
stuff is really cool

1308
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,680
i love talking about that because people

1309
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,400
really don't know a lot about it you

1310
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,760
know

1311
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:51,839
so it's so important to have that

1312
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,839
information it really is

1313
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,440
monica l smith says i don't have a

1314
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,640
juicer but i cut up my celery into small

1315
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,079
pieces

1316
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,319
add to my blender add a banana blueberry

1317
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,200
spinach and cilantro love it i don't add

1318
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,040
no water rice

1319
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,400
well first of all i just love that

1320
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,240
you're doing that monica

1321
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,480
i love it okay you want to make a

1322
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,480
smoothie

1323
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,760
you want to make a smoothie and you want

1324
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,040
celery in your smoothie

1325
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,839
it's healthy right it's not going to do

1326
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,839
the same

1327
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,880
thing it's not going to be the same

1328
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,920
thing

1329
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,200
as celery juice on its own okay because

1330
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,640
you're mixing it with something you're

1331
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,960
mixing it with fruits and vegetables

1332
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,319
right

1333
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,319
so you're mixing it with all this other

1334
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,119
stuff so it can't

1335
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,240
do the same thing it's supposed to do

1336
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,599
right

1337
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,359
and but you made a really healthy

1338
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,280
smoothie

1339
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,880
totally now if that was me you do what

1340
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,680
your doctors tells you of course but if

1341
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,599
it was me

1342
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,000
i would add you know bemergey spirulina

1343
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,640
i would add some barley grass juice

1344
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,160
powder

1345
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,079
it wouldn't be the medical medium heavy

1346
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,280
metal detox movie but it would be

1347
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,040
getting closer to it and then

1348
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,200
and then i would i would you know amp it

1349
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,200
up if you're gonna makeshift a smoothie

1350
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,800
of some kind wanting it to help

1351
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,640
but it's not gonna do what celery

1352
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,640
celery does on its own when you juice

1353
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,319
celery by itself okay

1354
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,440
so keep that in mind too that's

1355
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,440
important to keep in mind

1356
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,040
um so

1357
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,160
why does celery help us so much i'll

1358
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,000
give you a little

1359
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,720
give you a little show in a second too

1360
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,119
to see you guys today i'm really happy

1361
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,119
about this

1362
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,480
i'm just juicing a little extra i used

1363
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,000
to be glass a couple seconds ago and i'm

1364
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,280
gonna i'm gonna juice a little bit more

1365
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,240
real quick right now

1366
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,200
i'm gonna pour some as we speak um a

1367
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,000
little extra

1368
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,000
is what i'm doing

1369
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,000
what i like to do is any pulp left over

1370
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,040
i like to press it with my fingers on

1371
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,800
top of it too

1372
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,800
there's so it's just so great

1373
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,200
maria says common sense when i do the

1374
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,960
food sensitivity test

1375
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:14,240
and they told me i am

1376
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:18,079
all w-r-g-i

1377
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,520
gender to spinach oh you're allergic to

1378
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,559
spinach and such

1379
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,160
i instinctively knew it was complete

1380
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,160
 common sense

1381
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,040
yeah yeah and that's that's incredible

1382
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,599
you know

1383
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,599
um so

1384
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,960
it makes a lot of sense exactly honestly

1385
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,240
they'll tell you you're allergic to

1386
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,000
spinach right they'll say you're

1387
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,000
allergic to spinach or something

1388
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,040
and but you're not allergic to spinach

1389
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,880
right

1390
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,960
food sensitivity test i think was one of

1391
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:55,040
the biggest scams

1392
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,880
of our like alternative medicine days it

1393
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,480
was could still at half conventional

1394
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,760
it really hit the alternative market

1395
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,800
more a lot of functional medicine

1396
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,240
doctors do it doesn't mean the

1397
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,200
functional medicine doctor isn't smart

1398
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,280
doesn't mean the

1399
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,280
functional medicine doctor isn't it

1400
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,559
isn't up on some other stuff

1401
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,839
it just means the functional medicine

1402
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,520
doctor doesn't realize that the food

1403
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,400
sensitivity test really has holes in it

1404
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,880
everywhere

1405
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,730
um i don't even trust the labs on any

1406
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,880
level really

1407
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:22,079
[Music]

1408
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,480
so red says what brand of juice

1409
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,520
press that so this is a cold pressed

1410
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,720
juicer this is

1411
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,640
a mega juicers.com but

1412
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,040
it they have a lot of juicers there

1413
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,319
don't get them confused this is the

1414
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,359
mm-900

1415
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:39,119
hds mm-900hds

1416
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,400
this is their celery juicer model but

1417
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,440
you can juice anything in it it's

1418
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,839
incredible

1419
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,720
the pulp comes out so dry it's

1420
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,960
ridiculous

1421
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,079
and i'm saving so much money every every

1422
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,160
year with this now i mean

1423
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,200
it's my end to my second year of saving

1424
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,079
money because i

1425
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,920
get so much so so much celery and i you

1426
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,359
know i juice so much of it it's such a

1427
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,880
great machine

1428
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:03,440
so what do you do with all the pulp

1429
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,480
it goes to my garden valerie yeah goes

1430
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,119
in my garden

1431
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,319
it does don't get thrown by the whole

1432
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,760
thing where

1433
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:14,559
you juice and you're wasting all this

1434
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,760
pulp right even if you threw the pulp

1435
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,599
away

1436
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,920
in the garbage bin and didn't use it for

1437
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,280
your garden you're not wasting it

1438
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,559
there's a reason for that first of all

1439
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,160
you're extracting medicine out of the

1440
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,680
celery so you're using it as a medicine

1441
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,960
you're extracting herbal medicine right

1442
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,680
you're doing herbal medicine so you're

1443
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,520
getting all the

1444
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,280
what you need out of it to turn it into

1445
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,640
something just like a tea

1446
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,599
right just like a tea where you throw

1447
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,720
the tea grounds away the other thing is

1448
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,960
and keep this in mind this is an

1449
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,960
important one too is when we

1450
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,359
eat something it all gets thrown away

1451
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,559
the fiber right all the pulp and fiber

1452
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:50,880
we poop it out in the toilet right so is

1453
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,640
everybody like saving their poop

1454
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,640
because i'm confused about that one i

1455
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,040
had i had some like an r

1456
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,079
an rn registered sorry are not an rn

1457
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,000
nurse an rd

1458
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,680
right registered dietitian confront me

1459
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,119
one time right when i was doing a

1460
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,680
lecture years ago

1461
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,040
and she said okay well that's really

1462
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,000
great so you're just gonna have

1463
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,480
everybody

1464
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,720
throw away and waste all of that fiber

1465
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,920
and pulp and

1466
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,680
that's what you're doing with the

1467
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,960
juicing it's such a bad idea i don't

1468
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,400
believe in juicing i don't believe

1469
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,400
you're doing anything right and i'd be

1470
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,880
like listen listen i said

1471
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,040
everybody who eats she was like you eat

1472
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,720
it you eat it i go okay well you eat it

1473
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,839
and then all the pulp and fiber that you

1474
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,359
can't use

1475
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,559
just like this pulp and fiber here

1476
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,000
because you squeezed everything out of

1477
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,880
it you can't use there's nothing

1478
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,720
in here anymore like this here there's

1479
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,200
nothing you can do with this

1480
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,359
this if you ate the celery this would

1481
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,440
still come out of your back end

1482
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:45,040
this would still come out of you right

1483
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,000
your bottom end would still

1484
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,079
this would come out right here this this

1485
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,800
this would not get utilized

1486
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,280
every single like the pith from the

1487
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,200
orange

1488
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,480
and the the pulp from the orange is

1489
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,400
going to come out of you

1490
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,760
you're not going to utilize all that

1491
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,480
fiber

1492
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
it's going to come out into the toilet

1493
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,040
and

1494
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,880
anything you extract with a good juicer

1495
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,119
especially this juicer right

1496
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,920
because there's nothing left right

1497
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:15,200
anything you extract with a good juicer

1498
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,760
um it you would be doing the same if you

1499
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,079
ate it

1500
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,880
right but the difference is you can't

1501
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,880
get you

1502
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,000
so the question would be we'll just eat

1503
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,400
it then why juice

1504
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,400
it no that's not how you can actually

1505
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,440
create herbal medicine

1506
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,079
a large extraction of an herbal medicine

1507
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,000
that takes

1508
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:36,319
no digestion no digestion

1509
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,559
that right there you don't weaken your

1510
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,400
digestive process you strengthen it you

1511
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,680
strengthen your hcl you strengthen your

1512
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,480
stomach glands that's a whole other

1513
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,839
thing there

1514
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,520
okay so you're strengthening your gut

1515
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,480
your digestion you're strengthening your

1516
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,079
hcl

1517
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,079
um your gastric juice production

1518
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,000
from your stomach glands you're

1519
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,839
strengthening your liver

1520
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,480
that's the difference durable medicine

1521
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,400
you can't strengthen so much

1522
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,640
when you're eating all the fiber and

1523
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,400
pull so the argument is this

1524
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,839
is they're like well let's just eat it

1525
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,119
because you're just wasting it anyway

1526
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:11,040
what are you kidding

1527
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,800
um this is going to come out of you

1528
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,440
everything you eat apples

1529
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,960
meat whatever is coming whatever's left

1530
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,640
of what you're eating that can't be

1531
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,559
broken down

1532
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,480
is going out the toi into the toilet

1533
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,280
right so what are you gonna do i mean

1534
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,920
you may as well

1535
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,640
juice a medicine throw this in your

1536
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,720
garden

1537
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,920
so you're actually being able to use the

1538
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,839
fiber much

1539
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,200
better than if you just ate the stuff

1540
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:35,920
went to the bathroom and it went

1541
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,960
out to the septic right so and that

1542
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,720
that's important to know

1543
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,960
it looks like this model juicer is just

1544
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,599
for celery it's it's not just for celery

1545
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,760
it's for

1546
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,359
everything not recommended for any other

1547
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,200
fruits but actually it is

1548
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,559
am i understanding this right no beverly

1549
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,559
i'm glad you asked it's a really good

1550
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,480
question no it's a juicer for everything

1551
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,000
it just has a celery juice attachment

1552
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,680
and you can use that attachment and

1553
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,359
still juice everything and squeeze a lot

1554
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,119
more out of everything

1555
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,440

greatest

1571
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,599

1623
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,680

so so when someone says oh you're you

1627
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,280
know you're juicing the celery

1628
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,880
what a waste it's like okay well that's

1629
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,599
really funny because

1630
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,440
we're going to poop out all the stuff

1631
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,040
we're not going to use and it's going

1632
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,720
down in the toilet at least with this i

1633
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,440
could throw it in my garden

1634
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,440
some you know

1635
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:28,079
but anyway it the whole thing about

1636
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,839
let's talk about this part too

1637
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:34,240
right so um so as far as

1638
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:37,599
intestinal tract goes let me grab an

1639
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,599
intestinal tract really quick

1640
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,000
i'm going to grab a liver too i'm going

1641
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,000
to show you guys

1642
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,799
all right so what i like to do is i like

1643
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,160
to think about what the celery juice is

1644
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,640
doing when it's going through my gut the

1645
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,160
beginning

1646
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,440
to begin with when it starts at the

1647
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,720
stomach which i don't have a stomach

1648
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,920
right now but that's okay

1649
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:02,319
meaning i don't have a stomach here but

1650
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,000
what it does is it already charges up

1651
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:05,680
those stomach glands

1652
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,280
it's bringing back the stomach gland so

1653
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,280
the trace mineral salts the sodium

1654
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,880
cluster salts are bringing back

1655
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,559
the the stomach glands it's the one

1656
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,400
thing right there off you know

1657
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,599
right off the start with your stomach

1658
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,720
when it leaves your stomach starts

1659
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,359
heading down into the

1660
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,960
the duodenum right and when it heads

1661
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,079
down to your wad a lot of people have h

1662
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,520
pylori

1663
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,599
you don't know it but just almost

1664
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,799
everybody has h pylori

1665
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,240
and and they'll have the h pylori at

1666
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,799
different levels some people have it

1667
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,599
where they ca

1668
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:35,280
it can't be detected it's not at this

1669
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,960
raging level

1670
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,559
so and that's what most people have at

1671
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,000
but it's there so as it starts heading

1672
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,319
down to the duodenum it's

1673
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,720
knocking down some h pylori left and

1674
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,720
right so the celery juice

1675
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,160
is going through and just boom right

1676
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,240
then it hits

1677
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,760
the the top of your small intestinal

1678
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,599
tract okay

1679
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,799
where there's always some bacteria

1680
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,160
sitting right there all on its own

1681
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,000
sometimes viruses too

1682
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,480
viruses and bacteria right some some

1683
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,240
unproductive

1684
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,960
fungus bad fungus right fungus

1685
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,359
mold right and even though mold doesn't

1686
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,040
cause

1687
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,720
a big problem when it's in us the

1688
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,200
viruses and bacteria cause the most

1689
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,359
problem

1690
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,319
you'll still have some mold in there why

1691
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,839
have that in there

1692
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,920
everybody has it in there but celery

1693
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,119
juice can start to clean that up

1694
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,559
so it starts to go down to small

1695
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,240
intestinal tract and now it's heading

1696
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,640
down and it's hitting different pockets

1697
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,520
what happens with everybody is our small

1698
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,520
intestinal tract

1699
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:30,400
is pocketing it's it's expanding in some

1700
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,799
areas

1701
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,760
shrinking in some areas expanding in

1702
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,799
some areas

1703
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:40,480
shrinking in some areas right or it's

1704
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:43,359
the same size but internally

1705
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,799
it's shrinking because it's inflamed

1706
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,640
that's the other thing too

1707
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,160
you could have narrowing some people

1708
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,440
have a lot of narrowing some people have

1709
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,880
a little bit of neurons some people have

1710
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,559
expansion some people have

1711
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,160
mega colon colon

1712
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,400
and that's with you know the large

1713
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,119
intestinal tract mostly with mega colon

1714
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,960
right

1715
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,680
where it just keeps on it keeps on

1716
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,680
expanding it loses its elasticity it's

1717
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,400
losing that it's starting to expand

1718
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,440
right diverticulitis but diverticulitis

1719
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,920
is all that e coli

1720
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,760
streptococcus right c death

1721
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,240
and mostly strep and e coli with

1722
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,319
diverticulitis right diverticulosis

1723
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,440
so as the celery is going down it's got

1724
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,599
a lot of work to do

1725
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,599
it's heading on down and it's starting

1726
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,720
to just get into those pockets and nooks

1727
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,760
and crannies right

1728
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,200
you know what happens when you guys

1729
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,640
vacuum your house what are you doing

1730
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,000
you're like vacuuming in the bathroom

1731
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,079
then you vacuum in the corner and

1732
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,040
vacuum here you're vacuuming this corner

1733
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,000
and trying to get all the different

1734
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,599
corners right

1735
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,280
the celery juice is trying to hit every

1736
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,480
corner as it's going on down and running

1737
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,720
on through you

1738
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,599
and and that's what's happening you guys

1739
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,599
and it's

1740
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,160
it'll run into a pocket of e coal like e

1741
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,720
coli festers these little pockets

1742
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,960
they fester and here's the other thing

1743
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,720
inside your small intestinal tract right

1744
00:58:52,960 --> 00:59:00,000
you got you got caked caked on

1745
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:01,119
um um putrified proteins

1746
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,599
they're kicked down the walls of your

1747
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,720
small intestinal tract you got rancid

1748
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:09,119
fat that hardened you got actual

1749
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,720
fat that hardened all in the small

1750
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,480
intestinal tract right i've talked to a

1751
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,599
lot of colon surgeons over the years

1752
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,720
intestinal surgeons you know

1753
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,720
gastrointestinal

1754
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,160
surgeries that that people have had that

1755
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,440
i would talk to the surgeons

1756
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:24,799
and and so forth right and and

1757
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,319
they would talk about how the inside of

1758
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,559
the intestinal tract when they really

1759
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:32,240
took a good look the inside

1760
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:34,079
from the eye not from the scope

1761
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,680
the eye sees things that the scope can't

1762
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,880
see and the scope sees things that the

1763
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,839
eye can't see

1764
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,839
the scope sees things when your

1765
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,400
intestinal tract is sitting inside of

1766
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,640
you

1767
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,319
right so the scope goes up you right you

1768
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,119
know you know endoscopy

1769
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,680
colonoscopy right but what happens is

1770
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,240
that

1771
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,000
from the surgeon's eye is a whole other

1772
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,079
story when they have a piece of small

1773
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,559
intestinal tract that they cut out

1774
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,319
so they cut out two feet of your colon

1775
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,920
or small intestinal tract combined or

1776
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,280
they cut your ilium out and part of your

1777
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,119
small intestinal tract and part of your

1778
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:09,040
colon out right

1779
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:11,359
and they slice it open and look inside

1780
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,720
a good gastrointestinal surgeon right a

1781
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:16,079
good surgeon

1782
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,839
colon surgeon will see you know things

1783
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,480
differently in a lot of people and a lot

1784
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:22,480
of times the higher you go up

1785
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,799
into the small intestinal tract the more

1786
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:28,480
caked on rancid fats built up in the

1787
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:31,119
testosterone lining the more um the more

1788
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,680
uh putrified proteins hardened on the

1789
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,119
lining

1790
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:37,440
up higher right celery juice starts to

1791
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:39,760
work all the way down right the top

1792
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,000
the the bottom of your stomach there's a

1793
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,880
little divot that starts to occur

1794
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,760
and sitting in it is all this junk and

1795
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,079
sludge

1796
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,680
celery just starts to knock that down it

1797
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,079
gets down your dwadding starts to knock

1798
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,599
off each pylori boom boom boom

1799
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,160
starts to get down the small intestinal

1800
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,240
tract starts to hit pockets of e coli

1801
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,400
streptococcus starts to go through there

1802
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:02,720
heading on down head down down

1803
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,240
it's it's wham it's hitting things and

1804
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,599
then

1805
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:10,160
it gets absorbed and starts heading up

1806
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:13,359
the hepatic portal highway

1807
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:16,720
veins and that are

1808
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:20,240
driving up to your

1809
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,160
liver right okay and you know veins

1810
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,760
arteries that are running in and out of

1811
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,960
the liver right so all of a sudden now

1812
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,079
you've got it going up the paddock

1813
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,119
portal highway

1814
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,559
heading to the liver and that's where

1815
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,119
the solar just has to go and when it

1816
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,520
goes there

1817
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,200
we do some shock treatment you got a

1818
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,920
liver full of all kinds of poisons and

1819
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,520
toxins

1820
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,040
stagnant sluggish liver giving you

1821
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,400
gaining weight the reason why you're

1822
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,240
gaining weight

1823
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,760
all of it why does celery juice start

1824
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,920
fixing things where we start losing

1825
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,440
weight start getting our lives back

1826
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,880
because it's getting into that liver

1827
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,119
it's cleaning up that stagnant sluggish

1828
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,799
liver you got viruses inside that liver

1829
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,359
right here you got viruses inside that

1830
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:54,559
liver

1831
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:56,720
you know and all of a sudden boom

1832
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,160
the celery juice is hitting it so this

1833
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,160
is this isn't

1834
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,359
be open-hearted you said best medical

1835
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,720
medium community

1836
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:06,319
medical mean community is the best

1837
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,640
community ever in health uh

1838
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:10,720
raquel jane i've been doing it for two

1839
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,559
years doesn't help me at all

1840
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:16,799
have lime now mold h by laurie sibo i

1841
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:20,079
was praying it worked it would help

1842
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:23,520
um so here's what you have to think

1843
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,119
about what would happen if you weren't

1844
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,839
doing celery juice for the last two

1845
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,720
years

1846
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:29,680
with your h pylori and everything else

1847
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,280
would it be

1848
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,640

have i looked in the lime chapter so if

1904
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,440
that was me

1905
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,280
i'd be in the lyme disease chapter right

1906
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,760
here and i would be looking at like

1907
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,160
the lyme protocol take it to your doctor

1908
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,680
if it's you take it to your doctor

1909
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,359
do what your doctor tells you but take

1910
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,119
it to your doctor see what he thinks

1911
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,960
but what i would be doing is the medical

1912
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,079
medium protocols i'd start to read the

1913
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,160
supplement chapter

1914
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,440
learning what's happening in here that's

1915
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,680
important what kind of

1916
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,839
supplements are you taking right like

1917
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,480
what kind what kind of supplements

1918
01:04:55,839 --> 01:05:00,319
now for i want you to do what your

1919
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,160
doctor says but what i recommend a

1920
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,200
family member when when they get lyme

1921
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,440
disease right

1922
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,880
i recommend like the vimergy cats claw

1923
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,960
the vimersy zinc

1924
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,319
the vimergy vitamin c these are just a

1925
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,319
few things right there

1926
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:14,319
so that's a critical aspect all on its

1927
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:17,359
own the vimergy lysine

1928
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:19,520
no msg no alcohol no added

1929
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:21,680
no added natural flavors which is the

1930
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:26,160
msg that's important too

1931
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:29,359
am i taking goldenseal for my h pylori

1932
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:31,359

what i recommend for a family member you

1938
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,839
do what your doctor tells you to do but

1939
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,160
this is what i would do

1940
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:45,440
with my family i'd be like are you on

1941
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,359

01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,119
you know are you on the micro sea are

1943
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:51,599

disease we gotta get to that epstein bar

1945
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,480
we gotta get to the cause of what you're

1946
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:56,319
really going through

1947
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,839

what is it you're doing 32 ounces so

1952
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,520

1953
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,760
right

1954
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,359
and then you know i would be another

1955
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,240
thing i would learn from medical medium

1956
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,000
information

1957
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,760

1971
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,920
supplements out there with msg and

1972
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,359

would you know what's going on like and

1975
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,280
i would be my own detective and saying

1976
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,000
you know i need to look into the medical

1977
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,520
media books

1978
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,039
i need to know where i'm stepping into

1979
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,720
those potholes i need to know where i'm

1980
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,359
tripping up i need to know

1981
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,960
why am i not getting better how many

1982
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:06,240
blood draws have i had

1983
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,200
now i know as is being in this in this

1984
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,880
for so many years

1985
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,559
that people with lyme disease have the

1986
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,200
blood sucked out of them

1987
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,559
they have the blood sucked out of them

1988
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,119
three years ago

1989
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,599
someone could be getting 40 vials 30

1990
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,079
vials

1991
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,200
10 vials regularly and then they get

1992
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,400
sicker two years

1993
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,839
later because they've had so much blood

1994
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,920
taken from them before that

1995
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:31,200
so so it's not just hey celery just

1996
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,480
isn't working for me

1997
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:36,240
celery juice is trying to save save you

1998
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,880
while there's all these other things

1999
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,559
going on dr fong celery powder isn't

2000
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,240
effective at all oh it's terrible

2001
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,079
save your money on that real salary your

2002
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,720
celery powder is awful

2003
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,160
it's terrible terrible it's the worst

2004
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:51,119
worst stuff

2005
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,240
it's just this so all these things

2006
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:56,160
matter you guys

2007
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:59,119
all these things are critical

2008
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:01,119
esther what if someone doesn't want to

2009
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,480
do mono cleanse to give digestion a

2010
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,599
break

2011
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,599
can we do a juice cleanse all juices

2012
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,280
look i'm not a big fan of the juice

2013
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,319
cleanses because what happens is you go

2014
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,599
under calorie

2015
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:13,440
well do what your doctor says your

2016
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,520
doctor wants energy just let's do it

2017
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,799
but esther what happens is juice

2018
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,920
cleanses you go

2019
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:22,960
under calorie then you go under calorie

2020
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,960
too long right so i don't mind a juice

2021
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,640
cleanse for two days but is it a juice

2022
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,319
cleanse that that's actually like

2023
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,480
efficient enough is it does it have

2024
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:31,600
enough glucose the reason why people are

2025
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,279
sick is because

2026
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,719
they're missing the mineral salts and

2027
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,159
the glucose so when you go on these

2028
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,839
juice cleanses it doesn't mean it's the

2029
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:39,359
right even the right combinations it

2030
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,880
doesn't mean it's enough calories to

2031
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:44,239
give you the glucose and then

2032
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:46,159
you can tank right and in juice cleanses

2033
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:47,520
if they're not done right can lower your

2034
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:49,199
immune system

2035
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,839
