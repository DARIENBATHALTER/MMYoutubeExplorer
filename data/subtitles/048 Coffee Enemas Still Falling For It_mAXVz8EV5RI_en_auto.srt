bad to themselves but I don't blame them

trendy trap that becomes a new trendy

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,080

that's so great anyway you got to hold

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the coffee in for like 3 minutes but it

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,479
can get really uncomfortable and that's

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,119
okay because you can put on something

38
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,280
relaxing like a podcast or something or

whatever works for you like whatever

41
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,600
your truth is just do it anyway this is

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,399
going to be help ful for detoxification

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,520
of blood and the liver and bile and I'm

44
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,720
energetic after I do it and I feel

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,120
really good it's like so amazing anyway

46
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,040
let's get

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,040
started coffee Animas are popular

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,120
they're

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,760
longstanding theoretically the idea is

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,280
it cleanses toxins out of the liver

51
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,120
that's a great idea we want toxins out

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,560
of the liver we want our liver cleansed

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,160
and healthier why not so that's why

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,920
coffee enemas really sound good and then

55
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,560
if we get sick chronically sick we hear

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,720
about coffee animus being a Panacea like

57
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,239
an alltime fixer upper if we have a

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,440
problem a disease any kind of condition

59
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,080
if we're suffering in any way we're

60
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,080
going to hear from somebody somewhere

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,840
whether on social or online or at a

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,760
clinic do a coffee enema it will help

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,120
you it may even save you and coffee

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,360
enemas used to be just involved in

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,720
alternative medicine so it was an

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,319
alternative medicine thing it was never

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,560
conventional medicine but now it has

68
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,799
crossed over into conventional medicine

69
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,799
so both fields of medicine say coffee

70
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:26,239
enemas they're good for you and they all

71
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:29,439
are parting the same claim a perfectly

72
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,599
good reasonable claim detoxifying the

73
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,599
liver

74
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:37,239
does help you heal but there's a problem

75
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:41,040
the first problem here's where we get

76
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:45,480
into trouble coffee to begin with is

77
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:49,360
strong very strong but not in a good way

78
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,680
coffee is also harsh very harsh not in a

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
good way extremely

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,519
acidic

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,720
dehydrating highly

82
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,760
astringent and

83
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,000
overstimulating because coffee is a drug

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,519
and people love their drug people love

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,720
their drugs and coffee is one of those

86
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,560
addictive drugs that people don't want

87
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,320
to let go it's hard for them to let go

88
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,600
it's a massive industry and people love

89
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,000
their coffee and that's why the coffee

90
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,440
enema sounds so good there are two kinds

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,680
of people in the world one kind of

92
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,440
person will get an Ena any kind of Ena a

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,919
water enema some kind of Solution that's

94
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
pharmaceutical grade and then there's

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,600
the other kind of person in the world

96
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:43,400
that will never ever ever get an enema

97
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,240
even if they're on their dying breath in

98
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,400
a hospital bed somewhere and this is the

99
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,639
last time they're going to be here on

100
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,840
this planet they will never get an enema

101
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:58,120
but because everybody drinks coffee and

102
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,280
loves coffee so much that a bridge gets

103
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,759
put in between the two kinds of people

104
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,400
in the world and even some of the most

105
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,440
stubborn people that would never get an

106
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,120
enema will consider an enema only

107
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
because it's a coffee enema it's the

108
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,919
only way they'll ever even consider it

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,759
they may still not do it but there are

110
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,160
some people that break and they break

111
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,600
because they think about it and they're

112
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,199
like coffee I like coffee okay doctor or

113
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,800
practitioner or health coach I'm going

114
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,800
to do it now remember coffee is really

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,440
acidic extremely

116
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,960
astringent very harsh so what happens

117
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:42,400
when we drink coffee we have a buffer

118
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:46,319
our stomach is that poison control

119
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,080
Shield it buffers things that aren't

120
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,520
good for us it buffers things that are

121
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,600
really really harsh so our stomachs are

122
00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:00,319
designed to actually try to withhold

123
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,160
poison as long as possible in Hope hopes

124
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:08,840
that we vomit the poison up or that we

125
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,080
get a chance to exit the poison up the

126
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,039
esophagus out of our mouth and out of

127
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,800
our body so our stomach is a buffer zone

128
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,720
it holds on to things not just for

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,360
digestion not just for

130
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,199
stimulation not just for enzymes to

131
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,960
start breaking things down our stomach

132
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:33,440
purposely holds things in there just

133
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:36,520
long enough in case something is toxic

134
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,599
or poisonous in case we ingested

135
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,800
something that's extremely bad for us

136
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,840
this doesn't mean coffee makes you

137
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,160
vomit that's not what this is it may

138
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,800
make somebody vomit out there I'm sure

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,560
somebody doesn't like coffee or they're

140
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,400
sensitive to it and they vomit it out if

141
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,120
they drink it but it's not meant to

142
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,199
happen that way but it nevertheless

143
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,400
it's a harsh toxic poison that sits

144
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,280
inside the stomach and the stomach

145
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,520
buffers it it buffers the

146
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,479
acidity which is extremely harsh it

147
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,199
buffers the

148
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:21,479
stringency and it buffers the caffeine

149
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,879
most importantly the caffeine our

150
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,479
stomachs hold on to the caffeine so when

151
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,840
we drink a cup of coffee our stomach is

152
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,280
holding on to the coffee as long as it

153
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,360
can because it's holding on to the

154
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,919
caffeine it identifies the caffeine

155
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,080
hangs on to it so it disperses in small

156
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,759
amounts into the

157
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,319
bloodstream it's holding the caffeine

158
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,639
back as much as possible and as long as

159
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,840
possible so only

160
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,240
increments of the caffeine enter into

161
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,800
the bloodstream not all at once because

162
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,479
when it enters all at once into the

163
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,000
bloodstream it attacks the heart our

164
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:08,479
stomachs have a two-step identification

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,080
process One Step the stomach knows

166
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,479
what's entering into it the tissue

167
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:18,879
itself is experiencing it and absorbing

168
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:21,840
it second step a signal from the brain

169
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,560
matches the stomach's understanding they

170
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,280
both connect the brain the nervous

171
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,840
system sends a signal telling the

172
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:35,039
stomach to hold on to that caffeine as

173
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,800
long as possible the stomach agrees

174
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,839
communicates with the brain and holds on

175
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,399
to the caffeine as long as possible and

176
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,880
one of the most important reasons this

177
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,160
communication happens to hold on to that

178
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,640
poison that caffeine as long as possible

179
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,320
inside the stomach is because if it was

180
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,399
released all at once there would be an

181
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,519
emergency the emergency would be

182
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:04,959
adrenaline being released on a large

183
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:08,760
scale a large release of adrenaline so

184
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:12,880
large it can injure and damage the brain

185
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,920
heart and liver and then there's the

186
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,720
communication between adrenals and the

187
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:22,279
stomach they have a lot in common they

188
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,240
protect each other adrenals protect the

189
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,920
stomach the stomach protects the

190
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,240
adrenals there's a reason for that too

191
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,079
much adrenaline released too many times

192
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,279
like adrenaline addiction which people

193
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:38,600
actually suffer from all the time in

194
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:42,200
different ways too much adrenaline

195
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,160
release damages the nerves in the lining

196
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,880
of the stomach and guess where those

197
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,079
nerves come from they come from the

198
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,680
Vegas nerves and when these nerves get

199
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:58,200
hypers sensitive from being adrenaline

200
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,399
injured then the person gets nauseous

201
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,200
and hypers sensitive

202
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,600
and can start to feel their food feel it

203
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,760
so much they get confused thinking

204
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,760
they're not digesting their food anymore

205
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,600
so they start saying things like well I

206
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:19,000
can't eat lettuce and kale and cilantro

207
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,120
and parsley I can't eat zucchinis I

208
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,959
can't eat raw broccoli I can't eat

209
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,720
cucumbers and tomatoes it's too harsh it

210
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,000
feels like it's bothering my stomach and

211
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,880
it's not

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,440
digesting what people don't realize the

213
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,079
food's digesting but it doesn't feel

214
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,160
like it's digesting because the nerves

215
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:45,240
have been irritated and injured the

216
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:49,600
nerves that align the stomach make no

217
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,680
mistake coffee has caffeine caffeine

218
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,839
ignites

219
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,360
adrenaline everybody's high on

220
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,639
adrenaline they're high in their coffee

221
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,040
they're high in their caffeine and that

222
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:05,320
caffeine enters the organs enters the

223
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:09,680
brain the kidneys the liver the spleen

224
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,959
the pancreas and the stomach and that

225
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,279
stomach has all those nerves and the

226
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:17,120
caffeine over time irritates those

227
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:20,000
nerves but the stomach holds on to the

228
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,680
caffeine as long as it can with the

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,480
communication it has with the brain to

230
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:30,000
stop an adrenaline release a

231
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,839
superpowered surge of adrenaline so the

232
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,680
stomach releases little spurts of

233
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,440
caffeine into the bloodstream which

234
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,000
ignites the adrenaline to only rise so

235
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,120
much and that's the high everybody runs

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,160
on all day long especially if they're

237
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,320
intermittent fasting or they're not

238
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,639
eating much and they're on coffee all

239
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,880
day and they're doing their errands and

240
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,480
their appointments and they're high on

241
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,519
little spurts of

242
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,760
adrenaline and that adrenaline even on

243
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,600
low low Amounts is still

244
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,240
hyper irritating to the nerves along

245
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,399
with the caffeine being irritating to

246
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,120
the nerves as well it's a double whammy

247
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,279
so many people are worried about aging

248
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,560
they're trying to do the whole

249
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,560
anti-aging thing and Longevity but

250
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,839
caffeine is the ultimate

251
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:24,160
Ager and everybody's on it almost

252
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,680
everybody they're living off of it many

253
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,199
of them women who are worried about

254
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,800
their skin and are worried about getting

255
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:35,000
older and worried about their looks and

256
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,839
how and their appearance are consuming

257
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,720
caffeine on a rate and on a scale it's

258
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,959
unimaginable at this point in history

259
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,120
and a lot of women nowadays are worried

260
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,160
about what they eat how they take care

261
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,920
of themselves what they're doing for

262
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,399
themselves their exercise routines and

263
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,800
the Spas they go to to get lymphatic

264
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,120
drainage and the saas and everything

265
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,720
else they're doing so what they're

266
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,760
essentially doing is

267
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,320
battling the bad that they're doing

268
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,639
they're hooked on the

269
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,079
caffeine and then they're trying to

270
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,959
counter it without realizing it with all

271
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,480
these other things they're doing so it's

272
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,880
a constant War it's like doing some

273
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,160
things that could be

274
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,079
helpful to support the thing that isn't

275
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,680
helpful while not even realizing this is

276
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,120
happening they need their coffee they

277
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,440
need their caffeine to function to do

278
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,360
their appointments to do anything at all

279
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,480
all day long and the coffe is aging them

280
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,600
the caffeine's Aging them and at the

281
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,440
same time they're using the caffine to

282
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,880
give them strength and energy and

283
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,680
fortitude to go and do all their Marriot

284
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,320
of appointments all day long that are

285
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:52,480
anti-aging and then there's the men the

286
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,519
new man not the old man in the past that

287
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,680
drank coffee in the morning during his

288
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:01,720
break time maybe one more at the end of

289
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:05,360
the day no talking about men that are in

290
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,880
the saas at the Spas every day doing

291
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,639
their exercise routines sitting there on

292
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,920
social all day long and they're hooked

293
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,959
on caffeine too and the caffeine is

294
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,720
giving them energy and giving them

295
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,839
fortitude to push through their day and

296
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,839
get all their appointments done they're

297
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,360
doing things that are aging them like

298
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,199
the coffee and the caffeine and the

299
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,440
energy drinks and that same time they're

300
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,160
trying to do other things that are

301
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,279
anti-aging

302
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,560
when coffee enters our stomach it

303
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,880
challenges our pH

304
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,040
environment it challenges our stomach's

305
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,839
environment our gastric

306
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,839
glands our gastric juices our

307
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:52,600
HCL but our stomachs can handle many

308
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:56,399
times strong Brew they can handle it

309
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,759
enough it hinders our stomachs it lowers

310
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,759
our HCL over time which breaks down

311
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:05,279
protein protein it destroys our gastric

312
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,800
glands throughout the years but

313
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,720
nevertheless our stomach is still

314
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,399
designed to handle a punch and to handle

315
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,240
that strong brew and then there's a

316
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,320
group of people who are

317
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,320
sensitive they've been sensitive their

318
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,959
whole lives or at least a part of their

319
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,600
life they have a pancreas issue

320
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:32,199
gallbladder problems weak stomachs maybe

321
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,000
Crohn's k or IBS maybe some kind of

322
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:38,279
digestive compromise or

323
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,120
distress maybe they have neurological

324
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:45,560
symptoms anxiety Tremors tingles

325
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,360
numbness brain fog aches and pains and

326
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,199
maybe even struggling with insomnia and

327
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,519
they know coffee doesn't sit right with

328
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,600
them and that leads us to another two

329
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:59,680
kinds of people in the world one doesn't

330
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,720
have a lot of neurological problems

331
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,480
neurological symptoms they're not

332
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,079
struggling with chronic illness they got

333
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,399
in the moment a stomach of

334
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:13,079
Steel and they can do fine with coffee

335
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,120
they can drink it all day long and every

336
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,360
day and then the other kind of person in

337
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,880
the world the chronically sick the

338
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,079
chronically ill somebody who's hypers

339
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,399
sensitive their nervous system is

340
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:28,399
challenged their immune systems are

341
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,880
challenged they're struggling they may

342
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,639
even be suffering and both these types

343
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:38,880
of people in the world get told to do a

344
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,360
coffee enema and that takes us to the

345
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,279
coffee enem itself because if you're

346
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,839
somebody who's chronically sick and you

347
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,959
have neurological symptoms and you get a

348
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,279
coffee

349
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:56,079
enema the damage the injuries the harm

350
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:58,319
could be much more serious than if

351
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,839
you're somebody that hey stomach of

352
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:03,440
Steel no neurological symptoms in the

353
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,000
moment in their life and they're getting

354
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,760
a coffee enema and there's a big

355
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,839
difference it's hurting them but they

356
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,400
can handle it better and then what about

357
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:18,439
dosages what kind of Eno are we talking

358
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,079
about what is the dosage because what

359
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:25,559
happens out there is you can take a

360
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:28,400
woman who's 5et tall 99 lb and they'll

361
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:33,880
stick the same amount of coffee in that

362
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:39,080
woman is a would a man that's

363
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:41,000
6'4 220 lb and is the woman sick with

364
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,840
chronic illness and neurological

365
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,559
problems versus the man who may not have

366
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,120
any neurological problems in the moment

367
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:51,160
at all and the same amount of coffee is

368
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,720
going into both of them once again

369
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,880
another huge flaw now there's a big

370
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,520
difference from drinking coffee to doing

371
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,760
a coffee enema when anything goes in the

372
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,120
stomach regardless if it's a can of soda

373
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,480
if it's something else if it's a food if

374
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,640
it's a glass of milk if it's a parasite

375
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,280
you picked up at a restaurant eating out

376
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,679
regardless of what it is the stomach is

377
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:19,120
built to deal with it but if it goes up

378
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,240
the rectum if it goes into the anus if

379
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,120
it goes up into the colon and it's

380
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,280
forced up there it's a different story

381
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,440
the stomach doesn't apply anymore the

382
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,360
stomach's ability to buffer to delegate

383
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,159
to protect to withhold all gone all of

384
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,880
it out the window it's an entirely

385
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,200
different thing we're talking about now

386
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,799
the hydrochloric acid in your colon is

387
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,760
much different than when it was when it

388
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,600
started in your stomach produced by your

389
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,640
stomach glands it was fired up it was

390
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:54,080
strong it had strength to it by the time

391
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,200
it gets to the colon and almost out of

392
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,039
the rectum that hydrochloric acid is

393
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,640
nothing to what it used used to be it

394
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:04,880
has no protective measures anymore it

395
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,159
has no ability to digest or break down

396
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,600
anything or pull apart anything it's

397
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,799
useless it just becomes part of your

398
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,840
elimination now so let's talk about what

399
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:19,559
happens when you insert coffee up your

400
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,960
anus so I just got back from the

401
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:29,440
drugstore let's see it says open up

402
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:33,080
here let's see undo wrapper pull tab um

403
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,400
connect it says unscrew unscrew I'm

404
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,960
going to unscrew this top

405
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,919
here then directions did you prepare

406
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,840

this up but I I can't do this without

410
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,640

relax me a little bit let me

412
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:05,159
see all right all right

413
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:08,200
so take this pipe and um insert it it

414
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,600
says insert it into your

415
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:15,240
rectum okay all

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:49,039
out I think I have to reinsert it oh God

425
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,159
it's getting everywhere I have to get

426
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,679
some

427
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,640
towels our liver's protective buddy and

428
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,280
friend is its

429
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,679
stomach the stomach the liver's stomach

430
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,080
our stomach the body's stomach it is the

431
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,679
liver's best friend it buffers

432
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,000
everything and when it's not there and

433
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,200
it doesn't have the livers back and

434
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,760
something

435
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,880
enters up through the rectum into the

436
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,880
colon and into the bloodstream from

437
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,600
behind not in our mouth but from

438
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,600
underneath us behind it's an entirely

439
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,240
different story and our liver is not

440
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,039
protected anymore and our liver is very

441
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,240
vulnerable our livers are never meant to

442
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:43,559
take a direct hit a direct attack or a

443
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:46,919
direct punch it never gets a direct

444
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,960
slam everything that hits the liver has

445
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,159
always been buffered including alcohol

446
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,279
when somebody drinks a whole bunch of

447
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:56,679
alcohol which is going to affect the

448
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:59,679
liver in a bad way that alcohol sits in

449
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:02,480
the stomach and gets buffed Ed by the

450
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,440
stomach and time relased into the

451
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,400
bloodstream so the liver doesn't get the

452
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:13,320
first punch and our colon is not a

453
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:17,799
buffer it's not our stomach it has

454
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:21,120
nothing to do with our stomach as far as

455
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:24,559
how the layout works with the tissue the

456
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,640
thickness the design the cell

457
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:32,080
structures all of it is different the

458
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:37,039
colon is not a buffer for the liver on

459
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:40,360
any level the colon instead is a direct

460
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,960
passageway to the liver and that might

461
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,240
sound like a good thing because we're

462
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:50,279
trying to detoxify the liver with the

463
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,640
coffee but it's not a good thing anytime

464
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:55,320
anything enters the rectum and is

465
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,520
released into the colon it sets off an

466
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,279
adrenaline release an adrenaline

467
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,240
response

468
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,400
but it doesn't mean it's the end of the

469
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,120
world so if someone takes somebody's

470
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,919
temperature with a rectum thermometer

471
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,880
and it enters into the rectum some

472
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,720
adrenaline is going to be released your

473
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,919
adrenals are going to respond to

474
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,520
protection

475
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,679
method and if someone sticks the hose or

476
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,279
the pipe to an enema bag into the rectum

477
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,799
it's going to create an adrenaline

478
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,600
response and adrenaline is going to be

479
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,320
released it's not the end of the world

480
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,720
but it depends on what's being put into

481
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,600
the rectum into the body and into the

482
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,559
bloodstream when when it comes down to

483
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,960
coffee that adrenaline is responding and

484
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:47,240
those adrenals are responding to the

485
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,000
caffeine in the coffee so when caffeine

486
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:53,960
goes into the colon through the rectum

487
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,960
an Urgent Response occurs the emergency

488
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,039
the button is pressed the adrenals start

489
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,960
to react instantly

490
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,679
and the adrenals start to flood large

491
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,760
amounts of epinephrine large amounts of

492
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,200
adrenaline into the bloodstream

493
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,720
immediately and then the person's in

494
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,559
fight or flight so if the person's

495
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,480
laying on the bathroom floor and they're

496
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,919
doing an enema and they're sitting there

497
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,760
or they're laying there and they're in

498
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,039
their bathroom they're in fight or

499
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,880
flight they're in something they're not

500
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,960
supposed to be in they're in something

501
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,919
that's reserved for a real problem

502
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,440
an outside Invader some kind of other

503
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,840
emergency some kind of bad news it isn't

504
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,720
supposed to be happening this way but

505
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:45,080
yet their whole body is going into fight

506
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:49,000
or flight so as they're pumping innocent

507
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:52,039
coffee up their anus into their colon

508
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,799
into their small intestinal tract

509
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,760
because it can go that far and then all

510
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,960
that caffeine is surging through and

511
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,600
pushing through through the colon and

512
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,240
the small intestinal tract filling the

513
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,919
bloodstream getting to the brain the

514
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,559
brain's also reacting communicating with

515
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,520
the adrenals and now the adrenals are in

516
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,399
super high gear they're releasing even

517
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,799
more heavily heavily bombardment of

518
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:22,640
adrenaline into the bloodstream because

519
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:25,840
this is an urgent situation the body is

520
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,960
under great threat and then something

521
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,320
magical happens the person

522
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,880
starts to feel better because they're

523
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,240
high the person is feeling the effects

524
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,880
of an adrenaline High adrenaline is

525
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,880
pumping through the entire body it can

526
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,120
be

527
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,720
euphoric they're feeling something

528
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,840
they're feeling elevated they're feeling

529
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,760
energy they're feeling

530
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:57,039
strengthened they are jacked

531
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,919
up and this could be fine for someone

532
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,240
who is strong who can drink coffee no

533
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,120
problem they can do a coffee enema and

534
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,559
not get really sick from it yet and they

535
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,039
can sit there and feel that Euphoria

536
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,600
from that adrenaline high but there's

537
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:14,360
somebody that actually has a

538
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,120
neurological symptom or condition or

539
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,679
problem they're hypers sensitive maybe

540
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,679
they have Panic issues and anxiety

541
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,240
issues they're going to be feeling

542
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,679
something different they're going to be

543
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,640
high on their adrenaline but their

544
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,720
nerves are going to start going on fire

545
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,480
and

546
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,279
overreacting and then there's the

547
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,440
coffee's harshness acidic nature a

548
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:42,080
stringent nature that's entering the

549
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,039
bloodstream that's aggravating the colon

550
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,320
in the small intestinal tract that was

551
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:49,000
never buffered ever cuz it's going up

552
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,880
through the rectum into the

553
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,080
colon and that toxic coffee is now

554
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,960
wreaking

555
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,200
havoc and it's heading to the liver it's

556
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,399
heading through the bloodstream it

557
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,960
shouldn't be entering the bloodstream

558
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:08,960
without digestion and proper time

559
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,679
release it wasn't Time released at all

560
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,000
it was just shot up there pumped up

561
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,360
there and then it just entered where it

562
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,720
was going to enter and this is not a

563
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,000
good thing people would say well it's

564
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,720
detoxifying it's going to cleanse and

565
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,679
detoxify my liver but here's the

566
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,640
interesting thing the liver does not

567
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,840
like to be forced for

568
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,640
detoxification the liver detoxifies when

569
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,440
it wants to detoxify when the

570
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:43,320
environment is right not being forced to

571
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,799
purge liver has an automatic shutdown

572
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,080
process it's to protect the liver so it

573
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,960
protects you so if there's a threat of

574
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:56,799
any kind the liver shuts down its over

575
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,000
2,000 chemical functions goes into low

576
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,679
battery and

577
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,120
underdrive goes dormant shuts down and

578
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,559
it stops doing what it needs to do and

579
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,679
there's no coffee that's going to

580
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,960
cleanse it there's no anything that's

581
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,039
going to cleanse it in that moment the

582
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,240
opposite happens to what people believe

583
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:19,960
happens when they put coffee up the back

584
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,720
end they think that it's detoxifying the

585
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,120
liver but the opposite occurs where the

586
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,760
liver shuts down and becomes more

587
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,159
toxic the liver becomes abused

588
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,080
and it's being forced to do something it

589
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:36,720
doesn't want to do meanwhile what you

590
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,279
see on social is all these influencers

591
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,840
now they're all into self-love and self-

592
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:46,000
goodness and positive love and making

593
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,840
sure they take care of themselves and

594
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,080
not push things too hard and make sure

595
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,480
things are balanced and they're all

596
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,720
going into coffee anemas and they're

597
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,559
beating the crap out of their own

598
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,720
livers and it's the direct opposite of

599
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,320
what they preach and say they do so

600
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,039
instead of taking care of themselves

601
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,840
like they preach and say they do out

602
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,159
there all the time they're looking for

603
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,559
that quick High the quick fix the trendy

604
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,679
thing and they're being tricked into

605
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,600
doing something that's damaging their

606
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:20,080
liver hurting their nervous systems

607
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,840
forcing their liver into

608
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,320
shutdown thinking that they're forcing

609
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,480
their liver into

610
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,919
detoxification they're not caring for

611
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,679
their body's properly kind of reminds me

612
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,279
of cold plunging everybody's just doing

613
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:37,480
cold plunging without realizing the cold

614
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,080
plunging can damage the central nervous

615
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,640
system with somebody who's hypers

616
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,080
sensitive depending on the temperatures

617
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,760
and how long and that leads to the next

618
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,000
thing everybody being a superhero or

619
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,840
wanting to be a hero or

620
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,279
superhuman where they'll do the coffee

621
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:00,919
enema much longer they'll try to hold in

622
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:03,279
the coffee longer or they'll cold plunge

623
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:06,039
and they'll cold Plunge in colder water

624
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,840
much longer and everybody wants to be a

625
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:11,679
show off and everybody wants to say hey

626
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,200
look at me look what I can do and

627
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,440
they're injuring

628
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,799
themselves and as they're doing this

629
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,600

body and the body saw it as a threat

647
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:18,279
unauthorized Rogue toxins coming from

00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:20,320
coffee being forced into the bloodstream

649
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:24,799
at an accelerated

650
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:27,000
rate unlawfully into the body so once

651
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,480
you pass being a beginner of coffee

652
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,360
enimas

653
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,720
you start going into that let me hold

654
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,399
the coffee in me longer let me get more

655
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,919
effects so what influencers will do now

656
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,519
they're trying to sell the whole coffee

657
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,240
enema approach they're trying to show

658
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:46,200
off and tell their crowds that they tend

659
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,279
to hold it in longer that they tend to

660
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,559
squeeze it in kind of squeeze their legs

661
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,919
and try to keep it inside their colon

662
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:56,440
and small intestinal tract try to push

663
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,519
it as far up as they can to get all the

664
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,200
detoxification effects possible but what

665
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:06,279
they don't realize is they're putting a

666
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:09,760
drastic strain on their own Hearts

667
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:12,279
they're endangering their own heart

668
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,200
which could lead to some people having a

669
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:18,480
heart attack and dying from coffee

670
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,960
Animas and this strain on the heart

671
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,880
causes an adrenaline release that

672
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,440
surpasses a smaller adrenaline release

673
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,679
or even a smaller one this is a large

674
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,480
extreme large adrenaline release the

675
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,320
longer you hold the coffee in the longer

676
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,720
that caffeine is going into the

677
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,399
bloodstream Without A Time release the

678
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,880
longer the liver is under attack and

679
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:46,679
shut down going dormant so it's

680
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,360
functions aren't even working the longer

681
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:52,159
the adrenals are releasing poison which

682
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,240
is adrenaline cuz it's fight or flight

683
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,919
the longer the brain has to sit there

684
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,519
receiving that adrenaline and that

685
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:01,279
caffeine

686
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,320
all of it happening at once while the

687
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,440
person's holding in the coffee longer

688
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,440
being a

689
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,120
showof showing their crowd this is the

690
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,360
best way to do your coffee enimas

691
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,880
meanwhile putting their crowd Their

692
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,919
audience into danger and during this

693
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,279
process as the liver shut down the

694
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:28,639
liver's preparing itself to go into high

695
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:31,440
gear to have to accelerate its function

696
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:34,240
which means it will not detox at all

697
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,960
because it has to work because it has to

698
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,039
collect and absorb and soak up all that

699
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,320
lethal damaging

700
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,760
adrenaline that's completely being

701
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,760
ejected out of the adrenals which by the

702
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,440
way ages the person faster and faster

703
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,880
and faster the more coffee enemas the

704
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,519
quicker somebody ages because they're

705
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,559
they're deet eting their adrenal

706
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,880
strength the same adrenal strength women

707
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:07,279
need for their pregnancies for birthing

708
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,800
children the same adrenal strength they

709
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,079
need for having sex the same adrenal

710
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,639
strength they need to exercise daily

711
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,639
they're depleting it they're destroying

712
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,280
their adrenals for the future and

713
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,079
they're aging themselves faster so when

714
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,159
they hit their 50s or 40s they're going

715
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:30,879
to look like they're in their 60s unlike

716
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:34,960
regular enimas which are much safer and

717
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:39,000
very safe in many ways coffee enimas

718
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,320
have a boomerang effect what happens is

719
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,879
poisons that are actually leaving the

720
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,119
liver naturally before the enema are

721
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,399
gathered back up by chemical compounds

722
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,480
released by the liver to protect the

723
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:55,560
brain and the heart and the kidneys the

724
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,760
liver has to start shutting down but

725
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,160
then when it goes back to work it's

726
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,280
collecting as much poisons and toxins in

727
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,320
the bloodstream as possible so nothing

728
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,280
leaves it collects them to protect your

729
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,599
brain and other organs it's a boomerang

730
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,880
effect it does the opposite you can't

731
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:19,400
force the liver to cleanse you can only

732
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,800
give your liver the necessary tools but

733
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,400
coffee enemas are not a tool for the

734
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,240
liver to cleanse it's the opposite it

735
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,920
shocks the liver into protecting

736
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,720
becoming a mama bear and protecting the

737
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,599
brain and other

738
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:39,000
organs the true definition to coffee

739
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:41,920
enema is robbing Peter to pay Paul and

740
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,839
that's what's happening it's stealing

741
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,280
precious adrenaline so the person can

742
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:51,800
become euphoric and feel high after the

743
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:54,880
coffee enim is done and then feel like

744
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:58,640
something good happened when in the end

745
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,880
they got high off of a Dr adrenaline

746
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,760
that was tomorrow's

747
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:08,960
adrenaline tomorrow's reserves to

748
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:13,640
protect you it was adrenaline stolen for

749
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:17,680
a quick high with a bad Trend adrenaline

750
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:21,640
borrowed for a rainy day now adrenaline

751
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,280
borrowed used up and thrown away what

752
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,200
most people will notice when they do a

753
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,920
coffee enema is accelerated heart rate

754
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,640
that accelerated heart rate is the

755
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,960
epinephrine the adrenaline being

756
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,760
released into the

757
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,720
bloodstream but keep in mind that that

758
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:41,000
accelerated heart rate puts pressure on

759
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:44,040
guess what the heart it puts the strain

760
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,160
on the heart now some people who do a

761
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,720
coffee enema will get the accelerated

762
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,440
heart rate right at the beginning right

763
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,760
at the start and it'll push all the way

764
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,200
through some people it's a little

765
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,359
delayed The Accelerated heart rate goes

766
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,680
up but it's not is noticeable but after

767
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,319
the coffee ena's done the accelerated

768
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,079
heart rate goes much higher at that

769
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:10,520
point it's euphoric it feels good it

770
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,400
feels like an accomplishment and when

771
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,520
you think you're releasing all these

772
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,280
toxins and you're helping your liver

773
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,800
it's kind of twofold it's like I just

774
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,240
did something really good for my liver I

775
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,599
just helped myself and I feel great I'm

776
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,960
going to recommend this for somebody

777
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,599
else to do but keep in mind if you're

778
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,920
going to do a coffee anema anyway and

779
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,800
even listening to this you say to

780
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,480
yourself I'm not going to listen to this

781
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,000
guy I'm going to do one because the

782
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,720
health professionals are saying it's

783
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,920
good the influencers are saying it's

784
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,440
good I want to try it then take this

785
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,319
information very seriously do not hold

786
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,839
it in long if you're going to do one no

787
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:55,520
matter what you got your own free will

788
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:58,520
and you're going to do it do not hold

789
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,640
the coffee in long term

790
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:05,079
quick in and a quick out do not hold it

791
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,640
in there you can get really sick I've

792
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:11,960
seen people out there and I know that

793
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,800
you can get very very ill and even

794
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,760
damage your own central nervous system

795
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,319
doing it and consecutively if you're

796
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,400
doing it often or you're doing it a lot

797
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:24,960
and at the beginning things are going

798
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,800
okay but by the 10th time or the 50th

799
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,280
time it's eventually going to bite you

800
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,960
on the ass

801
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,760
and you're going to be highly reactive

802
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,440
to a coffee enema where your whole body

803
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,640
is going to shake and go into

804
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,280
convulsions and Tremors and the bad part

805
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,680
about that is even when the coffee enema

806
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,760
is done those shakes and those

807
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,400
convulsions and those Tremors could

808
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,599
always be there at a hairline trigger

809
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,160
that means they're hovering from behind

810
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:55,880
and something else can trigger them easy

811
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,400
meanwhile the coffee enemas were truly

812
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,040
the thing that really pushed over the

813
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,760
edge and if you're somebody that feels

814
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,200
you were harmed by coffee enemas or you

815
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,720
knew it was hurting you at the time or

816
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,839
you're concerned about it look into

817
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,240
medical medium information ask your

818
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:16,680
doctor if it's right for you what you'll

819
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:19,040
find is it doesn't promote adrenaline to

820
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,599
just be pouring out everywhere it

821
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,920
doesn't promote aging it doesn't promote

822
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,680
caffeine instead it doesn't give you a

823
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,760
high it restores the body so you don't

824
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,240
need stimulants at some point in your

825
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,359
life down the road cuz a lot of people

826
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,319
they're on stimulants every day they're

827
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,920
looking for that adrenaline high and

828
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:41,680
they do trends like cold plunging or

829
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,520
coffee enas where they're getting this

830
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,920
excessive adrenaline rush and they feel

831
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,920
like it's moving them forward but in the

832
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,760
end it's hurting them because it's

833
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,680
putting the body in fight or flight

834
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,599
because the body thinks it's in danger

835
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,040
the brain thinks it's in danger now for

836
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,839
the ones that feel that I didn't maybe

837
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,480
give enough information on the cold

838
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,880
plunging claim that it's not good for us

839
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,920
keep in mind when you stick yourself in

840
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:15,560
ice water the body is under threat and

841
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,920
the brain is under threat and the body

842
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,280
is looking to protect itself so it's

843
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,160
releasing adrenaline to keep the brain

844
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,680
from freezing and that becomes an

845
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,040
adrenaline High which makes people feel

846
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,880
like whoa they're super human or they

847
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,760
get that rush like it's incredible and

848
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,480
cold plunging is not for everyone I was

849
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,440
the first person to put that information

850
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,280
out there and now influencers are just

851
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,040
starting to talk about that too because

852
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,160
they know that if you push it too far

853
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,920
you can get hurt and they know the

854
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,800
medical medium information has been

855
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,280
talking about that for quite a while out

856
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,359
there so but the coffee enema same thing

857
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,440
if you pushed yourself too far with it

858
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,280
or you've been involved with it know

859
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,440
that there's healing you can do rest

860
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:04,240
restorative healing that doesn't require

861
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,240
robbing Peter to pay

862
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,720
Paul feels so much

863
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,440
better that's that's feels so much

864
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,920
