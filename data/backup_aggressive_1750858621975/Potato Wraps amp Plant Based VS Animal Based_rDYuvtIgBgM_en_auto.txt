[0.56 - 6.24] we're live clubhouse facebook
[3.04 - 7.52] youtube we are live we're talking about
[6.24 - 10.56] plant-based versus
[7.52 - 13.44] animal based the ultimate battle
[10.56 - 14.72] out there it's what gets in the way of
[13.44 - 16.08] people healing
[14.72 - 18.64] are you plant-based if you're
[16.08 - 19.44] plant-based hey you know don't you're
[18.64 - 20.40] going to worry about all the
[19.44 - 21.68] animal-based people if you're
[20.40 - 23.28] animal-based you're going to worry about
[21.68 - 26.00] all the plant-based people right
[23.28 - 26.64] meaning hey look all the plant-based
[26.00 - 27.92] mamas
[26.64 - 29.68] they're all starving their little
[27.92 - 31.12] children they're starving their babies
[29.68 - 33.52] they're feeding them lettuce
[31.12 - 35.12] feeding them tomato and lettuce feeding
[33.52 - 36.64] them a little piece of fruit and they're
[35.12 - 38.96] starving a protein
[36.64 - 40.88] they get no protein right all the
[38.96 - 41.60] plant-based mommies are starving their
[40.88 - 45.84] children
[41.60 - 49.20] no protein no nutrition malabsorption
[45.84 - 52.40] all that bs that was told to
[49.20 - 54.08] so many plant-based moms right
[52.40 - 55.52] and then hey the vegans in the
[54.08 - 58.72] plant-based you know they're not
[55.52 - 59.76] innocent either okay you're killing all
[58.72 - 61.28] the animals
[59.76 - 63.44] you're killing you're destroying the
[61.28 - 64.24] animals the animals got souls which they
[63.44 - 66.32] do
[64.24 - 68.48] you're destroying the animals you're
[66.32 - 69.92] you're harming the environment
[68.48 - 71.52] you're you're you're creating the
[69.92 - 73.92] situation where
[71.52 - 75.20] you're knocking down the amazon to just
[73.92 - 78.00] raise cattle
[75.20 - 78.40] so we're losing our amazon we're losing

[81.20 - 86.00] planet right the forests
[83.36 - 86.40] um the jungles right we're losing all
[86.00 - 88.48] that

[176.72 - 180.72] are you guys which one are you guys you
[178.72 - 183.76] guys plant-based
[180.72 - 185.92] you guys vegan
[183.76 - 187.84] are you pescetarian are you vegetarian
[185.92 - 189.20] no one really cares about them anymore
[187.84 - 191.36] it's crazy right
[189.20 - 192.88] no one cares it's i've seen that out
[191.36 - 193.76] there too they've been phased out are
[192.88 - 196.84] you
[193.76 - 198.16] you macrobiotic like what are you right
[196.84 - 200.88] and
[198.16 - 202.64] it's all been phased out like it's crazy
[200.88 - 204.16] how it works but it's true
[202.64 - 206.24] really it's just animal protein it's
[204.16 - 208.00] just keto or plant-based
[206.24 - 209.52] or vegan right plant-based are vegan and
[208.00 - 210.56] the vegans in the plant-based they
[209.52 - 213.20] separated
[210.56 - 214.48] so they separated like everybody wants
[213.20 - 218.00] to belong i guess
[214.48 - 219.60] in some place right they want this
[218.00 - 221.76] belief system right
[219.60 - 223.52] they want a belief system you know the
[221.76 - 224.88] vegans are mad at the plant-based people
[223.52 - 226.88] i didn't even go there
[224.88 - 228.56] right but it's true because the
[226.88 - 229.28] plant-based people are still wearing
[228.56 - 230.72] leather
[229.28 - 232.48] right they're still they're still
[230.72 - 234.56] wearing leather shoes
[232.48 - 236.16] okay so then you got that little war
[234.56 - 237.04] going on too people like wait a minute
[236.16 - 239.76] are you vegan
[237.04 - 241.20] are you plant-based right we're totally
[239.76 - 243.04] censored today by the way
[241.20 - 244.72] right across right across the board
[243.04 - 246.96] we're really censored today
[244.72 - 248.00] um we can't even get anybody on today
[246.96 - 250.16] we're so censored
[248.00 - 252.96] so do you have this whole war that's
[250.16 - 254.80] happening with vegan and plant-based
[252.96 - 256.24] the plant-based vegan movement with each
[254.80 - 258.16] other right and then you got the
[256.24 - 259.84] animal-based movement
[258.16 - 262.40] the animal protein movement where the
[259.84 - 263.92] keto people they get all mad at the
[262.40 - 266.24] other people who are eating animal
[263.92 - 266.96] protein so the keto people get all mad
[266.24 - 269.36] at the other
[266.96 - 270.48] animal protein people you guys right on
[269.36 - 273.12] clubhouse you guys
[270.48 - 274.32] never notice that you guys and and
[273.12 - 276.08] youtube facebook
[274.32 - 277.76] and because there's a little bit of a
[276.08 - 281.36] war going on there
[277.76 - 284.40] okay the food wars right
[281.36 - 285.76] the plant versus animal wars right
[284.40 - 288.16] good to see you dr fong glad you're
[285.76 - 289.52] coming on yeah sorry about the sensory
[288.16 - 291.04] yeah no totally it's just been
[289.52 - 292.16] unbelievable lately it's just getting
[291.04 - 294.40] worse and worse
[292.16 - 295.44] so we got we got and who gets hurt the
[294.40 - 297.60] chronic leo
[295.44 - 298.64] i don't care about me but who gets hurt
[297.60 - 300.56] is the chronically ill getting
[298.64 - 303.36] information and everything else
[300.56 - 305.12] so but we got the keto people they're
[303.36 - 307.04] upset at the animal
[305.12 - 308.32] protein people because the animal
[307.04 - 311.60] protein people aren't
[308.32 - 314.80] adhering by the law by the law
[311.60 - 316.48] of the keto people law right
[314.80 - 318.08] because wait a minute you're either keto
[316.48 - 319.60] or you're just eating you know regular
[318.08 - 321.04] animal protein and then they
[319.60 - 322.96] start saying maybe you're on a standard
[321.04 - 324.08] american diet and people like no i'm not
[322.96 - 326.48] it's not a standard american
[324.08 - 327.52] diet i'm not doing processed foods i'm
[326.48 - 329.68] not doing you know
[327.52 - 331.92] processed foods i'm not doing fast foods
[329.68 - 334.56] i'm not doing fried greasy foods
[331.92 - 335.28] but i'm i i guess i'm not all the way
[334.56 - 337.92] keto
[335.28 - 338.64] so what am i so but i'm eating clean
[337.92 - 340.48] right
[338.64 - 341.92] so the keto people are yelling at the
[340.48 - 343.60] people who are eating clean people that
[341.92 - 345.20] are eating like clean diets or yelling
[343.60 - 346.48] at the keto people
[345.20 - 347.76] and you've got the vegans yelling at the
[346.48 - 349.84] plant-based and plant-based yelling at
[347.76 - 351.60] the vegans and then the pescetarians
[349.84 - 353.84] they're just kind of like out there like
[351.60 - 356.16] you know they're sitting out there
[353.84 - 357.28] somewhere on some island right
[356.16 - 358.72] pescetarians
[357.28 - 360.96] you think about that or the vegetarians
[358.72 - 362.96] who even talks about vegetarians anymore
[360.96 - 364.88] i mean it's like it's that's a whole
[362.96 - 367.12] nother thing all in its own it's
[364.88 - 368.72] you know uh be open-hearted hey good
[367.12 - 370.88] glad you're on
[368.72 - 371.92] good to see you um so glad you guys are
[370.88 - 375.60] coming on and
[371.92 - 378.64] this is an important talk because you
[375.60 - 382.40] take your eye off the ball
[378.64 - 386.64] when you're fighting for something
[382.40 - 389.12] that isn't really got your back
[386.64 - 390.96] you're taking your eye off the ball i'm
[389.12 - 394.32] so busy fighting
[390.96 - 395.68] i'm so busy being a staunch plant-based
[394.32 - 397.52] person nothing wrong with that if your
[395.68 - 399.28] plant-based stay plant-based
[397.52 - 400.80] if your animal protein staple animal
[399.28 - 403.68] protein it's fine right
[400.80 - 405.68] lunelle good to see it's so but but what
[403.68 - 406.80] happens is we get wrapped up into the
[405.68 - 409.28] battle
[406.80 - 410.48] it's the battle right so i'm plant-based
[409.28 - 411.20] i'm gonna follow all the plant-based
[410.48 - 412.80] people right
[411.20 - 414.40] i'm gonna follow the plant-based people
[412.80 - 416.40] if i'm animal-based i'm gonna follow all
[414.40 - 420.24] the animal-based people right
[416.40 - 422.08] but everyone gets sick everyone gets
[420.24 - 424.00] sick michelle l says we have to keep the
[422.08 - 424.88] eye on the ball our eye on the ball
[424.00 - 428.88] right
[424.88 - 430.56] yeah um so we're vegan saying we cannot
[428.88 - 433.68] be vegan because we consume
[430.56 - 435.36] honey uh it is called healing
[433.68 - 437.28] people right that's another thing too
[435.36 - 440.00] with the honey yeah first of all
[437.28 - 440.72] honey is vegan honey is plant-based
[440.00 - 443.28] right
[440.72 - 444.40] a bee is an insect really important to
[443.28 - 448.32] know right there
[444.40 - 451.52] a bee is not an animal so someone missed
[448.32 - 455.52] the memo on that whole thing okay
[451.52 - 457.52] so and and the b doesn't get hurt
[455.52 - 459.84] so the b doesn't get hurt through that
[457.52 - 460.96] process okay so that's important to know
[459.84 - 464.32] right there
[460.96 - 467.44] right and these bees have been here for
[464.32 - 468.40] forever on this planet thousands of
[467.44 - 471.76] years
[468.40 - 475.12] right providing a source
[471.76 - 478.08] for animals and humankind you know
[475.12 - 479.60] but you know i if someone says well what
[478.08 - 481.28] does anthony williams think
[479.60 - 483.28] can you be vegan and still have honey
[481.28 - 484.08] yeah i do i know that's gonna get people
[483.28 - 485.52] mad
[484.08 - 487.28] because then all of a sudden the vegans
[485.52 - 488.72] are gonna be mad at me now oh he's he
[487.28 - 491.76] doesn't know he's not
[488.72 - 494.32] he's not woke on that whole thing like
[491.76 - 496.16] aws not woke about that you know he's
[494.32 - 496.88] off the mark and if he's off the mark on
[496.16 - 498.32] the honey thing
[496.88 - 500.40] i'm not gonna listen to anything the guy
[498.32 - 501.52] has to talk about i'm not gonna listen
[500.40 - 503.20] to anything meanwhile
[501.52 - 505.44] you know they're doing medical medium
[503.20 - 507.84] information tidbits that got into
[505.44 - 508.56] all the different diet beliefs out there
[507.84 - 511.52] right
[508.56 - 511.92] that because the keto belief system is
[511.52 - 514.56] now
[511.92 - 516.08] surviving because it's it's adhering to
[514.56 - 517.20] medical medium stuff that's how it's
[516.08 - 519.36] even surviving
[517.20 - 520.88] because in the old days you went keto
[519.36 - 523.76] you got sick
[520.88 - 525.84] real sick keto now was in keto by the
[523.76 - 527.44] way i want to cover that for a second
[525.84 - 529.44] before i make these potato wraps these
[527.44 - 532.56] killer potato wrap salad wraps
[529.44 - 535.92] um but keto is in keto anymore
[532.56 - 538.96] that's it okay you eat a tomato
[535.92 - 540.48] you eat a tomato okay on a keto diet you
[538.96 - 542.40] can't go into ketosis
[540.48 - 544.40] there's too much sugar in it there's
[542.40 - 546.96] sugar in the tomato you there's glucose
[544.40 - 549.60] in tomato you can't go into keto
[546.96 - 550.24] you can't go into ketosis you can't go
[549.60 - 552.72] your body
[550.24 - 554.16] can't evolve to that process it can't
[552.72 - 557.44] make that process happen
[554.16 - 558.88] you eat an avocado as somebody on a keto
[557.44 - 562.40] diet
[558.88 - 564.00] and you can't go into ketosis it's not a
[562.40 - 565.76] keto diet anymore
[564.00 - 567.52] i mean when you really think about how
[565.76 - 568.40] much confusion is in the diet world it's
[567.52 - 570.00] unbelievable
[568.40 - 572.80] minis are good to see it tonight you
[570.00 - 574.80] know it's when you think about that
[572.80 - 576.72] how does that work if you're eating an
[574.80 - 578.00] avocado which is filled with sugar
[576.72 - 580.72] should you guys know that you know that
[578.00 - 584.00] avocado has glucose in it it's a fruit
[580.72 - 586.64] it's not 100 fat fruit
[584.00 - 588.32] avocados not it's got some sugar in it
[586.64 - 590.56] it's got glucose in it
[588.32 - 592.64] you can't go into ketosis so i'm on a
[590.56 - 594.48] keto diet i'm doing my avocados no
[592.64 - 597.36] you're not on a keto diet you're on
[594.48 - 598.24] what people think is a keto diet but
[597.36 - 600.72] it's not
[598.24 - 602.64] it's not because it's got the sugar in
[600.72 - 606.00] it i'm on a keto diet i'm doing
[602.64 - 608.16] i'm doing uh almond butter there's sugar
[606.00 - 610.32] in nuts and seeds
[608.16 - 613.44] you can't go into ketosis because
[610.32 - 615.60] there's sugar in nuts and seeds you guys
[613.44 - 616.96] this is powerful information this is how
[615.60 - 618.88] you empower yourself
[616.96 - 620.48] by knowing where you're being tricked
[618.88 - 623.04] and duped your whole life
[620.48 - 623.60] you know what you know what if you guys
[623.04 - 626.08] want
[623.60 - 627.52] look i'm not against it if you guys want
[626.08 - 629.52] to be tricked your whole life
[627.52 - 630.56] if you want to live your life in some
[629.52 - 634.64] weird
[630.56 - 637.84] phantom world of misinformation but just
[634.64 - 639.60] living by misinformation your whole life
[637.84 - 642.08] i thought our lives are really important
[639.60 - 644.96] where missing why would you want
[642.08 - 647.36] to be stopped up and soaked with
[644.96 - 650.48] misinformation your whole life
[647.36 - 652.48] and not have the truth and the answers
[650.48 - 654.64] isn't your life important don't you live
[652.48 - 657.12] by your truth you live by your truth
[654.64 - 658.40] right yeah but that's that's where they
[657.12 - 660.80] trick you in alternative medicine
[658.40 - 664.48] conventional medicine you get tricked
[660.80 - 666.16] right because it's someone should just
[664.48 - 670.24] all of a sudden be like uh
[666.16 - 671.36] hey um everybody um it's not the keto
[670.24 - 674.80] diet
[671.36 - 678.08] it's just now a clean diet
[674.80 - 679.84] you can be plant-based keto you can be
[678.08 - 682.80] animal-based keto
[679.84 - 685.28] but they're not keto the word doesn't
[682.80 - 688.08] even apply anymore
[685.28 - 690.16] that's how it works the only way to go
[688.08 - 693.36] into ketosis
[690.16 - 696.48] is literally just maybe doing animal
[693.36 - 700.56] protein by itself and never
[696.48 - 705.04] having any glucose no lemon no avocado
[700.56 - 707.12] no tomato no starchy vegetable
[705.04 - 709.44] not nothing right you just you're doing
[707.12 - 711.52] just animal protein so you end up
[709.44 - 712.56] and there's still glucose in meat but
[711.52 - 715.36] you have a better
[712.56 - 716.08] chance of heading into you know
[715.36 - 719.52] ketogenic
[716.08 - 719.84] state right you have a better chance of
[719.52 - 722.24] of
[719.84 - 724.40] reaching that keto ketogenic state right
[722.24 - 725.20] especially if you're not eating a lot of
[724.40 - 727.68] meat so
[725.20 - 729.12] say you don't eat a lot of meat like say
[727.68 - 731.76] you're a carnivore person
[729.12 - 733.84] and you're not eating dairy and you're
[731.76 - 735.04] not you're and you're just eating some
[733.84 - 737.20] meat
[735.04 - 738.24] you can go into ketosis if it's not a
[737.20 - 739.84] lot of meat because if you're starting
[738.24 - 740.64] to do a lot of meat there's sugar in the
[739.84 - 742.96] blood
[740.64 - 744.24] the blood of the animal their sugar it
[742.96 - 745.92] caramelizes
[744.24 - 748.16] it's in the it's in the meat it
[745.92 - 749.04] caramelizes right so what happens is you
[748.16 - 751.52] guys
[749.04 - 753.12] when you eat a little bit of meat and
[751.52 - 754.08] only a little bit of meat that's when
[753.12 - 755.92] you go and take
[754.08 - 757.20] you know into ketosis that's when you
[755.92 - 759.20] can do it
[757.20 - 760.72] but why doesn't anybody straighten out
[759.20 - 763.28] all this misinformation
[760.72 - 764.40] why is the world it's like the matrix or
[763.28 - 767.08] something right
[764.40 - 768.24] just everybody living this phantom
[767.08 - 771.04] misinformation
[768.24 - 772.24] place and nothing gets fixed and nothing
[771.04 - 774.16] gets corrected
[772.24 - 775.68] you can have all these fancy tv shows
[774.16 - 777.20] you can have all this information on the
[775.68 - 778.00] internet you can have all these articles
[777.20 - 779.76] on the internet
[778.00 - 781.92] you can have all these interviews all
[779.76 - 783.04] these podcast doctors and nothing is
[781.92 - 786.16] correct
[783.04 - 788.48] nothing gets fixed it's almost like
[786.16 - 789.68] it's it's yeah it's the matrix that's
[788.48 - 791.36] what it is
[789.68 - 793.44] in in natural health and conventional
[791.36 - 796.96] health right
[793.44 - 799.20] so um so paula torres says this is
[796.96 - 800.16] nonsense i was vegetarian for 20 years
[799.20 - 803.20] and it was
[800.16 - 804.80] the worst thing for my body try am i
[803.20 - 807.52] telling you to be vegetarian
[804.80 - 809.04] i'm confused tried medical medium 2 it's
[807.52 - 811.92] nonsense
[809.04 - 813.44] at the bottom what affects everything is
[811.92 - 817.60] genetics
[813.44 - 819.68] read gene keys so okay so paula
[817.60 - 821.20] so you just think our genes went all bad
[819.68 - 823.68] in the last 20 years
[821.20 - 824.32] our jeans went all bad in the last 25
[823.68 - 827.28] years
[824.32 - 828.80] so everything was going fine and now we
[827.28 - 830.80] got the worst chronic illness ever
[828.80 - 831.36] before in the history of humankind right
[830.80 - 833.28] now
[831.36 - 834.80] and i guess your genes all went bad in
[833.28 - 836.24] the last 20 years so that's what you're
[834.80 - 838.08] chalking it off to be
[836.24 - 840.16] just so you know the whole it's your
[838.08 - 842.00] genes comes from a theory that it's your
[840.16 - 845.04] body attacking itself did you know that
[842.00 - 847.04] like it's cause unknown do you know why
[845.04 - 849.12] they came up with the word genes
[847.04 - 851.52] do you know why the gene theory now
[849.12 - 854.80] paula remember this it's called the gene
[851.52 - 858.00] theory it's inconclusive
[854.80 - 860.80] there's no facts there's no study that
[858.00 - 861.12] proves it's your genes it's inconclusive
[860.80 - 863.76] so
[861.12 - 864.24] here you are already you're sitting here
[863.76 - 866.64] you're
[864.24 - 867.60] you're spouting out inconclusive stuff
[866.64 - 870.32] like cause
[867.60 - 870.72] unknown so they just say it's genes
[870.32 - 872.24] right
[870.72 - 873.92] but you might not be able to handle this
[872.24 - 875.44] truth so paula
[873.92 - 877.84] you might not be able to handle this
[875.44 - 878.80] truth and i'm kind of wondering what mm
[877.84 - 879.92] did you try
[878.80 - 881.68] because there's a thousand different
[879.92 - 882.56] protocols to customize for everybody's
[881.68 - 884.56] problems
[882.56 - 885.76] for people who are animal protein people
[884.56 - 888.32] who are plant-based
[885.76 - 889.68] people who are anything it's there for
[888.32 - 891.44] you to heal
[889.68 - 892.80] so i'm starting to scratch my head right
[891.44 - 896.08] now paul and i'm wondering
[892.80 - 898.80] what were you doing because huh um
[896.08 - 899.12] yeah well the phone's ringing too so i

[1052.80 - 1057.20] medical medium protocols right and did
[1054.80 - 1059.28] they do the 369 cleanse over and over
[1057.20 - 1061.04] again to get out of that place of health
[1059.28 - 1063.28] so they can heal
[1061.04 - 1065.04] and did they do 64 ounces of celery

[1146.56 - 1150.80] own detectives i really really got to a
[1150.32 - 1154.08] point
[1150.80 - 1156.40] in the la the last 30 years especially
[1154.08 - 1158.00] with social media recently when someone
[1156.40 - 1160.08] says i tried on them and it didn't work
[1158.00 - 1163.12] because that i'm scratching my head
[1160.08 - 1164.48] really you tried mm because did you do

[1164.48 - 1166.88] supplements in the book like all the
[1166.08 - 1168.40] doses
[1166.88 - 1171.76] did you use the stuff that was all
[1168.40 - 1175.28] friendly instead of stuff that's toxic
[1171.76 - 1177.04] right how long did you do it what also
[1175.28 - 1177.60] what else are you doing and mixing in in
[1177.04 - 1178.80] there

[1180.80 - 1183.76] pizza on friday nights right
[1182.48 - 1185.20] are you doing that because that's
[1183.76 - 1186.40] another one right there that's a head
[1185.20 - 1188.96] scratch roll on its own
[1186.40 - 1190.88] is the pizza happening on friday night
[1188.96 - 1192.64] is it happening on saturday night
[1190.88 - 1194.08] what about eggs you didn't have any eggs

[1196.48 - 1200.96] anybody
[1197.76 - 1202.00] it's just that if you want to go all the
[1200.96 - 1205.20] way
[1202.00 - 1207.76] don't throw mmm under the bus
[1205.20 - 1209.28] because you didn't do your homework
[1207.76 - 1210.08] don't throw a medical medium under the
[1209.28 - 1211.92] bus
[1210.08 - 1213.92] so that 10 other people say oh that
[1211.92 - 1215.44] person tried mm i better not ever try it
[1213.92 - 1215.76] so let me just stay sick the rest of my
[1215.44 - 1217.36] life
[1215.76 - 1220.08] because you'll send somebody else
[1217.36 - 1221.92] packing and that person packing
[1220.08 - 1224.24] up their belongings and going on the
[1221.92 - 1225.20] road going on the road to musical chairs
[1224.24 - 1226.64] and guessing games
[1225.20 - 1228.32] you'll send them on that road for the
[1226.64 - 1230.48] next five years
[1228.32 - 1231.84] because they got thrown because they
[1230.48 - 1234.48] believed
[1231.84 - 1235.36] you were doing a real medical medium
[1234.48 - 1237.60] protocol
[1235.36 - 1238.64] doing it right doing it the way you
[1237.60 - 1241.12] needed to do it
[1238.64 - 1242.40] and then you just sent somebody on their
[1241.12 - 1244.56] way
[1242.40 - 1245.68] see you later alligator you've been sick
[1244.56 - 1248.16] for another four five
[1245.68 - 1250.08] six seven years before you learn what
[1248.16 - 1250.72] viruses are causing your problems with
[1250.08 - 1252.32] bacteria
[1250.72 - 1254.16] causing your problems about the toxic
[1252.32 - 1255.20] heavy metals about all the things to
[1254.16 - 1257.28] avoid
[1255.20 - 1258.96] and then you learn i should have been
[1257.28 - 1260.32] doing the heavy metal detox smoothie
[1258.96 - 1261.84] long enough i should have been doing the
[1260.32 - 1263.44] celery juice a little bit long enough i
[1261.84 - 1265.04] should have been doing spinach soups
[1263.44 - 1266.48] i should have done the anti-radiation
[1265.04 - 1267.76] tea i should have done the things that i
[1266.48 - 1269.52] needed to do
[1267.76 - 1271.04] i should have done use the right
[1269.52 - 1273.52] ingredients and not
[1271.04 - 1275.36] hpp i should have picked a celery juice
[1273.52 - 1276.96] that was freshly juiced and not
[1275.36 - 1278.80] high pressure pasteurization because you
[1276.96 - 1282.48] can't get batter from that
[1278.80 - 1283.20] right so i'm i'm just giving you the low
[1282.48 - 1286.08] down
[1283.20 - 1286.96] of how it works so i actually giving
[1286.08 - 1288.72] good to see
[1286.96 - 1291.12] i'm scratching my head when i hear that
[1288.72 - 1293.76] one that's a funny one to me
[1291.12 - 1294.48] so um you guys we're making food we
[1293.76 - 1296.16] gotta do this
[1294.48 - 1298.16] we're talking about plant-based versus
[1296.16 - 1300.80] animal-based
[1298.16 - 1302.80] this is a really incredibly important
[1300.80 - 1305.60] topic because you can get wrapped
[1302.80 - 1308.00] up in the belief systems and lose your
[1305.60 - 1310.56] chance to heal
[1308.00 - 1311.36] i believe in plant-based i believe in
[1310.56 - 1313.52] vegan
[1311.36 - 1315.76] i believe in animal protein if someone
[1313.52 - 1318.40] wants to be on animal protein okay
[1315.76 - 1320.16] because i've come i've come from a place
[1318.40 - 1324.48] where spirit of compassion
[1320.16 - 1326.96] has told me that it's not the person's
[1324.48 - 1328.08] fault wherever they are spiritually
[1326.96 - 1331.04] right
[1328.08 - 1332.00] it's not the person's fault if they make
[1331.04 - 1335.04] mistakes
[1332.00 - 1338.48] right it's not the person's fault
[1335.04 - 1342.00] of why they're even sick we have to not
[1338.48 - 1344.48] pull the blame game on the person
[1342.00 - 1346.48] we instead have to give the people the
[1344.48 - 1348.00] tools and the truth
[1346.48 - 1349.44] and then when they have that in their
[1348.00 - 1351.44] hands they have a chance to heal and
[1349.44 - 1355.92] move forward let's start making this
[1351.44 - 1359.04] i'm excited you guys so
[1355.92 - 1360.88] and basically it's about having a choice
[1359.04 - 1362.96] i mean don't you guys want a choice
[1360.88 - 1364.48] it's about having a choice you want to
[1362.96 - 1367.52] be able to
[1364.48 - 1369.20] be able to make that choice to
[1367.52 - 1371.60] make a decision so listen if you're
[1369.20 - 1374.96] animal protein you got to do it right
[1371.60 - 1376.40] to why you're sick if you're plant based
[1374.96 - 1379.12] if you're vegan you've got to do it
[1376.40 - 1380.80] right to why you're sick
[1379.12 - 1382.48] knowing why you're sick is part of you
[1380.80 - 1383.28] guys on clubhouse knowing why you're
[1382.48 - 1385.76] sick
[1383.28 - 1386.72] is part of it it's a big part of it then
[1385.76 - 1388.56] knowing what to do
[1386.72 - 1389.92] the tools and how to do it is the other
[1388.56 - 1392.16] part of it right
[1389.92 - 1394.08] same thing you guys on facebook and uh
[1392.16 - 1395.92] youtube you guys i got some steamed
[1394.08 - 1397.28] potatoes right here
[1395.92 - 1399.92] in this bowl i don't know if you can see
[1397.28 - 1402.00] that is the lighting any better
[1399.92 - 1403.92] i know that someone's like the lighting
[1402.00 - 1405.12] i thought lighting was good today i was
[1403.92 - 1405.44] checking it out it's like you know what
[1405.12 - 1407.76] this
[1405.44 - 1409.04] this lighting looks good for today i
[1407.76 - 1412.16] think we might be able to see
[1409.04 - 1413.20] better um i'm putting some potatoes in
[1412.16 - 1416.80] here
[1413.20 - 1420.24] so i'm making these potato like um
[1416.80 - 1422.48] wraps right and let's see if i can do a
[1420.24 - 1425.60] good job at it i really don't know
[1422.48 - 1429.36] you know you guys know
[1425.60 - 1430.08] how it works we're live this isn't a
[1429.36 - 1432.72] studio
[1430.08 - 1434.48] performance pre-recorded where
[1432.72 - 1436.16] everything's perfect and you clip and
[1434.48 - 1437.28] edit and then you redo it if something
[1436.16 - 1439.12] didn't go right
[1437.28 - 1440.64] i slap the stuff together and we just
[1439.12 - 1443.60] pray
[1440.64 - 1444.32] we just pray it's gonna go it's gonna go
[1443.60 - 1447.92] good
[1444.32 - 1451.20] um good to see you guys coming on
[1447.92 - 1452.64] so i'm actually i got some potatoes in
[1451.20 - 1454.56] here
[1452.64 - 1456.48] i'm gonna put some maple syrup two
[1454.56 - 1459.68] teaspoons of maple syrup in here
[1456.48 - 1461.92] okay there we go
[1459.68 - 1463.12] got two teaspoons of maple syrup which
[1461.92 - 1466.24] is fun
[1463.12 - 1468.56] right you have a little bit of garlic
[1466.24 - 1471.60] powder in here too
[1468.56 - 1475.04] can you guys see this yet
[1471.60 - 1476.00] and a little bit of onion powder in here
[1475.04 - 1478.24] as well
[1476.00 - 1478.24] right
[1479.84 - 1487.12] okay i'm gonna
[1482.96 - 1490.80] give this a whirl
[1487.12 - 1492.88] so let's do that all right i think i got
[1490.80 - 1492.88] it
[1494.88 - 1501.84] this is like making batter it's like
[1496.96 - 1501.84] making a batter you know
[1505.36 - 1508.40] i'm going to give it a pulse
[1513.52 - 1517.04] one thing that we have whether you're
[1515.20 - 1520.24] vegan or your animal protein there's a
[1517.04 - 1522.72] serious emotional attachment to food
[1520.24 - 1524.16] we have emotional attachments to food
[1522.72 - 1525.92] this is something we all
[1524.16 - 1528.08] battle and if you've ever heard somebody
[1525.92 - 1530.16] say i don't think about food i don't
[1528.08 - 1533.52] have any emotional attachments to food
[1530.16 - 1534.08] i live my life i'm i'm all about living
[1533.52 - 1536.72] life
[1534.08 - 1538.16] not living for eating you know i live
[1536.72 - 1540.48] for living
[1538.16 - 1542.40] i don't live to eat right there's people
[1540.48 - 1546.56] out there they'll say that and
[1542.40 - 1548.40] um just so you know they're really just
[1546.56 - 1550.24] they're really they're really not
[1548.40 - 1551.44] totally honest or they're completely
[1550.24 - 1553.60] unaware
[1551.44 - 1557.84] of really what's happening because
[1553.60 - 1557.84] everybody thinks about food
[1564.16 - 1568.16] if you took away the food they like to
[1566.16 - 1569.04] eat they would freak out like you never
[1568.16 - 1570.40] would believe
[1569.04 - 1572.08] right so there's people that are like
[1570.40 - 1574.48] you know i eat when i'm hungry
[1572.08 - 1575.76] i don't think about it it doesn't matter
[1574.48 - 1579.12] i'm not thinking i'm not
[1575.76 - 1581.68] thinking about um i'm not thinking about
[1579.12 - 1583.68] what i'm eating i'm not it doesn't
[1581.68 - 1585.52] matter i just live my life you guys all

[1588.72 - 1591.12] your food you're worried about what
[1589.92 - 1592.72] you're eating you're worried about what
[1591.12 - 1594.48] you're putting in your mouth
[1592.72 - 1596.24] you're worried about how like every
[1594.48 - 1598.32] minute is about food right
[1596.24 - 1599.84] they'll make you feel that way they'll
[1598.32 - 1600.48] make you feel that way they'll make you
[1599.84 - 1603.04] feel
[1600.48 - 1604.24] like you're just all consumed you got
[1603.04 - 1606.80] the eating disorder
[1604.24 - 1607.52] you guys got the eating disorder it's
[1606.80 - 1610.00] you guys
[1607.52 - 1612.08] all you guys that care about your food
[1610.00 - 1613.76] right you're orthorexic you got eating
[1612.08 - 1615.28] disorders you're worried about food
[1613.76 - 1616.88] every second
[1615.28 - 1618.96] we're living our life we ain't worried
[1616.88 - 1619.76] about food one bit no one's worried
[1618.96 - 1621.12] about food
[1619.76 - 1622.64] we're living our life we're doing what
[1621.12 - 1624.40] we want to do i'm just moving this
[1622.64 - 1625.28] around it's almost done just give it one
[1624.40 - 1627.44] quick whirl
[1625.28 - 1629.04] and the casino don't buy into that
[1627.44 - 1631.20] that's a trick
[1629.04 - 1633.52] to trick on social media too that's an
[1631.20 - 1636.88] actual trick
[1633.52 - 1638.16] that's to make someone that's to make
[1636.88 - 1640.56] someone this is done that's
[1638.16 - 1642.40] to make someone feel like they got
[1640.56 - 1645.04] something over you
[1642.40 - 1647.04] right you're out of control you're not
[1645.04 - 1648.40] in control they're in control they're in
[1647.04 - 1650.08] control of their emotions they're in
[1648.40 - 1652.32] control of what they're eating
[1650.08 - 1654.40] they're just living their life right you
[1652.32 - 1656.16] know that's the vibe they put out right
[1654.40 - 1658.00] you're the one that's a mess
[1656.16 - 1659.92] you have to go to the health food store
[1658.00 - 1661.52] you have to get the right food you got
[1659.92 - 1663.68] to get the right everything
[1661.52 - 1664.96] you're worried about your healing you're
[1663.68 - 1666.56] worried about all this and
[1664.96 - 1668.24] that's a game being played and you'll
[1666.56 - 1669.92] play you'll see that out there
[1668.24 - 1671.68] so you see some people they act like
[1669.92 - 1673.60] they got it all together on youtube or
[1671.68 - 1676.32] somewhere else and it's like this is how
[1673.60 - 1678.32] this is what i eat and um and i really
[1676.32 - 1680.16] don't care what i eat i just eat when i
[1678.32 - 1680.64] feel like it and they pull that thing
[1680.16 - 1682.32] and
[1680.64 - 1684.56] that's a trick right there just letting
[1682.32 - 1687.12] you guys know and it's a good trick too
[1684.56 - 1690.40] because it can get you it can get you
[1687.12 - 1692.80] believing that for some reason you're
[1690.40 - 1695.12] you know you're the one that is like
[1692.80 - 1697.36] worried about your food every minute
[1695.12 - 1698.64] whether you're keto or your or your
[1697.36 - 1701.20] plant-based
[1698.64 - 1701.84] that's another trick that's happening
[1701.20 - 1703.36] out there
[1701.84 - 1705.44] so i'm gonna make a couple of these this
[1703.36 - 1706.32] is like a batter right this is the maple
[1705.44 - 1708.72] syrup
[1706.32 - 1710.16] and the potato the steamed potato but i
[1708.72 - 1712.88] gave it a blend
[1710.16 - 1714.16] um and so i'm going to throw this in the
[1712.88 - 1715.92] oven in a little bit but first i'm going
[1714.16 - 1717.76] to prepare a couple of them
[1715.92 - 1719.76] we've got lots to talk about while we're
[1717.76 - 1722.72] doing this so
[1719.76 - 1723.76] just bear with me let's get some of this
[1722.72 - 1725.76] batter out
[1723.76 - 1727.76] and the batter is just steamed potato so
[1725.76 - 1730.40] we're not using a batter right
[1727.76 - 1731.28] now why do i like recipes like this you
[1730.40 - 1734.32] guys
[1731.28 - 1735.60] because first of all there's no gluten
[1734.32 - 1739.76] in here
[1735.60 - 1740.96] right gluten feeds the bugs inside of us
[1739.76 - 1744.64] you're sick
[1740.96 - 1746.40] you're sick right and
[1744.64 - 1748.00] if you're sick with anything there's
[1746.40 - 1750.64] some buggies going on
[1748.00 - 1752.24] there's some buggies at hand yep there's
[1750.64 - 1754.48] some buggies at work
[1752.24 - 1756.64] okay just giving you the 4-1-1 right
[1754.48 - 1758.32] there if you're if you got a problem you
[1756.64 - 1760.00] got a complaint you're at the doctor's
[1758.32 - 1764.72] office
[1760.00 - 1769.04] there's some buggies going on right
[1764.72 - 1770.48] keep that in mind that's how it works
[1769.04 - 1772.16] so first of all i'm just going to make
[1770.48 - 1775.20] this tortilla right here
[1772.16 - 1778.00] um let's see how that works here so what
[1775.20 - 1778.00] i'm going to do is
[1778.88 - 1782.48] i'm going to make a wrap and this wrap
[1781.28 - 1786.00] is going to be
[1782.48 - 1786.00] this wrap is going to be um
[1786.96 - 1792.84] you got to keep the spoon kind of moist
[1790.32 - 1795.92] so i'm going to just do this a little
[1792.84 - 1798.24] bit and i'm making a potato
[1795.92 - 1800.56] apparently potato pizza you can call it
[1798.24 - 1801.84] a potato wrap you can call it a potato
[1800.56 - 1804.96] pizza right
[1801.84 - 1808.48] that's what i'm doing here and i'm just
[1804.96 - 1810.08] gonna flatten this out a little bit
[1808.48 - 1812.56] i'm going to try to get some shape to it
[1810.08 - 1816.00] if i can
[1812.56 - 1818.24] god willing there we go
[1816.00 - 1819.68] kind of can shape it a little bit right
[1818.24 - 1823.20] and then flatten it out more
[1819.68 - 1826.48] you don't want it so thick
[1823.20 - 1827.28] right you don't want it so thick but you
[1826.48 - 1830.32] don't want it
[1827.28 - 1832.96] so thin so there's this there's this you
[1830.32 - 1836.00] know way you can have this right
[1832.96 - 1839.84] i got the oven preset it's preheating
[1836.00 - 1845.36] right now roughly around
[1839.84 - 1845.36] 400 i got a little lump right there
[1847.60 - 1853.12] it's 200 celsius right
[1850.72 - 1853.12] i think
[1853.84 - 1857.36] all right there we go so this is one
[1855.52 - 1860.40] wrap that's coming together nice
[1857.36 - 1860.40] let's make another one
[1861.84 - 1866.32] i want i don't want anybody left out of
[1863.76 - 1868.32] the whole keto thing i wasn't ranking on
[1866.32 - 1871.12] keto that's not what i'm doing i'm just
[1868.32 - 1873.52] telling people you guys aren't on keto
[1871.12 - 1875.68] you're not going into ketosis it's not
[1873.52 - 1877.04] possible you guys got carbs in there and
[1875.68 - 1879.20] you don't know it
[1877.04 - 1880.48] but no one's fixing that like no one
[1879.20 - 1883.60] corrects anything
[1880.48 - 1885.12] right details matter and hey hey
[1883.60 - 1887.04] maybe the details don't matter so much
[1885.12 - 1889.04] if you're not sick
[1887.04 - 1890.24] right maybe it doesn't matter so much
[1889.04 - 1893.76] just live your life right
[1890.24 - 1896.68] you're not sick but when you're sick
[1893.76 - 1898.08] if you're sick those details mean
[1896.68 - 1901.36] everything
[1898.08 - 1903.52] that's make or break that's you're gonna
[1901.36 - 1905.60] that's gonna be the point of like are
[1903.52 - 1908.88] you gonna heal or not
[1905.60 - 1911.92] do or die right
[1908.88 - 1914.88] thrive or or not thrive
[1911.92 - 1915.60] that's what matters the details make a
[1914.88 - 1917.84] difference on
[1915.60 - 1919.12] all of that think about that a little
[1917.84 - 1922.32] bit right
[1919.12 - 1923.84] every little bit counts when it comes
[1922.32 - 1925.68] down to healing
[1923.84 - 1927.20] so i'm going to add a little bit more
[1925.68 - 1930.16] i'm making another shell
[1927.20 - 1932.00] or another potato crust for this right
[1930.16 - 1934.56] put a couple teaspoons of maple syrup in
[1932.00 - 1936.24] here this is going to be really good
[1934.56 - 1939.52] put a little garlic powder a little
[1936.24 - 1939.52] onion powder in here right
[1940.32 - 1945.04] so it's not that i'm ranking on the
[1942.08 - 1946.32] ketos that's not it
[1945.04 - 1949.68] i'm just letting you know it's not the
[1946.32 - 1953.84] keto diet keto diet is
[1949.68 - 1953.84] very little food uh-huh
[1954.00 - 1958.48] and it has to be just meat and then you
[1956.40 - 1960.80] go into a glucose deficit
[1958.48 - 1961.60] and then you go into ketosis is that

[2056.64 - 2062.08] incredible
[2057.92 - 2063.44] proud of you the real keto diet of the
[2062.08 - 2067.28] 80s which i
[2063.44 - 2070.64] watched has been around a long time
[2067.28 - 2071.76] you know which i watched ended a lot of
[2070.64 - 2075.04] lives
[2071.76 - 2078.56] the keto diet you see now is not
[2075.04 - 2080.08] keto it's just a clean animal protein
[2078.56 - 2083.60] diet
[2080.08 - 2085.20] right an ant clean animal protein diet
[2083.60 - 2087.84] without the processed foods
[2085.20 - 2089.92] but there still is carbohydrates it's in
[2087.84 - 2091.92] the avocado it's in the nuts and seed
[2089.92 - 2094.40] butters it's in the seeds the nuts
[2091.92 - 2096.40] there's sugar in there there's sugar you
[2094.40 - 2097.92] can't go into ketosis
[2096.40 - 2099.84] you see how important this information
[2097.92 - 2102.64] is but we walk around
[2099.84 - 2103.84] i mean you can you smart people don't
[2102.64 - 2106.80] know this
[2103.84 - 2109.36] doctors on magazine that talk about keto
[2106.80 - 2112.08] don't even know this
[2109.36 - 2112.72] think about this right like and they're
[2112.08 - 2116.56] smart
[2112.72 - 2120.96] people that's how tricky it all is smart
[2116.56 - 2120.96] people don't know this think about that
[2121.12 - 2124.56] um what they're really on it's just a
[2123.04 - 2126.24] clean animal protein diet and they got
[2124.56 - 2129.44] plenty of not plenty but they got
[2126.24 - 2130.16] some glucose enough glucose to stop the
[2129.44 - 2133.84] ketosis
[2130.16 - 2137.84] process ketosis p strips
[2133.84 - 2141.28] um i'm sorry but they just don't work
[2137.84 - 2142.08] no one can really detect truly what's
[2141.28 - 2143.84] coming out
[2142.08 - 2145.84] in our urine because we don't understand
[2143.84 - 2146.40] our detoxification processes we don't
[2145.84 - 2148.56] understand
[2146.40 - 2150.40] how our kidneys work we don't understand
[2148.56 - 2152.88] what's in our bloodstream how that works
[2150.40 - 2154.24] heck they can't even figure anything out
[2152.88 - 2157.04] with blood tests
[2154.24 - 2157.68] i mean we still don't have a real window
[2157.04 - 2159.36] into why
[2157.68 - 2160.80] first of all we don't have a window into
[2159.36 - 2162.96] why anybody's sick
[2160.80 - 2164.00] so all of a sudden what the ketosis p
[2162.96 - 2166.16] strip is going to have all
[2164.00 - 2168.40] it's going to be like think about that
[2166.16 - 2170.72] right nobody knows why everybody's sick
[2168.40 - 2172.32] nobody knows why 20 year olds are sick
[2170.72 - 2173.68] in bed a mattress island with fatigue
[2172.32 - 2175.36] nobody knows why people have eczema
[2173.68 - 2177.12] psoriasis nobody knows why anybody has
[2175.36 - 2179.84] debilitating depression anxiety
[2177.12 - 2181.04] but the ketosis p strips are just right
[2179.84 - 2182.64] on they're just
[2181.04 - 2184.16] they're infallible right they're just
[2182.64 - 2187.12] perfect right like
[2184.16 - 2187.92] we can't doubt a ketosis p strip god
[2187.12 - 2190.08] forbid
[2187.92 - 2192.40] even though no one knows why anyone is
[2190.08 - 2192.40] sick
[2195.20 - 2198.84] one thing about medical medium
[2196.32 - 2202.24] information is it makes
[2198.84 - 2203.04] sense and if you say well yeah of course
[2202.24 - 2204.00] you're going to say that you're the
[2203.04 - 2205.04] medical medium
[2204.00 - 2206.80] you're going to say it makes sense
[2205.04 - 2208.32] because you're the medical media nice
[2206.80 - 2210.80] try buddy that's what you're going to
[2208.32 - 2212.00] say to me like nice try anthony william
[2210.80 - 2213.44] it makes sense because you're the
[2212.00 - 2214.96] medical media well that's funny because
[2213.44 - 2216.16] i don't have this information it comes
[2214.96 - 2217.92] from above
[2216.16 - 2220.16] okay i had to learn it just like you
[2217.92 - 2221.36] guys i had to learn it just like you
[2220.16 - 2222.96] guys okay
[2221.36 - 2224.64] i'm making another one here this one's a
[2222.96 - 2226.00] little thicker so i might kind of remove
[2224.64 - 2227.52] some but i'm going to see where it goes
[2226.00 - 2231.12] as we go along
[2227.52 - 2236.00] um i might take some of it back
[2231.12 - 2238.16] right so this one's actually perfect
[2236.00 - 2239.44] because you don't want it to fall apart
[2238.16 - 2242.64] and tear
[2239.44 - 2244.56] and this one here is just a lot
[2242.64 - 2246.00] a lot thicker so we're gonna make one
[2244.56 - 2249.20] big one here which i'm actually
[2246.00 - 2250.96] kind of excited about that so
[2249.20 - 2252.96] yeah of course you're gonna think your
[2250.96 - 2256.08] information anthony
[2252.96 - 2257.52] is is perfect it makes sense because
[2256.08 - 2258.00] you're anthony and you're you're
[2257.52 - 2259.60] actually
[2258.00 - 2261.52] talking about it's like well that's
[2259.60 - 2263.20] funny because i had a question spirit of
[2261.52 - 2266.00] compassion my whole life as a
[2263.20 - 2266.32] as as somebody who is learning because
[2266.00 - 2269.52] it's
[2266.32 - 2272.72] it's technically not my information
[2269.52 - 2275.92] it's from above right i'm the messenger
[2272.72 - 2276.88] right i'm the messenger it's no one
[2275.92 - 2278.40] else's information
[2276.88 - 2280.00] it's spirit of compassion's information
[2278.40 - 2283.84] right and then yeah
[2280.00 - 2285.60] of course i'm the one talking about it
[2283.84 - 2286.40] and putting it out there so yeah i guess
[2285.60 - 2287.68] it makes it
[2286.40 - 2289.52] medical medium information my
[2287.68 - 2291.36] information of course right and then
[2289.52 - 2292.08] science takes from it and they take what
[2291.36 - 2294.16] they want from
[2292.08 - 2296.24] it and they don't cite me and they and
[2294.16 - 2298.16] they plagiarize it which
[2296.24 - 2299.68] they are not allowed legally allowed to
[2298.16 - 2301.52] do that by the way
[2299.68 - 2302.80] but i still have this thing in me that
[2301.52 - 2306.48] wants people to learn
[2302.80 - 2309.20] so i don't like come down on
[2306.48 - 2310.32] on on that whole thing too hard but the
[2309.20 - 2313.12] point is is
[2310.32 - 2315.36] medical meme information published first
[2313.12 - 2317.28] you know is then taken and used other
[2315.36 - 2318.56] places without citing medical medium
[2317.28 - 2321.04] information so other people can find
[2318.56 - 2324.40] their way back and feel completely
[2321.04 - 2327.84] but either way it makes sense
[2324.40 - 2330.96] it just it's info that makes sense right
[2327.84 - 2333.76] now i know you guys are smart so
[2330.96 - 2335.12] when you learn this information you guys
[2333.76 - 2338.72] are like okay
[2335.12 - 2339.68] yeah well there is in order to hit
[2338.72 - 2342.00] ketosis
[2339.68 - 2343.28] you can't have sugars you can't have
[2342.00 - 2345.44] glucose or sugars
[2343.28 - 2347.04] nuts and seeds have a large percentage a
[2345.44 - 2349.36] large percentage of nuts and seeds
[2347.04 - 2352.56] they're sweet they actually have a
[2349.36 - 2355.20] sweetness to it peanut butter is sweet
[2352.56 - 2356.96] right there's a sweetness to these nuts
[2355.20 - 2357.84] and seeds and butters right there's also
[2356.96 - 2359.84] the fat too
[2357.84 - 2362.24] but there's a sweetness can't go into
[2359.84 - 2364.32] that ketosis with with all that there
[2362.24 - 2365.92] right but you can go in it if you're on
[2364.32 - 2368.48] a little piece of chicken
[2365.92 - 2369.52] right a little piece of meat you keep
[2368.48 - 2371.68] your calories down
[2369.52 - 2372.88] and that's all you eat each day and then
[2371.68 - 2374.80] guess what you're gonna hit that
[2372.88 - 2376.32] ketogenic state and guess what
[2374.80 - 2378.08] if you're somebody who's sick and not
[2376.32 - 2380.88] well or somebody who's not even
[2378.08 - 2382.96] sick you're gonna go downhill downhill
[2380.88 - 2384.08] downhill downhill because guess what
[2382.96 - 2387.28] your brain
[2384.08 - 2388.64] needs glucose it dies without it
[2387.28 - 2390.40] you guys on clubhouse i'm going to tell
[2388.64 - 2391.68] you right now without your without
[2390.40 - 2394.56] glucose in your brain
[2391.68 - 2396.00] in five seconds your brain starts to die
[2394.56 - 2397.68] your brain's made out of sugar
[2396.00 - 2399.28] now the reason why carnivore people can
[2397.68 - 2401.52] survive and
[2399.28 - 2403.60] i'll tell you why they survive because
[2401.52 - 2404.64] they're eating larger amounts of food
[2403.60 - 2406.16] they're eating larger
[2404.64 - 2408.16] larger amounts of meat and there's
[2406.16 - 2408.88] enough blood sugar in that animal's
[2408.16 - 2411.76] blood
[2408.88 - 2414.72] when it was killed to give them enough
[2411.76 - 2416.72] glucose to stop the ketosis process
[2414.72 - 2418.24] so even a carnivore person doesn't go
[2416.72 - 2419.60] into ketosis
[2418.24 - 2421.68] right and plus they're eating some
[2419.60 - 2423.68] cheese which is sugar it's lactose
[2421.68 - 2425.52] plus you're eating some other stuff too
[2423.68 - 2428.00] you know i mean and plus they
[2425.52 - 2429.12] they put in the chocolate with with some
[2428.00 - 2430.80] they bring in their sweet
[2429.12 - 2432.48] i can't tell you how many how many
[2430.80 - 2433.28] carnivore people are still having their
[2432.48 - 2434.88] chocolate bar
[2433.28 - 2437.12] and they got the cane sugar in the
[2434.88 - 2439.20] chocolate bar and you know they got
[2437.12 - 2441.76] you know i mean the whole bit all right
[2439.20 - 2444.16] guys i'm gonna throw this in the oven
[2441.76 - 2445.76] i think we're good it's gonna be a thick
[2444.16 - 2448.40] wrap but you know what
[2445.76 - 2449.84] it's gonna come out good so i'm showing
[2448.40 - 2450.40] you what i got going on here you see
[2449.84 - 2452.72] this
[2450.40 - 2454.16] basically we have two pizzas right two
[2452.72 - 2455.60] potato pizzas
[2454.16 - 2459.12] but what i'm going to do is fill these
[2455.60 - 2460.64] babies up i got tomatoes i got cucumbers
[2459.12 - 2462.08] i got all i got some sprouts
[2460.64 - 2464.48] i'm excited about this let me get this
[2462.08 - 2466.00] in the oven
[2464.48 - 2467.44] how much can you guys see over here can
[2466.00 - 2470.56] you see the oven over here i'm not even
[2467.44 - 2470.56] sure if you guys can see this
[2470.88 - 2474.08] okay we're in the oven now
[2474.24 - 2482.32] we're in there let's cook that puppy up
[2480.72 - 2484.96] while that's going there i might do a
[2482.32 - 2486.16] little chopping if you guys are okay
[2484.96 - 2488.00] we'll see we'll see we'll give it a
[2486.16 - 2490.00] minute um
[2488.00 - 2491.20] chop some stuff up in a few seconds
[2490.00 - 2493.12] right so
[2491.20 - 2494.88] i'm not against i'm not against animal
[2493.12 - 2496.56] protein diets i'm not against eating
[2494.88 - 2498.48] animal protein if you want to do that
[2496.56 - 2499.76] i just want to help you do it right i
[2498.48 - 2501.12] want to make sure you can have it in
[2499.76 - 2501.68] your life if that's what you want and
[2501.12 - 2504.24] still
[2501.68 - 2506.16] heal so mm info is about making sure
[2504.24 - 2508.56] whether you're animal or plant-based
[2506.16 - 2510.32] which side of the aisle are you on it it
[2508.56 - 2512.24] still means you can heal
[2510.32 - 2514.16] but you need the tools to heal and
[2512.24 - 2516.32] that's why the animal protein people and
[2514.16 - 2518.56] the keto people and everybody else like
[2516.32 - 2519.52] eating clean diets they still get sick
[2518.56 - 2521.44] they're still sick
[2519.52 - 2523.76] and they're still in the dentist chairs
[2521.44 - 2524.32] the the plant-based people the vegan
[2523.76 - 2527.28] people
[2524.32 - 2529.12] still get sick but the thing is i feel
[2527.28 - 2531.92] bad about the plant-based people
[2529.12 - 2533.68] the minute they get sick they are
[2531.92 - 2536.64] running
[2533.68 - 2537.28] running for the eggs running for the
[2536.64 - 2539.76] eggs
[2537.28 - 2541.20] they get scared their doctor tells them
[2539.76 - 2542.56] they need their protein you shouldn't
[2541.20 - 2543.52] have been vegan you shouldn't have been
[2542.56 - 2546.32] plant-based
[2543.52 - 2547.04] and you go running for not everyone but
[2546.32 - 2549.76] you run
[2547.04 - 2550.48] for the eggs it's why the plant-based
[2549.76 - 2553.04] people
[2550.48 - 2554.72] never really attacked the eggs they
[2553.04 - 2555.12] never hit the eggs hard they kept them
[2554.72 - 2557.76] like
[2555.12 - 2558.96] coveted eggs are coveted by everybody on
[2557.76 - 2561.76] the planet right
[2558.96 - 2563.04] medical medium is the only is the only
[2561.76 - 2564.96] place where it was
[2563.04 - 2566.72] like you know the eggs are bad the eggs
[2564.96 - 2568.32] are bad all these years going like 30
[2566.72 - 2570.88] years now the eggs are bad it's all
[2568.32 - 2571.84] medical medium eggs are bad right what
[2570.88 - 2573.76] happens is
[2571.84 - 2575.84] man the plant-based people they kind of
[2573.76 - 2577.52] keep that like a dark secret
[2575.84 - 2579.60] i'm not making fun of them i get it it's
[2577.52 - 2580.72] a comfort food you keep it as a dark
[2579.60 - 2584.16] secret you always know
[2580.72 - 2585.44] somewhere somehow you can always fall
[2584.16 - 2587.28] back on those eggs

[2629.12 - 2633.04] different
[2630.16 - 2634.72] vegan cookies right plant-based people

[2650.00 - 2655.12] vegan grilled cheese sandwich

[2655.12 - 2658.56] the vegan cheese and the gluten-free
[2657.68 - 2661.44] bread
[2658.56 - 2662.08] right they'll run for that so you know
[2661.44 - 2663.76] it's worth
[2662.08 - 2665.92] the vegans and the plant-based they get
[2663.76 - 2668.40] their comfort zone they're running for
[2665.92 - 2668.88] all the cheese the vegan cheese or the
[2668.40 - 2670.32] real
[2668.88 - 2671.68] cheese when they get sick because then
[2670.32 - 2672.96] they're like whoa i think i need my
[2671.68 - 2675.44] protein i heard there's
[2672.96 - 2676.72] this you know this raw cheese diet i
[2675.44 - 2678.96] could be on and
[2676.72 - 2680.96] raw butter and stuff like that and you
[2678.96 - 2681.92] know the real stuff you know and you see
[2680.96 - 2683.84] somebody else
[2681.92 - 2685.20] on the internet or youtube channel and
[2683.84 - 2687.52] they're raising their own
[2685.20 - 2689.20] um you know raising their own cattle
[2687.52 - 2690.32] they're dude they're cows they're doing
[2689.20 - 2693.12] the bug their own
[2690.32 - 2694.56] butter and i'm not harping on any of it
[2693.12 - 2697.04] i'm not harping on any of it
[2694.56 - 2698.48] you guys i want you to be able to do
[2697.04 - 2701.60] what you want be free
[2698.48 - 2704.56] but i got this thing where the chains of
[2701.60 - 2708.80] the chronically ill like the chains
[2704.56 - 2712.48] of chronic illness the chains that
[2708.80 - 2714.48] keep people down right and sick right
[2712.48 - 2716.96] and the industry's behind them right
[2714.48 - 2717.68] so when you're sick and you can't get
[2716.96 - 2720.40] out of it
[2717.68 - 2722.32] there's a way there's a way you might
[2720.40 - 2725.36] have to let go of your eggs
[2722.32 - 2727.36] but there's a way okay you might have to
[2725.36 - 2729.36] let go of the butter but there's a way
[2727.36 - 2730.64] you might have to let go of the cacao
[2729.36 - 2733.76] but there's a way
[2730.64 - 2736.96] the caffeine you might have to let
[2733.76 - 2738.80] something go but you know what
[2736.96 - 2740.40] spirit of compassion is going to make
[2738.80 - 2742.24] sure you're able to eat more things than
[2740.40 - 2745.28] you ever could imagine
[2742.24 - 2746.96] more so than the other diet belief
[2745.28 - 2748.96] systems believe it or not
[2746.96 - 2751.20] because they're all anti-fruit pretty
[2748.96 - 2753.04] much and if the plant-based ones aren't
[2751.20 - 2755.36] it came from medical medium
[2753.04 - 2756.96] because they always were going all the
[2755.36 - 2758.32] way back you know what you know what
[2756.96 - 2760.88] you know what the vegans did back 30
[2758.32 - 2762.24] years ago can i tell you
[2760.88 - 2764.24] it was dried fruit was the only thing
[2762.24 - 2764.96] they eat fresh fruit wasn't even in the
[2764.24 - 2768.00] equation
[2764.96 - 2770.32] it was dried fruit it was dried fruit
[2768.00 - 2773.28] so that's where it was it was like
[2770.32 - 2776.16] people it was raisins it was like people
[2773.28 - 2778.32] you know and here's the thing mm info
[2776.16 - 2782.32] can give you guys fruits apples cherries
[2778.32 - 2785.52] berries melons right peaches nectarines
[2782.32 - 2787.44] mangoes papayas said the bananas right
[2785.52 - 2789.36] and then the other part is leafy greens
[2787.44 - 2790.32] getting all these leafy greens in there
[2789.36 - 2792.96] and then the wild
[2790.32 - 2794.64] foods right the wild fruits like you
[2792.96 - 2796.32] know the wild the blueberries right
[2794.64 - 2797.04] that's the wild blueberry juice but it's
[2796.32 - 2799.76] all about
[2797.04 - 2801.20] it's all about the wild foods too and
[2799.76 - 2805.12] the aloe
[2801.20 - 2808.16] in all of this it's about not having
[2805.12 - 2809.28] fear it's not having it's not having
[2808.16 - 2812.24] fruit fear
[2809.28 - 2813.44] so it's about knowing how like i'm sick
[2812.24 - 2816.88] why am i sick
[2813.44 - 2817.68] what can i do and then not not fearing
[2816.88 - 2820.40] anything
[2817.68 - 2820.72] because you got answers and and foods
[2820.40 - 2822.24] too
[2820.72 - 2824.16] this is going to be an amazing dish so
[2822.24 - 2826.88] let me chop up some stuff right here
[2824.16 - 2828.40] um i got that cooking right now in the
[2826.88 - 2831.28] oven right now
[2828.40 - 2833.12] soul seeker az says so true i've never
[2831.28 - 2836.16] had such a variety of foods
[2833.12 - 2837.68] flavors tastes life is beautiful
[2836.16 - 2840.00] soul seeker that's a whole thing it's
[2837.68 - 2842.00] like the other diet belief systems all
[2840.00 - 2843.44] through the years were anti-tomato i got
[2842.00 - 2844.00] these beautiful tomatoes in front of me
[2843.44 - 2846.16] isn't this like
[2844.00 - 2847.60] it's saying look at these tomatoes so
[2846.16 - 2851.12] many other belief systems
[2847.60 - 2853.44] right were anti-onions and anti-garlic
[2851.12 - 2855.04] right if you like onions garlic you can
[2853.44 - 2857.20] have them okay
[2855.04 - 2859.36] right so all the different a lot of
[2857.20 - 2859.92] other belief systems were anti-sprouts
[2859.36 - 2861.76] you got
[2859.92 - 2864.48] all the different sprouts a lot of other
[2861.76 - 2866.32] belief systems were anti-potatoes
[2864.48 - 2868.16] and you got all the potatoes you want
[2866.32 - 2868.48] including anti-sweet potatoes out there
[2868.16 - 2870.96] too
[2868.48 - 2872.08] sweet potatoes right and then people
[2870.96 - 2874.64] didn't know about
[2872.08 - 2875.28] winter squash and how awesome that is
[2874.64 - 2877.68] too
[2875.28 - 2878.64] and then the melons everybody feared the
[2877.68 - 2881.12] melons
[2878.64 - 2882.56] watermelon honeydew melon people didn't
[2881.12 - 2883.84] even know they could even eat a honeydew
[2882.56 - 2886.08] melon right
[2883.84 - 2887.44] and so it's all the different things
[2886.08 - 2890.88] that we can eat
[2887.44 - 2892.88] and the figs and the apples
[2890.88 - 2894.56] i heard for years you guys from doctors
[2892.88 - 2895.60] that would contact me over the years and
[2894.56 - 2898.56] they would say
[2895.60 - 2899.76] did you tell my patient that they can
[2898.56 - 2902.96] have
[2899.76 - 2903.52] apples i said yeah and not the green
[2902.96 - 2905.44] apple
[2903.52 - 2907.60] i'm like what do you mean not the green
[2905.44 - 2909.04] apple and be like yeah the green apple
[2907.60 - 2910.24] they're only my patients are only
[2909.04 - 2912.40] allowed green apples
[2910.24 - 2914.16] it's like why because apples have too
[2912.40 - 2917.20] much sugar it's fruit
[2914.16 - 2919.04] so it's only green apple and i'm like
[2917.20 - 2920.64] okay well it's your patient that's what
[2919.04 - 2921.92] you can do but then don't don't send
[2920.64 - 2923.76] your patients to me
[2921.92 - 2925.04] because i'm gonna actually you know make
[2923.76 - 2927.52] sure they can have
[2925.04 - 2928.08] other things too and it's like it's like
[2927.52 - 2930.64] like
[2928.08 - 2931.92] real apples not just the green granny
[2930.64 - 2933.84] smith apple
[2931.92 - 2935.60] that you can't taste really any kind of
[2933.84 - 2938.24] sugar or any kind of glucose
[2935.60 - 2939.76] and people don't realize your brain dies
[2938.24 - 2942.72] without the glucose
[2939.76 - 2944.24] and if you don't keep the fats down low
[2942.72 - 2948.56] you can't get sugar
[2944.24 - 2951.44] to your brain cacao is high in fat
[2948.56 - 2953.36] and caffeine right so two things are
[2951.44 - 2955.04] wrong right there the caffeine damages
[2953.36 - 2957.76] your adrenals
[2955.04 - 2958.80] and the fat keeps glucose from going to
[2957.76 - 2960.72] your brain
[2958.80 - 2962.56] so then you get addicted because the
[2960.72 - 2963.76] fats blocking everything so that's what
[2962.56 - 2964.80] happens with chocolate you're eating
[2963.76 - 2967.68] your chocolate
[2964.80 - 2969.12] and you're eating your cookies and stuff
[2967.68 - 2971.12] and you get addicted
[2969.12 - 2972.32] you get addicted to that fat here's what
[2971.12 - 2975.20] it is it's like
[2972.32 - 2976.88] the sugar's not getting to your brain
[2975.20 - 2979.28] because the fats blocking it it's called
[2976.88 - 2981.36] insulin resistance everybody gets it
[2979.28 - 2983.36] you have a chocolate bar then that
[2981.36 - 2986.00] chocolate bar has honey in it or
[2983.36 - 2987.44] or raw sugar or something right you know
[2986.00 - 2990.72] like honey and raw sugar which is
[2987.44 - 2993.12] which is fine right but then any kind of
[2990.72 - 2995.12] sugar in your diet or any kind of sugar
[2993.12 - 2996.40] in your chocolate like whatever it is
[2995.12 - 2999.28] you can't get
[2996.40 - 3001.36] the sugar to your brain um you seem fine
[2999.28 - 3002.08] to me chris says pizza has more sugar
[3001.36 - 3005.12] than fruit
[3002.08 - 3006.32] oh yeah big time big time i'm checking
[3005.12 - 3008.64] on my pizzas

[3490.32 - 3494.96] okay so um the point i'm making is
[3493.12 - 3498.00] medical medium information is about more
[3494.96 - 3499.36] foods than anybody really knows but then
[3498.00 - 3501.20] when someone says
[3499.36 - 3502.88] stay away from those nightshades
[3501.20 - 3503.84] whatever diet you guys have been on or
[3502.88 - 3505.36] tried right
[3503.84 - 3506.96] somebody says stay away from those night
[3505.36 - 3510.08] shades okay
[3506.96 - 3511.76] now your peppers all gone can't do any
[3510.08 - 3513.76] peppers no bell peppers no
[3511.76 - 3515.68] you know no red bell peppers orange
[3513.76 - 3517.52] these are ripe peppers

[3519.44 - 3523.12] gone eggplant's gone right stay away
[3522.24 - 3526.08] from those nightshades
[3523.12 - 3527.28] nope no the tomatoes all the the variety
[3526.08 - 3529.68] of tomatoes
[3527.28 - 3530.88] alone easy ten varieties of tomatoes you
[3529.68 - 3533.20] can get in the stores
[3530.88 - 3534.24] gone so guess what we just lost 100
[3533.20 - 3537.60] foods
[3534.24 - 3538.56] we lost 100 foods um i'm we're losing 10
[3537.60 - 3539.84] foods at a time
[3538.56 - 3542.08] with all the different diet belief
[3539.84 - 3545.44] systems 10 foods at a time
[3542.08 - 3546.72] think about that checking these pizza
[3545.44 - 3547.84] crusts because they're cooking they're
[3546.72 - 3548.96] looking good
[3547.84 - 3550.80] they're good they're they're they're
[3548.96 - 3552.40] getting some air pockets in them they're
[3550.80 - 3553.68] in the oven they're baking you guys in
[3552.40 - 3554.80] clubhouse we're making
[3553.68 - 3556.96] you know i don't know if you can see it
[3554.80 - 3558.40] but you know if you look on youtube or
[3556.96 - 3560.08] facebook right now
[3558.40 - 3561.28] youtube's probably where to go facebook
[3560.08 - 3562.64] they're just censoring and kicking
[3561.28 - 3564.40] everybody off right
[3562.64 - 3566.16] i'm not against animal protein if that's
[3564.40 - 3568.80] what you guys want in your diet
[3566.16 - 3570.88] i'm not but look how many foods there
[3568.80 - 3572.00] are so you can actually lower your
[3570.88 - 3574.40] animal proteins a little
[3572.00 - 3575.04] bit because your animal proteins are
[3574.40 - 3578.16] animal
[3575.04 - 3581.52] fat that's the fact
[3578.16 - 3583.44] fat stops us from healing you fat
[3581.52 - 3585.12] yourself to death it stops you from
[3583.44 - 3586.00] healing we're fatting ourselves to death
[3585.12 - 3587.92] we're a society
[3586.00 - 3589.36] that's fattening ourselves to death and
[3587.92 - 3590.88] alter the alternative medicine
[3589.36 - 3591.92] conventional medicine is all about high
[3590.88 - 3594.40] fat right now
[3591.92 - 3596.40] complete talking about the matrix again
[3594.40 - 3598.96] we're back in the matrix again
[3596.40 - 3601.12] it's misinformation everybody hops on
[3598.96 - 3603.36] the trend train
[3601.12 - 3604.16] and now everybody thinks it's good to
[3603.36 - 3606.80] just just
[3604.16 - 3607.52] bombard your system with fats kill when
[3606.80 - 3608.72] you don't know it
[3607.52 - 3610.56] you're killing your gallbladder you're
[3608.72 - 3612.40] killing your liver when you've got that
[3610.56 - 3614.08] gallbladder that wants to explode down
[3612.40 - 3615.76] the road or you got that liver
[3614.08 - 3617.36] that just wants to get sick down the
[3615.76 - 3620.00] road you don't know
[3617.36 - 3620.56] all that trendy information led you
[3620.00 - 3622.48] there
[3620.56 - 3623.76] it was it was one of those things that
[3622.48 - 3625.60] led you there
[3623.76 - 3627.44] and people are fatting themselves to
[3625.60 - 3630.08] death and that's what they're doing
[3627.44 - 3632.32] um okay so i got thinly sliced cucumbers
[3630.08 - 3635.36] here thinly sliced tomatoes here
[3632.32 - 3639.60] this is really coming out good okay
[3635.36 - 3639.60] so um it's moving some of these out
[3640.32 - 3644.08] what i like about if you want to do some
[3642.32 - 3644.96] animal protein do it at the end of the
[3644.08 - 3646.48] day
[3644.96 - 3648.88] right don't do it in the middle of the
[3646.48 - 3650.80] day don't do the breakfast morning time
[3648.88 - 3652.08] and the whole intermittent fasting thing
[3650.80 - 3653.92] that came about
[3652.08 - 3656.16] has helped people to some degree it's
[3653.92 - 3656.72] still not perfect at all on any level
[3656.16 - 3659.60] because
[3656.72 - 3661.44] when you intermittent fast you still you
[3659.60 - 3663.20] still don't get the things you need so
[3661.44 - 3665.12] you'll age you'll still age
[3663.20 - 3666.40] quickly down the road right because
[3665.12 - 3668.16] you're living off adrenaline and
[3666.40 - 3671.04] adrenaline ages us
[3668.16 - 3671.76] it ages us all that adrenaline so if we
[3671.04 - 3674.00] stay
[3671.76 - 3675.84] on the intermittent fasting train we're
[3674.00 - 3677.12] eventually just going to get dried up
[3675.84 - 3678.72] down the road we're going to just our
[3677.12 - 3680.16] adrenaline is going to dry us
[3678.72 - 3682.24] up we're going to be a plant that
[3680.16 - 3684.40] eventually gets dried up
[3682.24 - 3685.60] and then you know and we age quick and
[3684.40 - 3686.80] the wrinkles come
[3685.60 - 3689.12] and everything else but yeah
[3686.80 - 3690.32] intermittent fasting actually helps
[3689.12 - 3691.76] people temporarily
[3690.32 - 3693.84] because it's giving them energy because
[3691.76 - 3694.80] they're not doing steak and eggs in the
[3693.84 - 3696.64] morning anymore
[3694.80 - 3698.24] they're not doing bacon in the morning
[3696.64 - 3699.68] they're not doing all that nut butter in
[3698.24 - 3700.40] the morning they're not doing the fats
[3699.68 - 3702.72] in the morning
[3700.40 - 3704.00] they're not doing all that nut butter
[3702.72 - 3705.52] and cheese in the morning
[3704.00 - 3706.80] cheese and eggs they're not doing all
[3705.52 - 3708.32] their eggs in the morning because when
[3706.80 - 3709.92] you intermittent fast doesn't mean they
[3708.32 - 3711.36] don't eat that at the end of the day
[3709.92 - 3713.04] but when you intermittent fast you're
[3711.36 - 3715.20] giving your liver a break
[3713.04 - 3716.80] that's how it works and you're get
[3715.20 - 3718.32] you're giving yourself a break you're
[3716.80 - 3719.36] giving your liver a break when you
[3718.32 - 3721.36] intermittent fast
[3719.36 - 3723.04] right this is still cooking up it's
[3721.36 - 3725.60] coming around i still want to get a
[3723.04 - 3728.32] little bit more toastier
[3725.60 - 3730.24] so serena says that food makes you sick
[3728.32 - 3733.52] what about the fact you were already
[3730.24 - 3734.24] sick well we're eating fats our whole
[3733.52 - 3736.80] life
[3734.24 - 3738.40] that's what's going on we eat fats our
[3736.80 - 3739.68] whole life we're taught to just be on
[3738.40 - 3742.48] fats our whole life
[3739.68 - 3744.08] right our kids are eating hot dogs right
[3742.48 - 3744.80] our kids are eating chicken or kids are
[3744.08 - 3746.96] eating
[3744.80 - 3748.32] peanut butter right it's not just about
[3746.96 - 3751.60] animal protein it's plant
[3748.32 - 3753.60] fat too okay so oils
[3751.60 - 3754.88] all of it fried food or kids are eating
[3753.60 - 3758.40] fried food
[3754.88 - 3760.80] so what no kids ever have fried food no
[3758.40 - 3761.60] no kids ever had hot dogs no kids ever
[3760.80 - 3763.92] had
[3761.60 - 3765.60] chicken fingers no kids ever had any of
[3763.92 - 3769.84] that kind of thing right
[3765.60 - 3769.84] you know and um
[3771.04 - 3775.44] but what it is not just that and i know
[3773.92 - 3777.68] that i'm heading there it's not just
[3775.44 - 3777.68] that
[3777.92 - 3783.20] it's like it's like
[3780.96 - 3784.80] it's it's not just like our children
[3783.20 - 3785.28] eating the chicken fingers and the
[3784.80 - 3788.72] little
[3785.28 - 3791.60] you know buffalo chicken wings right and
[3788.72 - 3792.32] you know the hot dogs okay it's we're
[3791.60 - 3795.12] trained
[3792.32 - 3796.32] we're raised on fat and we're trained to
[3795.12 - 3798.32] be on fat right
[3796.32 - 3800.32] but it's not just this you can do this
[3798.32 - 3802.88] and still not get sick for a while
[3800.32 - 3803.84] but you end up getting a pathogen or you
[3802.88 - 3805.84] end up getting
[3803.84 - 3807.04] which everybody has in the end they'll
[3805.84 - 3808.16] have their epsine bars they'll have
[3807.04 - 3810.48] their streptococcus
[3808.16 - 3811.52] and it's those pathogens that get away
[3810.48 - 3813.92] from us
[3811.52 - 3814.64] because we keep on bombarding ourselves
[3813.92 - 3817.12] with cheese
[3814.64 - 3817.76] and butter and we're dropping our immune
[3817.12 - 3820.08] system with
[3817.76 - 3821.84] all that fat and that's how it works and
[3820.08 - 3823.28] then we're eating eggs and that feeds
[3821.84 - 3824.72] the pathogens it's all important
[3823.28 - 3828.32] information
[3824.72 - 3828.32] i think these are just about ready here
[3828.96 - 3832.96] i don't know maybe a couple more minutes
[3830.64 - 3839.84] actually and we're good
[3832.96 - 3841.84] so um
[3839.84 - 3844.88] but the bottom line is you can be you
[3841.84 - 3847.28] can be look you can still heal
[3844.88 - 3848.80] and but it's about having those tools
[3847.28 - 3850.08] lowering the fats is really a good way
[3848.80 - 3851.36] to heal if you're sick
[3850.08 - 3853.20] bringing them down a little bit so if
[3851.36 - 3853.92] you're doing animal protein do it at the
[3853.20 - 3856.00] end of the day
[3853.92 - 3857.44] don't do a lot of it maybe do it every
[3856.00 - 3859.60] other day but get ready for this if
[3857.44 - 3862.16] you're vegan or plant-based you guys
[3859.60 - 3864.00] right do the avocado at the end of the
[3862.16 - 3865.28] day and do it every other day
[3864.00 - 3868.48] right just bring in some steamed
[3865.28 - 3870.56] potatoes okay bring in papaya bananas do
[3868.48 - 3872.32] the smoothies bring in steamed potatoes
[3870.56 - 3873.68] do the leafy greens keep the leafy
[3872.32 - 3875.44] greens going in there
[3873.68 - 3876.96] all of that do the spinach and leafy
[3875.44 - 3879.44] greens do more fruit
[3876.96 - 3881.28] and then keep your fats try to stay away
[3879.44 - 3882.00] from the cacao and all the nut butters
[3881.28 - 3883.76] and everything
[3882.00 - 3885.28] look i know this information is annoying
[3883.76 - 3887.84] in some way but
[3885.28 - 3889.28] it's not annoying when you're sick
[3887.84 - 3891.92] what's more annoying
[3889.28 - 3893.20] is it just being sick all the different
[3891.92 - 3895.20] aches and pains and
[3893.20 - 3896.64] tingles and numbness and exorisis and
[3895.20 - 3898.32] acne and
[3896.64 - 3900.00] you're sluggish and you're just and
[3898.32 - 3901.68] you're fatigued and
[3900.00 - 3902.56] you're just you're hitting the doctor's
[3901.68 - 3904.00] office you've got the functional
[3902.56 - 3905.52] medicine doctor now your chinese
[3904.00 - 3907.28] medicine doctor and you're
[3905.52 - 3908.72] now you're at the dentist and now you're
[3907.28 - 3909.52] back at the doctors and you're you know
[3908.72 - 3910.64] back to functional
[3909.52 - 3912.56] now you're back at your conventional
[3910.64 - 3914.24] doctor and and
[3912.56 - 3915.68] what's more annoying is it that or
[3914.24 - 3918.64] having tools to actually
[3915.68 - 3921.04] be able to rise out of that okay and
[3918.64 - 3923.60] grains can be okay for people if they're
[3921.04 - 3924.96] not dealing with pathogens and
[3923.60 - 3927.68] other things or if they're not super
[3924.96 - 3929.68] sick and fats can be okay for people if
[3927.68 - 3930.24] they're not super sick with pathogens
[3929.68 - 3931.60] right
[3930.24 - 3933.20] but when everybody's sick and they're
[3931.60 - 3934.32] getting all the symptoms then we've got
[3933.20 - 3935.76] something we need to do
[3934.32 - 3939.04] we need to do something all right these
[3935.76 - 3939.04] are done i'm going to pull them out
[3939.20 - 3944.88] so i'm going to do that now
[3948.84 - 3951.84] and
[3958.72 - 3961.76] this thing is really really hot so i'm
[3960.56 - 3963.36] just letting you guys know
[3961.76 - 3966.24] so i'm going to kind of pop this right
[3963.36 - 3966.24] here okay
[3968.56 - 3972.40] there we go i'm going to move this over
[3977.52 - 3981.76] let me get these tomatoes out of the way
[3979.52 - 3984.64] you guys are okay with that
[3981.76 - 3985.76] all right i'm gonna move them out all
[3984.64 - 3990.72] right
[3985.76 - 3993.92] and so i got these pizza crusts
[3990.72 - 3996.48] you guys seeing i mean
[3993.92 - 3998.48] these are really awesome they really are
[3996.48 - 4001.52] i'm gonna actually take this knife
[3998.48 - 4003.04] and cut this one right here they
[4001.52 - 4004.84] probably could have been in the oven a
[4003.04 - 4009.36] little bit longer
[4004.84 - 4009.36] but look at that peels right off
[4010.72 - 4014.64] i needed the oven probably a touch more
[4018.84 - 4021.84] and
[4024.56 - 4027.68] but i'm going to let them cool a little
[4025.92 - 4030.32] bit that's really going to help so let's
[4027.68 - 4030.32] let them cool
[4030.72 - 4034.32] and then we're almost there we're about
[4032.48 - 4035.68] to plate this up and get it to get it
[4034.32 - 4040.16] going
[4035.68 - 4042.56] so i look at it this way every time
[4040.16 - 4043.76] a doctor contacted me over the years and
[4042.56 - 4045.36] said
[4043.76 - 4047.20] i have a patient dealing with a lot of
[4045.36 - 4048.48] mystery symptoms they got the tingles
[4047.20 - 4051.44] the fatigue
[4048.48 - 4052.64] they got numb toes they got back pain
[4051.44 - 4054.96] neck pain
[4052.64 - 4056.40] their teeth hurt they're highly
[4054.96 - 4058.80] sensitive
[4056.40 - 4059.76] they're brain fogged out how many of you
[4058.80 - 4063.44] guys got brain fog
[4059.76 - 4065.52] have had uh brain fog right um
[4063.44 - 4067.52] uh nirashini good to see you i studied
[4065.52 - 4069.84] medicine for two years and there was no
[4067.52 - 4071.60] nutritional course in those years

[4082.32 - 4084.96] incredible
[4083.44 - 4086.96] and you guys care i know you guys
[4084.96 - 4090.24] actually really truly care
[4086.96 - 4091.36] you really do um let's have doctors over
[4090.24 - 4093.84] the years ask me
[4091.36 - 4096.56] you know look um can you work with
[4093.84 - 4099.44] someone if they're eating animal protein
[4096.56 - 4100.64] like yeah of course um can you work with
[4099.44 - 4103.28] someone if they're
[4100.64 - 4104.48] vegan or want to be vegan or plant-based
[4103.28 - 4106.24] yeah of course
[4104.48 - 4108.24] it's like how's that possible like how
[4106.24 - 4111.20] is that possible i don't get it
[4108.24 - 4112.40] how right how is that possible and it's
[4111.20 - 4114.56] possible because
[4112.40 - 4115.76] of knowing why someone's sick and either
[4114.56 - 4116.72] side doesn't know
[4115.76 - 4118.40] and that's why the vegans are
[4116.72 - 4119.92] plant-based people get sick you guys and
[4118.40 - 4121.68] that's why the animal protein people
[4119.92 - 4124.64] keto people whatever you want to call it
[4121.68 - 4125.60] get sick because they all do and then
[4124.64 - 4127.52] they flip flop
[4125.60 - 4129.28] and it's like flip-flop back flip-flop
[4127.52 - 4130.00] back here flip-flop flip-flop and then
[4129.28 - 4133.68] everybody's
[4130.00 - 4135.76] looking for this sacred root somewhere
[4133.68 - 4137.92] in the amazon everybody's looking for
[4135.76 - 4140.16] this next trendy thing
[4137.92 - 4141.44] they're looking like for maca powder to
[4140.16 - 4143.52] save their life
[4141.44 - 4144.64] they're looking for like deer antler to
[4143.52 - 4147.44] save their life
[4144.64 - 4147.84] they're looking for something to you
[4147.44 - 4150.24] know

[4150.24 - 4153.28] now to save their life they're looking
[4151.52 - 4153.68] for something that can save their life
[4153.28 - 4155.12] right
[4153.68 - 4157.28] because it's a guessing game and you go
[4155.12 - 4160.32] on that journey of a guessing game
[4157.28 - 4162.56] and and this is
[4160.32 - 4163.84] important because that guessing game
[4162.56 - 4166.16] journey can wear you
[4163.84 - 4168.72] down and wear you down and break you
[4166.16 - 4171.84] down and break you down over time
[4168.72 - 4174.48] and that was you so yeah and and
[4171.84 - 4176.08] totally get it so the bottom line is
[4174.48 - 4177.68] i'll give you some takeaways right now
[4176.08 - 4179.20] okay definitely let's do takeaways
[4177.68 - 4181.04] before i plate this up and make this
[4179.20 - 4184.40] into like a really nice meal
[4181.04 - 4186.16] um the takeaways for this wherever
[4184.40 - 4189.04] whatever aisle you're on you got to
[4186.16 - 4193.60] bring down the fats that's the key
[4189.04 - 4196.64] it's not you don't get an award
[4193.60 - 4199.60] for plant-based keto when i
[4196.64 - 4200.96] hear it i go oh my god that's somebody
[4199.60 - 4202.64] that's going to get sick down the road
[4200.96 - 4203.76] and they're gonna leave plant-based
[4202.64 - 4206.00] they're gonna leave the plant-based
[4203.76 - 4206.72] movement they're gonna get sick down the
[4206.00 - 4209.76] road
[4206.72 - 4211.28] good to see you emcee uh mc says people
[4209.76 - 4212.32] are looking because you're in pain good
[4211.28 - 4215.68] to see you tonight
[4212.32 - 4218.48] so um i read your comments a lot
[4215.68 - 4221.04] austin good to see you tonight right the
[4218.48 - 4224.40] deal is you have to learn what's wrong
[4221.04 - 4226.08] you have to learn why you are sick
[4224.40 - 4228.40] that's the deal and then when you learn
[4226.08 - 4231.84] that you know that plant-based
[4228.40 - 4234.72] keto isn't the answer to heal high-fat
[4231.84 - 4235.92] vegan and high-fat plant-based will keep
[4234.72 - 4238.72] you sick
[4235.92 - 4239.92] if you're sick enough if you haven't
[4238.72 - 4241.44] gone there yet
[4239.92 - 4243.04] if you haven't gone to that place of
[4241.44 - 4245.52] being sick enough yet
[4243.04 - 4246.32] then you can probably do okay on that
[4245.52 - 4249.52] plant-based
[4246.32 - 4253.20] keto that plant-based high-fat right
[4249.52 - 4256.64] you can do okay long enough right
[4253.20 - 4258.32] but if you do get sick or you do
[4256.64 - 4260.00] get to a place where things are starting
[4258.32 - 4261.04] to fall apart and happen it's because
[4260.00 - 4263.36] the fats aren't
[4261.04 - 4265.04] allowing the body to heal with what's
[4263.36 - 4266.64] behind the problem which is
[4265.04 - 4268.64] the pathogens the epstein bar the
[4266.64 - 4270.32] shingles the cytomegalovirus you know
[4268.64 - 4271.76] most people walking around they got all
[4270.32 - 4272.96] these bugs in them they'll have two
[4271.76 - 4274.88] varieties of shingles
[4272.96 - 4276.16] three varieties of streptococcus two
[4274.88 - 4278.72] varieties of epstein-barr
[4276.16 - 4279.84] and they'll have that inside them and
[4278.72 - 4281.12] that's how it works
[4279.84 - 4283.84] so i'm letting this cool down it's
[4281.12 - 4283.84] starting to come out
[4283.92 - 4289.36] it's peeling it back a little bit more
[4285.76 - 4289.36] from the paper from parchment paper
[4289.52 - 4291.84] all right
[4292.64 - 4296.32] still cooling down a little bit so
[4298.64 - 4304.64] there you go but
[4302.64 - 4305.68] i like making meals that are fat free
[4304.64 - 4307.36] because i know
[4305.68 - 4309.36] everybody's gonna eat the fat i can't
[4307.36 - 4311.28] stop you i can't stop anybody
[4309.36 - 4313.36] they're just gonna do it i got friends
[4311.28 - 4315.92] where like i'll teach them how to heal
[4313.36 - 4318.24] you know and then they're still having
[4315.92 - 4320.48] their vegan pizza or something else
[4318.24 - 4322.00] and that's what they'll do elena said i
[4320.48 - 4324.00] had ocd
[4322.00 - 4325.60] and after medical medium protocol i
[4324.00 - 4328.32] don't really have it anymore
[4325.60 - 4329.44] and i had it for four years that's
[4328.32 - 4332.56] incredible
[4329.44 - 4333.96] i remember i put an ocd post out and i
[4332.56 - 4338.24] got slammed
[4333.96 - 4340.48] slammed by the ocd community
[4338.24 - 4341.60] and they were all upset that there was
[4340.48 - 4343.36] an answer
[4341.60 - 4344.88] they were mad that there was an answer
[4343.36 - 4348.56] toxic heavy metals
[4344.88 - 4352.08] and they were angry that there was
[4348.56 - 4353.92] an answer you know the ocd community
[4352.08 - 4355.28] it was like they were just it was
[4353.92 - 4356.64] unbelievable what happened and i'm like
[4355.28 - 4358.00] wait a minute are you really suffering
[4356.64 - 4359.44] from ocd because if you're really
[4358.00 - 4360.56] suffering from ocd you're going to want
[4359.44 - 4361.44] an answer and you're going to want to
[4360.56 - 4362.80] heal
[4361.44 - 4364.72] so now i'm starting to wonder wait a
[4362.80 - 4365.84] minute are the is the ocd community that
[4364.72 - 4368.48] was attacking me
[4365.84 - 4369.36] were they really those people with ocd
[4368.48 - 4370.88] because
[4369.36 - 4372.64] i've known a lot of people over the
[4370.88 - 4374.64] years at ocd they're just like what do
[4372.64 - 4376.24] we need to do because this ocd is so
[4374.64 - 4377.60] brutal i'll be like great let's get out
[4376.24 - 4380.00] the toxic heavy metals
[4377.60 - 4381.60] and let's heal and then they heal and
[4380.00 - 4383.60] it's such a nice thing to see
