[107.88 - 113.28] in your life and and that's that's
[111.00 - 115.96] important you know if this is your first
[113.28 - 117.72] time joining my webinar or heard a radio
[115.96 - 119.68] show or read any books or anything of
[117.72 - 122.64] mine please know that I dedicated my
[119.68 - 125.92] life life to provide real answers for
[122.64 - 128.92] countless people for decades and much of
[125.92 - 130.80] the information has been proven over the
[128.92 - 132.40] years as the years have gone by it's
[130.80 - 134.60] been proven even by science of
[132.40 - 136.92] information that have brought to the
[134.60 - 139.52] table and so much of it that I've
[136.92 - 141.96] brought for us hasn't been yet
[139.52 - 144.36] discovered by research or science and
[141.96 - 147.12] it's still years years down the road in
[144.36 - 149.04] ahead but I always want you to have that
[147.12 - 151.40] information now I don't want you waiting
[149.04 - 153.76] it doesn't make any sense to wait you
[151.40 - 157.88] know and there's something important for
[153.76 - 160.00] you to know is as you listen you may see
[157.88 - 163.32] that sometimes this information that I'm
[160.00 - 166.44] sharing with you will seem the like the
[163.32 - 167.72] opposite of what you've heard before
[166.44 - 169.28] when it comes down to Something in
[167.72 - 171.60] health or something in cancer or
[169.28 - 174.72] something like that but don't be alarmed
[171.60 - 177.36] there could be good reason and very good
[174.72 - 180.16] reason why it's the opposite to protect
[177.36 - 182.32] you so keep that in mind as you're
[180.16 - 185.08] listening to this and going through this
[182.32 - 187.56] and sometimes you'll notice that the
[185.08 - 191.80] information could be similar to other
[187.56 - 194.92] sources but there's subtle and different
[191.80 - 196.56] critical differences that make the
[194.92 - 198.36] difference there's critical differences
[196.56 - 199.80] in the information and you might not be
[198.36 - 201.56] able to see that right off the bat and
[199.80 - 203.44] say oh well oh god I've heard that
[201.56 - 205.76] before no there could be a subtle
[203.44 - 207.48] critical difference because it matters
[205.76 - 210.28] because information as it goes down the
[207.48 - 213.48] line gets messed with
[210.28 - 215.52] as it goes down the line the Common
[213.48 - 219.00] Thread with the information you're going
[215.52 - 220.36] to get today is that it's the truth and
[219.00 - 222.36] I'm not talking about truth that has
[220.36 - 224.20] been altered truth that has been tainted
[222.36 - 226.80] truth that has been
[224.20 - 229.12] skewed along the way I'm not talking
[226.80 - 231.12] about that kind of truth that even the
[229.12 - 232.64] best the best well-known experts are
[231.12 - 234.64] speaking out there but don't realize
[232.64 - 236.72] there's something in there that's not in
[234.64 - 238.36] your best interest the information
[236.72 - 241.80] you're going to get is not
[238.36 - 243.96] repackaged and it's not recycled Theory
[241.80 - 246.12] made to sound like something new you
[243.96 - 248.48] know this this information you'll hear
[246.12 - 250.40] doesn't come from interest groups
[248.48 - 253.76] medical funding with strings attached
[250.40 - 257.52] botched research lobbyists internal
[253.76 - 260.52] Kickbacks yeah persuaded belief
[257.52 - 263.76] systems and private panels of
[260.52 - 267.48] influencers and health PE health field
[263.76 - 270.68] payoffs or even trendy traps that are
[267.48 - 272.92] both in conven
[270.68 - 276.44] and alternative medicine that are both
[272.92 - 279.04] in conventional and alternative me
[276.44 - 280.68] medicine seriously you know when I say
[279.04 - 282.80] that I still can't even believe it but
[280.68 - 286.16] it's true and I've seen it and I've seen
[282.80 - 288.64] it over again this information I'm
[286.16 - 291.12] sharing with you is in your best
[288.64 - 293.72] interest you need to know that that's
[291.12 - 296.08] important it's in no one else's best
[293.72 - 297.68] interest it's not in any of those groups
[296.08 - 299.08] I just mentioned okay it's very
[297.68 - 300.64] important because those groups come
[299.08 - 303.16] along with with even the best
[300.64 - 306.40] alternative information that people and
[303.16 - 308.36] experts are sharing and it doesn't mean
[306.40 - 310.28] it's in your best interest anymore even
[308.36 - 312.32] though the heart's all there and it's
[310.28 - 314.12] all there in the sense of you know the
[312.32 - 316.64] the inspiration is all there the passion
[314.12 - 319.60] someone could have behind it best your
[316.64 - 321.48] best interest matters see the
[319.60 - 324.32] information you're going to get here
[321.48 - 327.32] comes from a clean Source a Pure
[324.32 - 331.40] untampered Source that I've been blessed
[327.32 - 333.24] with and have had access to since Age 4
[331.40 - 334.92] a higher source a compassionate source
[333.24 - 337.12] that many of you have learned through
[334.92 - 339.76] reading my books or have heard or
[337.12 - 342.48] experienced oneon-one with me all
[339.76 - 345.64] through the years okay so fasten your
[342.48 - 348.20] seat bels and I hope you enjoy the show
[345.64 - 350.60] and I mean fasten those seat bels for
[348.20 - 354.40] really because we're going for a ride
[350.60 - 357.04] we're going for a ride many people have
[354.40 - 358.72] recently been asking me a lot you know
[357.04 - 360.12] what what are my thoughts about cancer
[358.72 - 362.36] you know I see it all over the place a
[360.12 - 364.48] lot of people ask me in different you
[362.36 - 366.28] know ways and online and everything else
[364.48 - 368.76] what do you know what do I know about
[366.28 - 372.04] cancer and what are my thoughts about
[368.76 - 374.12] cancer well you know so it was time that
[372.04 - 376.16] I actually I actually covered this like
[374.12 - 377.96] I've covered dozens and dozens of
[376.16 - 380.24] ailments and different you know
[377.96 - 382.84] illnesses and diseases and conditions
[380.24 - 385.00] with Advanced information I think it's
[382.84 - 387.52] important to just you know get some
[385.00 - 389.20] cancer information out there too uh that
[387.52 - 390.92] could look be additionally helpful for
[389.20 - 393.20] the information that's already out there
[390.92 - 396.44] in the world either way but it's
[393.20 - 399.20] important information and my personal
[396.44 - 400.88] experience with cancer you guys started
[399.20 - 402.72] at age four when I discovered my
[400.88 - 404.84] grandmother had lung cancer so I was the
[402.72 - 407.20] one and actually saw that she had lung
[404.84 - 409.56] cancer and many of you probably know
[407.20 - 411.40] that story and how it went but it but
[409.56 - 412.68] that was my first personal experience
[411.40 - 415.80] and since then though through the
[412.68 - 417.56] decades I've actually seen cancer in so
[415.80 - 419.08] many different people cancer that has
[417.56 - 421.96] developed in so many different people
[419.08 - 424.12] along Ong the way and I've taken it
[421.96 - 427.48] extremely personal because of my
[424.12 - 430.44] grandmother number one and number two
[427.48 - 432.92] because of the nature of it and what we
[430.44 - 437.08] go through in health and everything else
[432.92 - 439.44] so I'm going to provide key pieces to
[437.08 - 443.48] cancer that you should know and of
[439.44 - 447.00] course Epstein bar which has a reason
[443.48 - 448.88] for why we're doing that today too which
[447.00 - 452.48] you'll you'll you'll figure out out
[448.88 - 454.28] along the way as we talk about it and so
[452.48 - 456.36] we're taking this serious today we
[454.28 - 459.04] really are cancer and EBV cancer and
[456.36 - 461.08] epsteam bar we're taking this serious
[459.04 - 463.56] you know so when I diagnosed my
[461.08 - 467.68] grandmother of lung cancer at age 4 I've
[463.56 - 469.80] seen a lot of people just in as a child
[467.68 - 473.04] I'd be in a busy place or being a movie
[469.80 - 475.44] theater and be able to know if someone
[473.04 - 477.16] had cancer in the movie theater and
[475.44 - 479.80] whatever kind of cancer and variety of
[477.16 - 482.00] cancer now the good thing about the gift
[479.80 - 486.24] the wonderful good thing about the gift
[482.00 - 489.32] that I've been given is you get to know
[486.24 - 492.88] what's behind the cancer what's really
[489.32 - 496.92] the starting point when did it start how
[492.88 - 499.68] did it start in someone what was it see
[496.92 - 501.92] medicine today you guys medicine today
[499.68 - 504.04] just focuses on cancer once it's been
[501.92 - 505.84] created once something's been created
[504.04 - 508.32] once something's developed and
[505.84 - 511.44] manifested that's what cancer research
[508.32 - 513.48] is about it's about that point cancer
[511.44 - 515.72] research really isn't about anything
[513.48 - 517.72] before that and if it is it's about
[515.72 - 519.76] something entirely wrong which we're
[517.72 - 521.48] going to talk about and I could say that
[519.76 - 523.92] and it's going to be a mindblower that
[521.48 - 525.68] there's a fa there's a piece of fabric
[523.92 - 527.16] about the study of cancer today that
[525.68 - 531.68] isn't really
[527.16 - 534.40] correct and so the the information has
[531.68 - 536.32] to be out there about really how does it
[534.40 - 540.52] start how can a cancer cell become a
[536.32 - 543.68] cancer cell how can a cancer cell grow
[540.52 - 546.00] how and what and why what's really going
[543.68 - 548.40] on and that's what we're talking about
[546.00 - 551.04] today I mean we only have a certain
[548.40 - 553.20] amount of time of course so I can't go
[551.04 - 555.20] on and on and on about hundreds of
[553.20 - 556.60] different varieties of cancer and all
[555.20 - 558.60] the different research that's out there
[556.60 - 560.12] today and the whole bit and we'll do
[558.60 - 561.72] more of these we're going to do more of
[560.12 - 563.48] these along the way so we cover more and
[561.72 - 567.20] more but we're going to cover key
[563.48 - 569.56] critical critical points that are so
[567.20 - 571.92] important and information that is so
[569.56 - 573.28] important so I just want to give you
[571.92 - 576.32] that whole
[573.28 - 579.08] background now let's go into history
[576.32 - 580.40] just a little bit now there I'm sure
[579.08 - 582.28] there's some cancer experts that are
[580.40 - 583.96] actually just listening to this for sure
[582.28 - 585.28] now and different Physicians and
[583.96 - 586.76] different professionals and different
[585.28 - 588.72] people all around and people that aren't
[586.76 - 590.36] even doctors that are that are experts
[588.72 - 591.84] in cancer because they've experienced it
[590.36 - 593.68] or they've known somebody or anything
[591.84 - 595.64] like that or they just researching
[593.68 - 597.96] constantly and I get that so if you know
[595.64 - 602.44] some research you know that cancer we've
[597.96 - 605.04] been told cancer goes back a long way it
[602.44 - 607.52] goes back years and years and years and
[605.04 - 610.64] years before us so that's what we've
[607.52 - 613.80] been told Cancer's it's really old it's
[610.64 - 615.36] old in our history it goes back farther
[613.80 - 618.20] and further like for instance you may
[615.36 - 619.76] hear that cancer is a thousand years old
[618.20 - 621.56] and then you may hear that there's
[619.76 - 624.80] people with cancer that you know are
[621.56 - 627.72] 2,000 years ago maybe they found a mummy
[624.80 - 630.16] with cancer okay and then you may hear
[627.72 - 634.40] that just 500 years ago
[630.16 - 637.44] okay or you know go back to 400 BC all
[634.40 - 640.00] right when the word cancer was was
[637.44 - 642.36] created it's a Greek word so that word
[640.00 - 645.20] was created that's a Greek word cancer
[642.36 - 647.32] for a sickness in the body so you would
[645.20 - 651.16] think well cancer started really early
[647.32 - 654.80] because 400 BC that's when cancer first
[651.16 - 656.88] started so and you're going to hear
[654.80 - 660.48] eventually and you're going to hear
[656.88 - 663.12] eventually that you know and I ican an
[660.48 - 665.56] ican has cancer and they got it under
[663.12 - 668.96] study you know somebody they found in
[665.56 - 671.56] ice 10,000 years ago 12,000 years ago
[668.96 - 673.80] next to a mammoth and they're going to
[671.56 - 675.76] say well you know science research going
[673.80 - 678.24] to say well cancer goes back as far as
[675.76 - 679.40] woo the time of the mammoths and you're
[678.24 - 681.92] going to hear
[679.40 - 685.80] that but I have to be straight with you
[681.92 - 687.28] guys I have to be straight up all right
[685.80 - 689.28] and remember I told you to fast of no
[687.28 - 691.92] seat belts there's reason for this for
[689.28 - 696.36] this trip for this ride there's
[691.92 - 700.84] reasons see we've been had that's
[696.36 - 702.96] misinformation cancer is Young extremely
[700.84 - 706.48] young in history and I'm going to talk
[702.96 - 708.56] about how and why and what see you have
[706.48 - 711.68] to understand something when the term
[708.56 - 713.80] cancer in 400 BC around 400 BC they're
[711.68 - 716.56] around that time frame when the Greeks
[713.80 - 718.96] came up with the term cancer they were
[716.56 - 721.16] talking about a tumor but they weren't
[718.96 - 724.20] w't talking about cancer cells in a
[721.16 - 727.52] tumor they weren't talking about
[724.20 - 731.08] malignant cancer cells in a tumor that
[727.52 - 733.68] word was developed for benign
[731.08 - 736.36] tumors for benign
[733.68 - 738.32] tumors that's where that word was
[736.36 - 741.52] developed it was also developed off of
[738.32 - 744.32] Just sickness that grew whether it even
[741.52 - 747.88] wasn't a tumor it didn't even have to be
[744.32 - 750.68] a tumor for that word to be used when it
[747.88 - 752.84] was first invented is first first that
[750.68 - 755.04] word was first you know
[752.84 - 757.84] pronounced so that means if someone was
[755.04 - 761.12] dying of some type of toxin or illness
[757.84 - 764.76] or something back you know over 2,000
[761.12 - 765.96] years ago the word cancer was applied
[764.76 - 770.20] all the
[765.96 - 773.64] time all of the time it was applied
[770.20 - 776.32] tumor no tumor um being able to see a
[773.64 - 778.28] disease or not it was applied so you
[776.32 - 779.72] need to understand that this is really
[778.28 - 783.96] important
[779.72 - 788.80] okay any kind of tumors that were even
[783.96 - 791.52] found in the 1400s 1500s 1600s weren't
[788.80 - 794.28] cancerous could they have killed someone
[791.52 - 798.00] yes growing the wrong way growing in the
[794.28 - 800.32] wrong place absolutely growing up
[798.00 - 802.88] against an organ pushing up against a
[800.32 - 805.32] vein pushing up is very easy back in
[802.88 - 806.52] that day for anything to pretty much
[805.32 - 809.52] take you
[806.52 - 810.32] out and but
[809.52 - 814.72] these
[810.32 - 819.40] tumors weren't the cancer we speak of we
[814.72 - 821.92] see we talk about today at all now why
[819.40 - 824.04] is this why isn't this corrected
[821.92 - 826.12] anywhere why isn't this corrected with
[824.04 - 828.16] the experts why aren't they correcting
[826.12 - 830.04] it because they don't know better I'm
[828.16 - 832.16] sorry to say and there's a reason for
[830.04 - 834.72] this it's not their fault not their
[832.16 - 837.96] fault at all the reason why no one's
[834.72 - 841.64] corrected with this is because medicine
[837.96 - 845.00] today has to put the blame on you it has
[841.64 - 847.68] to put the blame on you you need to know
[845.00 - 851.04] that's how it's all been set up okay and
[847.68 - 853.80] hang on hang on hang on this is going to
[851.04 - 856.68] be okay get some tea out get some tea
[853.80 - 859.08] out okay maybe some some lemon balm tea
[856.68 - 861.28] or some relaxing tea because this is
[859.08 - 862.60] hard this is hard to digest maybe some
[861.28 - 865.12] peppermint tea cuz with you know it
[862.60 - 867.76] helps you digest food so we'll get the
[865.12 - 869.32] helps your digestion improve we'll get
[867.76 - 872.76] some peppermint tea
[869.32 - 874.00] out see the fault has to be put on you
[872.76 - 876.40] same thing I talk about all the time
[874.00 - 879.04] with autoimmune disease we're we're told
[876.40 - 881.44] that the body is attacking itself that
[879.04 - 883.40] the body literally is destroying itself
[881.44 - 885.84] with any kind of autoimmune disease
[883.40 - 887.20] that's incorrect information as I've
[885.84 - 890.56] talked about many times there's
[887.20 - 892.52] pathogens that are the cause of the
[890.56 - 895.28] damage being done or the inflammation
[892.52 - 898.44] that's occurring the body produces an
[895.28 - 900.12] antibody not to destroy the body or hurt
[898.44 - 902.96] the body body on any level but to go
[900.12 - 904.80] after the virus it's not autoimmune see
[902.96 - 906.96] that part isn't even corrected yet but
[904.80 - 908.68] the blame is always it's not corrected
[906.96 - 910.04] out there except I was the first person
[908.68 - 912.60] to actually get it out there now it's
[910.04 - 915.80] starting to get out there thank God and
[912.60 - 919.92] it will be proven I promise you this but
[915.80 - 923.28] the point is is for you to believe that
[919.92 - 924.88] it's always your fault so no matter what
[923.28 - 927.40] so whatever kind of chronic fatigue or
[924.88 - 932.64] sickness or disease or illness or rash
[927.40 - 934.76] or disord order it's it's it's just you
[932.64 - 937.20] and this is how it's always been set up
[934.76 - 940.36] so if the truth came out the real truth
[937.20 - 943.04] and you knew that you weren't
[940.36 - 945.84] responsible for your cancer or cancer
[943.04 - 947.72] just didn't afflict you it didn't
[945.84 - 949.64] naturally afflict you just came on to
[947.72 - 950.92] you because that's the way it's been for
[949.64 - 953.72] thousands of years which is the wrong
[950.92 - 957.20] information if you knew the truth that
[953.72 - 959.08] it was somebody else's fault and if the
[957.20 - 962.52] world knew that things would start
[959.08 - 965.24] falling apart the things would start
[962.52 - 967.96] falling apart in medicine and research
[965.24 - 969.36] and everything else so the pattern for
[967.96 - 972.00] medicine is always going to be heading
[969.36 - 974.88] in the direction it's your fault you got
[972.00 - 977.56] bad genes your body's attacking itself
[974.88 - 980.52] and destroying itself you're creating
[977.56 - 982.56] your problem you're eating too much
[980.52 - 985.12] you're not taking care of yourself
[982.56 - 987.52] you're doing whatever whatever it is
[985.12 - 990.68] it's going to point there in
[987.52 - 995.20] medicine but with
[990.68 - 997.44] cancer Cancer's an early epidemic really
[995.20 - 999.40] early I mean not early start just
[997.44 - 1001.88] recently early is what I mean that's
[999.40 - 1004.04] what I'm trying to say here it's
[1001.88 - 1007.68] recent it's
[1004.04 - 1011.60] recent and it's not as far back going
[1007.68 - 1014.00] all the way as we think it is so when
[1011.60 - 1016.92] did the first real cancer start to
[1014.00 - 1019.32] develop into cancer meaning it left just
[1016.92 - 1022.36] the word itself and turned into a
[1019.32 - 1025.04] malignant cell a cancerous cell a cell
[1022.36 - 1026.68] that became destructive or a tumor that
[1025.04 - 1030.96] became filled with malignant cells and
[1026.68 - 1032.80] so forth when did that all start right
[1030.96 - 1035.20] in the late
[1032.80 - 1037.68] 1700s the late
[1035.20 - 1041.20] 1700s that's when the first cancer
[1037.68 - 1043.16] started that alone is important to
[1041.20 - 1047.40] understand for so many reasons that's
[1043.16 - 1050.52] when the first cancer started and those
[1047.40 - 1053.32] cancers weren't the cancers we're
[1050.52 - 1054.28] dealing with now today they weren't
[1053.32 - 1058.24] those
[1054.28 - 1061.36] cancers they weren't in fact in the late
[1058.24 - 1063.92] very late 1700s there was only basically
[1061.36 - 1068.36] one variety of cancer
[1063.92 - 1073.32] docile slow to the punch not problematic
[1068.36 - 1076.44] barely problematic and then by the 1830s
[1073.32 - 1079.00] 1840s a couple of other cancer varieties
[1076.44 - 1081.68] stemmed from it still
[1079.00 - 1082.80] doile but a little bit more aggressive a
[1081.68 - 1085.96] little bit more
[1082.80 - 1089.32] worse the first cancer started around
[1085.96 - 1092.56] the Industrial Revolution the Industrial
[1089.32 - 1095.60] Revolution which gave that was the birth
[1092.56 - 1100.44] of chemistry that was the birth of the
[1095.60 - 1103.32] chemical world this is when cancer
[1100.44 - 1105.44] started understand that it started when
[1103.32 - 1106.76] man started playing with chemicals
[1105.44 - 1109.04] started playing with chemicals in the
[1106.76 - 1112.48] lab chemistry
[1109.04 - 1115.76] that's when it first started and those
[1112.48 - 1118.84] chemicals were were created and worked
[1115.76 - 1121.44] on and being the chemical world was
[1118.84 - 1124.64] being built the industrial world was
[1121.44 - 1127.60] being built we were burning things in
[1124.64 - 1130.48] the air we never burnt before we were
[1127.60 - 1133.16] playing with different things we were
[1130.48 - 1135.12] synthesizing synthesizing different
[1133.16 - 1137.16] things different chemical compounds
[1135.12 - 1140.20] different agents that we were we were
[1137.16 - 1143.24] playing with we were mixing
[1140.20 - 1145.88] metals and we were learning how to use
[1143.24 - 1147.60] chemistry for the first time in history
[1145.88 - 1149.68] really learning how to use chemistry for
[1147.60 - 1152.00] the first time in in history and we are
[1149.68 - 1154.92] learning how to do things with it we are
[1152.00 - 1157.64] learning how to play with metal with it
[1154.92 - 1161.60] to change the structure of
[1157.64 - 1164.84] metals and to even do more than that and
[1161.60 - 1166.48] we were burning chemicals and burning
[1164.84 - 1169.96] them and they weren't the chemicals we
[1166.48 - 1173.20] have today which is why the
[1169.96 - 1174.64] cancers weren't so bad the cancers
[1173.20 - 1177.24] weren't so bad at this point now of
[1174.64 - 1178.72] course in the in the you know 1700s and
[1177.24 - 1180.36] 1800s we had all kinds of different
[1178.72 - 1181.92] tumors and we had different varieties of
[1180.36 - 1183.72] tumors and they were getting worse
[1181.92 - 1187.08] benign tumors different illnesses
[1183.72 - 1189.40] different sicknesses to that point but
[1187.08 - 1192.88] cancer itself cancer itself and the
[1189.40 - 1196.08] cells of cancer wasn't in its you know
[1192.88 - 1199.64] great day at that point at all but it's
[1196.08 - 1201.56] the birth of the basically the
[1199.64 - 1203.64] industries it was the birth of the
[1201.56 - 1204.52] chemical playing around with chemicals
[1203.64 - 1208.40] and the
[1204.52 - 1211.88] industries okay and here's the deal now
[1208.40 - 1213.48] as we go today now where we are today
[1211.88 - 1215.96] there are a lot of different varieties
[1213.48 - 1217.72] of cancers now we know that you know
[1215.96 - 1221.60] that not telling you anything
[1217.72 - 1223.32] new and but what there is there's a lot
[1221.60 - 1227.72] of different
[1223.32 - 1231.80] variations of why someone gets a cancer
[1227.72 - 1234.16] to what degree they get a cancer to what
[1231.80 - 1238.64] degree so all kinds of different
[1234.16 - 1240.44] variables lots of them okay now science
[1238.64 - 1242.76] and research doesn't care about the
[1240.44 - 1244.56] variables so Medical Science medical
[1242.76 - 1246.48] research doesn't care about all those
[1244.56 - 1249.68] they don't care about all the different
[1246.48 - 1251.72] variables we're not there yet you know
[1249.68 - 1255.24] as far as science and research goes no
[1251.72 - 1258.72] one cares about all the different
[1255.24 - 1261.00] reasons someone gets a certain cancer
[1258.72 - 1264.24] and someone else doesn't or someone gets
[1261.00 - 1265.84] a certain variety of a mutated version
[1264.24 - 1270.00] of a Cancer and someone doesn't or
[1265.84 - 1272.68] someone gets sick in a certain way with
[1270.00 - 1275.12] the cancer like someone it kills someone
[1272.68 - 1277.88] but doesn't kill another person all
[1275.12 - 1280.28] these different variables and there's so
[1277.88 - 1283.60] many in the mix and to what degree
[1280.28 - 1287.80] someone gets cancer and who gets the
[1283.60 - 1291.92] cancer and because the reason why it's
[1287.80 - 1294.72] all all Man Behind cancer to begin with
[1291.92 - 1296.40] I'm not talking about uh any bad people
[1294.72 - 1298.40] you know that are trying to help people
[1296.40 - 1300.12] and help care people of cancer and help
[1298.40 - 1301.84] I'm not talking about that I'm talking
[1300.12 - 1304.36] about I'm talking about all the
[1301.84 - 1307.68] different things created of why we deal
[1304.36 - 1310.08] with cancer now exposure talking about
[1307.68 - 1313.40] solvents all the different solvents were
[1310.08 - 1315.40] exposed to all the time and the chemical
[1313.40 - 1318.28] agents all the different chemical agents
[1315.40 - 1320.16] were were thousands of chemical agents
[1318.28 - 1321.52] all the different pesticides herbicides
[1320.16 - 1324.88] fungicides
[1321.52 - 1326.44] rodenticides um insecticides whatever
[1324.88 - 1329.72] all those different
[1326.44 - 1332.40] ones radiation exposure not just
[1329.72 - 1334.24] radiation different types of radiation
[1332.40 - 1338.40] different types of radiation exposure
[1334.24 - 1343.84] all the time and that's just a fraction
[1338.40 - 1347.72] of it then there's something else see
[1343.84 - 1350.44] someone has to have two things there has
[1347.72 - 1353.36] to be two things that someone has to
[1350.44 - 1355.52] have in their body to create the
[1353.36 - 1360.40] possibility of cancer there has to be
[1355.52 - 1362.28] two things in someone's body you guys to
[1360.40 - 1363.48] create cancer even though there's all
[1362.28 - 1364.84] these different solvents and these
[1363.48 - 1366.72] different agents and different heavy
[1364.84 - 1368.72] metals different pesticides different
[1366.72 - 1370.72] radiations varieties of radiation
[1368.72 - 1372.88] different um you know
[1370.72 - 1373.96] nanotechnology and everything else even
[1372.88 - 1375.40] though that's all there there's
[1373.96 - 1376.96] chemicals falling out of the sky even
[1375.40 - 1379.84] though that's all
[1376.96 - 1381.56] there there has to be two things that's
[1379.84 - 1383.72] one thing that's one group that's one
[1381.56 - 1387.60] thing but you have to have something
[1383.72 - 1390.64] else you have to have a virus you have
[1387.60 - 1394.12] to have a viral nature inside the body
[1390.64 - 1398.00] it has to be a virus inside the body or
[1394.12 - 1400.80] viruses inside the body so there are two
[1398.00 - 1404.12] things someone has to have in order to
[1400.80 - 1407.28] create cancer two things they have to
[1404.12 - 1410.24] have chemical agent of some kind which
[1407.28 - 1414.40] is a toxic of some kind and they have to
[1410.24 - 1416.52] have a virus that's the two things and
[1414.40 - 1419.40] then you got the possibility of possible
[1416.52 - 1421.16] cancer you know and if you know unless
[1419.40 - 1423.52] you do things like get toxins out of the
[1421.16 - 1425.44] body unless you do things like knock any
[1423.52 - 1427.96] viruses down then you then you never get
[1425.44 - 1430.12] cancer even if you have the virus and
[1427.96 - 1433.12] the toxins if but if they get out of
[1430.12 - 1435.52] control more tox toxins accumulate more
[1433.12 - 1438.24] toxins build up more toxins you know
[1435.52 - 1439.72] pile on top of it of itself and build up
[1438.24 - 1442.04] in different organs different places of
[1439.72 - 1444.16] the body and the brain and the and even
[1442.04 - 1445.44] the stomach stomach holds so many toxins
[1444.16 - 1447.28] it goes into the lining of the stomach
[1445.44 - 1451.04] wherever these toxins are liver
[1447.28 - 1453.72] everywhere pancreas you name it and then
[1451.04 - 1455.92] the virus the virus is is is increasing
[1453.72 - 1459.08] in numbers if it's proliferating if it's
[1455.92 - 1460.84] growing and that's the other factor it's
[1459.08 - 1462.84] these two
[1460.84 - 1464.16] things and that's the difference of what
[1462.84 - 1466.76] you're going to hear there's another
[1464.16 - 1468.68] difference all in its own so there has
[1466.76 - 1470.72] to be a toxin there has to be a virus
[1468.68 - 1473.60] the variations are endless though to
[1470.72 - 1476.56] what virus and what virus
[1473.60 - 1479.32] strain the variations are endless to
[1476.56 - 1482.32] what virus and what virus strain and is
[1479.32 - 1483.20] the virus mutated what kind of virus is
[1482.32 - 1486.88] it
[1483.20 - 1489.40] mutated and how many toxins someone has
[1486.88 - 1491.28] do they just have a few heavy metals and
[1489.40 - 1493.32] a little bit of radiation do they have
[1491.28 - 1495.16] different varieties of of of you know do
[1493.32 - 1497.72] they have all kinds of different
[1495.16 - 1499.36] things did they have you know carpet
[1497.72 - 1502.36] chemicals you know going through their
[1499.36 - 1504.64] body you know from from carpet cleaning
[1502.36 - 1507.48] services are they getting their home
[1504.64 - 1510.72] sprayed are they eating only
[1507.48 - 1513.76] conventional produce Non-Stop and only
[1510.72 - 1515.52] that but if that if someone H has to be
[1513.76 - 1518.48] forced to eat conventional produce
[1515.52 - 1520.56] non-stop I understand you know it's more
[1518.48 - 1521.84] affordable in so many ways for so many
[1520.56 - 1523.44] people but there's things you could do
[1521.84 - 1524.96] to still clean up the pesticides while
[1523.44 - 1528.12] you have to eat that way and you're
[1524.96 - 1531.80] still getting benefits from those Foods
[1528.12 - 1534.08] that help counter that but the bottom
[1531.80 - 1537.16] line is and what I'm trying to say is
[1534.08 - 1539.68] the endless variations and then how
[1537.16 - 1543.24] strong the person's immune system is so
[1539.68 - 1546.36] how strong the person's immune system is
[1543.24 - 1549.64] matters too that makes a huge difference
[1546.36 - 1553.40] so each person is different everybody's
[1549.64 - 1555.36] different okay everybody's different
[1553.40 - 1558.84] someone can smoke
[1555.36 - 1560.00] cigarettes for 50 years and not develop
[1558.84 - 1565.16] lung
[1560.00 - 1567.68] cancer someone could never smoke
[1565.16 - 1570.40] ever but they happen to breathe in a lot
[1567.68 - 1571.76] of hairspray over the years over the
[1570.40 - 1574.52] decades you know to try to get their
[1571.76 - 1575.88] hair looking prettier a certain way so
[1574.52 - 1577.80] they just spray and
[1575.88 - 1579.76] hairspray and someone breathe in
[1577.80 - 1583.20] Hairspray and for some reason they get
[1579.76 - 1586.64] lung cancer someone not spraying
[1583.20 - 1588.28] anything gets lung cancer and didn't
[1586.64 - 1590.72] smoke a day in their life
[1588.28 - 1593.84] life I mean I've seen people smoke a
[1590.72 - 1598.84] lifetime not get lung cancer and not get
[1593.84 - 1601.20] any cancer any cancer because one of
[1598.84 - 1603.48] those things that I talked about the two
[1601.20 - 1606.44] things one of those things wasn't
[1603.48 - 1608.40] there it wasn't there apparently they
[1606.44 - 1612.40] had the they had the toxins they were
[1608.40 - 1614.04] able to smoke for 50 years 60 years 70
[1612.40 - 1616.60] years they had the
[1614.04 - 1618.24] toxins that's the one thing remember and
[1616.60 - 1621.04] the other thing
[1618.24 - 1623.48] the viruses they didn't have they didn't
[1621.04 - 1626.80] have the viruses they didn't have a
[1623.48 - 1629.20] virus that's why old man Johnson never
[1626.80 - 1633.00] got lung cancer and never
[1629.20 - 1636.16] died that's why old lady McFarland she
[1633.00 - 1638.72] never died she she
[1636.16 - 1643.00] smoked maybe she got a little something
[1638.72 - 1643.00] else maybe she got COPD when she's
[1643.16 - 1649.00] 92 but but the Cancer's not there and
[1647.04 - 1650.12] I've seen that I mean I've seen that for
[1649.00 - 1652.56] decades
[1650.12 - 1655.20] happen because there has to be two
[1652.56 - 1658.56] things there has to be two things and
[1655.20 - 1660.40] the variations matter including even
[1658.56 - 1662.88] stress including stress because
[1660.40 - 1665.44] adrenaline doesn't help either
[1662.88 - 1667.32] adrenaline can be really noxious can be
[1665.44 - 1670.88] really
[1667.32 - 1673.32] toxic and really difficult to deal with
[1670.88 - 1676.16] cancer research like I said is based on
[1673.32 - 1678.52] cancer that's manifested already it's it
[1676.16 - 1681.44] that's what it's really based on
[1678.52 - 1683.32] it it it always has been it's about okay
[1681.44 - 1685.28] that's it there it is let's biopsy it
[1683.32 - 1688.00] let's cut it out you know let's do what
[1685.28 - 1689.96] we got to do I mean whatever I'm not
[1688.00 - 1692.68] saying that that's bad or good everybody
[1689.96 - 1695.52] has um choices they make and directions
[1692.68 - 1697.60] they go to how they handle a situation
[1695.52 - 1699.20] and how they deal with it and some
[1697.60 - 1701.24] people you know they get surgery some
[1699.20 - 1702.60] people don't some people get chemo some
[1701.24 - 1705.00] people just get radiation there's a
[1702.60 - 1707.96] whole vast differences to how many
[1705.00 - 1709.84] people in what they do and can't clinics
[1707.96 - 1712.12] have gotten a lot better they have
[1709.84 - 1715.00] gotten a lot better it's not like the
[1712.12 - 1716.88] Dark Ages you know and and that's true
[1715.00 - 1719.52] they have improved in so many different
[1716.88 - 1721.56] ways they've reduced and lowered
[1719.52 - 1723.24] variations of chemotherapy they're
[1721.56 - 1724.96] working on targeting targeting what
[1723.24 - 1727.72] chemotherapy works with what cells and
[1724.96 - 1729.36] so forth and so there is there's there's
[1727.72 - 1732.28] definitely differences that have made a
[1729.36 - 1734.52] difference in people's lives and and and
[1732.28 - 1735.88] I stand behind science and research 100%
[1734.52 - 1737.56] you need to know that one of the things
[1735.88 - 1738.88] that happens is when I talk about how
[1737.56 - 1740.72] science research hasn't discovered this
[1738.88 - 1742.16] or they don't understand this or maybe
[1740.72 - 1743.32] something Trinkle on down the line
[1742.16 - 1744.96] that's not in your best interest it
[1743.32 - 1746.96] doesn't mean I don't believe or love
[1744.96 - 1749.52] medical research and Science and I don't
[1746.96 - 1750.88] stand behind it and love the people
[1749.52 - 1754.08] behind it and what they're doing you
[1750.88 - 1755.64] need to know that it's important but but
[1754.08 - 1758.76] you also need to know the other side or
[1755.64 - 1762.12] the piece pieces of it to fill in
[1758.76 - 1764.64] so you know with the pesticides and the
[1762.12 - 1766.80] herbicides and everything else we have
[1764.64 - 1769.08] going on and not just that the different
[1766.80 - 1770.16] metal and all the different toxins and
[1769.08 - 1772.68] the
[1770.16 - 1774.12] solvents that's one aspect of it and
[1772.68 - 1775.68] then you have to have the viral present
[1774.12 - 1778.48] that's act that's the other side of it
[1775.68 - 1781.24] now why why will that create cancer so
[1778.48 - 1784.56] back to this why will that create cancer
[1781.24 - 1788.84] because the virus has to have something
[1784.56 - 1791.28] to feed on it has to have a fuel it has
[1788.84 - 1794.68] to have something it can
[1791.28 - 1798.36] eat something that it can
[1794.68 - 1799.72] consume and you might be a a biologist
[1798.36 - 1801.36] or something right now listening and
[1799.72 - 1804.28] you're like viruses don't eat anything
[1801.36 - 1805.96] no that's not true that's misinformation
[1804.28 - 1809.72] they even teach in
[1805.96 - 1813.28] school viruses eat that's how they
[1809.72 - 1816.04] produce they eat they can't produce if
[1813.28 - 1817.88] they don't get the food they need and if
[1816.04 - 1819.28] you don't have a virus in you then you
[1817.88 - 1822.28] don't have to
[1819.28 - 1823.88] worry I mean but chemicals and harmful
[1822.28 - 1825.20] substances don't do us any good and
[1823.88 - 1826.76] could give us other health conditions
[1825.20 - 1829.08] and problems and cause all kinds of
[1826.76 - 1833.24] variations like tumors that are benign
[1829.08 - 1835.76] like the tumors back in the day in 400
[1833.24 - 1837.32] BC when the word cancer was created and
[1835.76 - 1838.92] it was a benign tumor it wasn't
[1837.32 - 1842.20] cancerous cells that we deal with today
[1838.92 - 1844.92] because that's a new thing new thing in
[1842.20 - 1848.04] history but the but but the benign
[1844.92 - 1851.68] tumors back in 400 BC were filled with
[1848.04 - 1853.56] heavy metals especially back in the day
[1851.68 - 1856.36] in the Rome day in the Greek you know
[1853.56 - 1859.24] all that that day back that time in
[1856.36 - 1861.32] history and Greece all that time in
[1859.24 - 1862.76] history what was going on there was
[1861.32 - 1864.72] heavy metals were saturating the
[1862.76 - 1867.92] waterways everybody was using heavy
[1864.72 - 1870.28] metals like never before in history and
[1867.92 - 1872.56] there were some toxic substances for
[1870.28 - 1874.36] certain varieties of of minerals and and
[1872.56 - 1876.12] chemistry starting nothing like it did
[1874.36 - 1880.44] in the dustrial revolution but it
[1876.12 - 1881.76] created toxic problems such as tumors
[1880.44 - 1884.24] that weren't
[1881.76 - 1887.44] cancerous and those tumors have to feed
[1884.24 - 1889.96] too but cancer cells need they need the
[1887.44 - 1893.20] very toxins I was talking about before
[1889.96 - 1896.80] they need those toxins in order to
[1893.20 - 1900.16] survive in order to eat in order to turn
[1896.80 - 1903.52] into something in order to turn into
[1900.16 - 1905.00] something a virus cell a viral cell is
[1903.52 - 1907.84] not a cancer
[1905.00 - 1912.84] cell it's not a cancer
[1907.84 - 1915.96] cell nope not yet it's not a cancer cell
[1912.84 - 1918.80] so a virus cell has to eat and what it
[1915.96 - 1920.12] does if it's eating a poison it has to
[1918.80 - 1922.48] eliminate it and this is where we're
[1920.12 - 1924.76] going to go into more information so
[1922.48 - 1926.44] fasten your seat bels again I know I
[1924.76 - 1928.52] probably drive you crazy guys with that
[1926.44 - 1930.08] one but you know get ready get your you
[1928.52 - 1933.24] know get your herbal tea out whatever
[1930.08 - 1935.24] you need and the whole bit it's
[1933.24 - 1940.36] important CU we're going in we're going
[1935.24 - 1943.68] into some good stuff here um so a virus
[1940.36 - 1946.80] consumes a toxin a solvent a pesticide a
[1943.68 - 1950.72] heavy metal a plastic a feran a dioxin
[1946.80 - 1954.76] DI dioxins dioxin the age of dioxins is
[1950.72 - 1958.40] upon us that's one of virus's favorite
[1954.76 - 1960.40] foods for cancer producing a dioxin
[1958.40 - 1963.80] itself doesn't
[1960.40 - 1967.00] necessarily create cancer if you
[1963.80 - 1969.44] saturate a rat in the lab with
[1967.00 - 1971.52] dioxins the rat will have viruses
[1969.44 - 1973.32] there's there's no question the rat will
[1971.52 - 1975.60] have viruses within it to feed off the
[1973.32 - 1978.64] dioxin to create a
[1975.60 - 1980.04] cancer so and I mean pesticides like DDT
[1978.64 - 1981.88] too all those are still in our
[1980.04 - 1983.72] environment I talk about that so many
[1981.88 - 1985.16] times and if you you know I can't cover
[1983.72 - 1987.88] everything right now I'd love to talk
[1985.16 - 1989.76] about DDT for an hour I can't you just
[1987.88 - 1993.24] have to keep on looking into all my past
[1989.76 - 1995.28] shows and things I do but but what
[1993.24 - 1998.76] happens is once that virus consumes a
[1995.28 - 2000.60] toxin it remanufactures it's a
[1998.76 - 2004.24] remanufacturing indust industrial
[2000.60 - 2008.80] machine itself is that tiny viral
[2004.24 - 2011.28] cell and it remanu factures the toxin it
[2008.80 - 2014.08] changes the chemical
[2011.28 - 2016.52] compounds of the chemical structure the
[2014.08 - 2018.76] biochemical turns it into a biohazard
[2016.52 - 2022.36] worse than it was originally turns it
[2018.76 - 2024.60] into a biohazard in a worse
[2022.36 - 2027.08] State okay than it originally was to
[2024.60 - 2028.64] begin with and then it releases it into
[2027.08 - 2031.68] the body's
[2028.64 - 2034.04] atmosphere as something far greater in
[2031.68 - 2036.96] strength and
[2034.04 - 2037.88] destructive okay far more aggressive to
[2036.96 - 2042.48] to the
[2037.88 - 2044.44] body this new toxin saturates an area of
[2042.48 - 2048.88] tissue especially if a virus happens to
[2044.44 - 2052.52] be near an area of tissue such as say if
[2048.88 - 2055.44] a virus is near or in the
[2052.52 - 2057.92] thyroid so as it's eating the food it
[2055.44 - 2059.04] wants it releases it so that would be a
[2057.92 - 2063.56] thyroid
[2059.04 - 2068.16] cancer so as it releases the
[2063.56 - 2073.08] toxin in an area a tissue or or um you
[2068.16 - 2079.00] know an organ more cells
[2073.08 - 2081.04] die around it from from that toxin
[2079.00 - 2082.96] because the cells are being poisoned so
[2081.04 - 2086.28] when the virus
[2082.96 - 2090.32] remanufactures and it releases that
[2086.28 - 2093.44] toxin into tissue and this information
[2090.32 - 2096.08] isn't out there this this is a big part
[2093.44 - 2097.52] of the information that's not out there
[2096.08 - 2098.72] and it's important for you to know write
[2097.52 - 2100.44] down your notes cuz I don't want you
[2098.72 - 2104.84] forgetting and I don't want you missing
[2100.44 - 2107.04] out and once that that that toxic
[2104.84 - 2109.32] remanufactured Poison's released back
[2107.04 - 2110.76] into an organ or into some tissue and
[2109.32 - 2112.60] not just floating around the body if
[2110.76 - 2116.28] it's close to an organ or anything like
[2112.60 - 2118.48] that more cells die in that tissue they
[2116.28 - 2121.76] die of a stink of
[2118.48 - 2126.20] death basically what that means is is
[2121.76 - 2129.76] that virus's poison kills cells it kills
[2126.20 - 2131.44] cells those cells actually are dying
[2129.76 - 2134.24] differently than when cells naturally
[2131.44 - 2137.04] die and create toxins so as cells
[2134.24 - 2139.92] naturally die and create toxins in our
[2137.04 - 2141.80] body on a healthy level that's different
[2139.92 - 2144.08] these cells were poisoned to death they
[2141.80 - 2144.96] were living cells and now they're poison
[2144.08 - 2149.00] to
[2144.96 - 2150.72] death and there's a decaying process and
[2149.00 - 2154.04] they're very
[2150.72 - 2155.80] toxic okay and then that that can even
[2154.04 - 2158.52] be released throughout the
[2155.80 - 2160.80] bloodstream which lowers the immune
[2158.52 - 2163.64] system and the immune function which is
[2160.80 - 2166.20] part of all this and a lot of these
[2163.64 - 2168.28] rotting cells can also stay in that
[2166.20 - 2170.64] adjacent area with whether it's in a
[2168.28 - 2174.00] thyroid in an organ or
[2170.64 - 2176.84] anything but these cells have a
[2174.00 - 2178.36] signature attached to them now they have
[2176.84 - 2180.84] a
[2178.36 - 2183.04] signature because of the poison that it
[2180.84 - 2186.04] was that from the virus the virus put a
[2183.04 - 2188.04] chemical compound on these Po in these
[2186.04 - 2189.48] poisons
[2188.04 - 2193.36] and so there's a
[2189.48 - 2197.32] signature these dying decaying cells
[2193.36 - 2201.52] prompt an additional viral response so
[2197.32 - 2202.32] more viruses are coming more viral cells
[2201.52 - 2205.40] are
[2202.32 - 2207.52] coming and when they come these viral
[2205.40 - 2209.44] cells they engage in an area where the
[2207.52 - 2211.08] first viral attack was for instance say
[2209.44 - 2215.24] on a
[2211.08 - 2217.72] thyroid so they engage in that area
[2215.24 - 2220.28] where these first cells were done
[2217.72 - 2222.32] dying the viruses then consume more
[2220.28 - 2223.88] damage dying cells that were first
[2222.32 - 2226.12] contaminated
[2223.88 - 2229.32] originally and they
[2226.12 - 2232.28] remanufacture the toxic dead cell
[2229.32 - 2234.68] material okay now we're remanufacturing
[2232.28 - 2235.48] again we're remanufacturing something
[2234.68 - 2237.76] that was
[2235.48 - 2239.68] remanufactured the poison initially that
[2237.76 - 2241.52] got into the cells that killed it was
[2239.68 - 2244.64] already remanufactured once this is an
[2241.52 - 2248.60] important very important understanding
[2244.64 - 2251.92] but when the virus starts to eat those
[2248.60 - 2254.72] dead decaying cells that have the once
[2251.92 - 2257.64] already remanufactured
[2254.72 - 2260.56] poison the virus remanufactures the
[2257.64 - 2263.80] poison again the living virus cell
[2260.56 - 2265.76] remanufactures the poison again that's
[2263.80 - 2269.04] what it does I'm going to tell you
[2265.76 - 2271.04] that's not good so it remanufactures
[2269.04 - 2273.00] those toxic dead cells this is a process
[2271.04 - 2275.60] that doubles the toxic strength it
[2273.00 - 2277.60] doubles the toxin
[2275.60 - 2280.68] strength
[2277.60 - 2283.20] so as the new viruses digest and release
[2280.68 - 2286.80] the remman once again remanufactured
[2283.20 - 2289.92] poison again it's in double strength
[2286.80 - 2292.68] double trouble it's in double strength
[2289.92 - 2296.00] double in strength it's synthesized like
[2292.68 - 2298.44] a little chemical Factory
[2296.00 - 2300.88] synthesized and just give you an example
[2298.44 - 2302.60] of of when you when you take chemicals
[2300.88 - 2304.64] in their basic structure structures you
[2302.60 - 2306.00] mix them you you spin them you spin them
[2304.64 - 2307.76] in the big Vats in the chemical
[2306.00 - 2309.88] companies I won't name the companies but
[2307.76 - 2312.20] you spin them you work them and you you
[2309.88 - 2313.96] do the whole process and then you take
[2312.20 - 2315.40] that you take a portion of that not all
[2313.96 - 2318.12] of it you take a little portion and you
[2315.40 - 2319.84] add it to another batch and you do this
[2318.12 - 2322.08] whole mixing and every this whole thing
[2319.84 - 2325.52] occurs it's almost like each vat of
[2322.08 - 2327.48] chemicals gobbles up a small amount they
[2325.52 - 2328.88] keep on passing on to the next one and
[2327.48 - 2330.20] it gobbles it up then they take a
[2328.88 - 2332.76] portion of that it's called reverse
[2330.20 - 2334.92] Homeopathy in a way reverse Homeopathy
[2332.76 - 2337.00] for destructive Natures not for healing
[2334.92 - 2339.08] the body but for building destructive
[2337.00 - 2341.00] Warfare chemicals and so forth and and
[2339.08 - 2344.24] insecticides and skull and crossbones
[2341.00 - 2346.20] crap you name it it's that so this is
[2344.24 - 2348.04] kind of like that that's an example it's
[2346.20 - 2350.20] similar in some
[2348.04 - 2353.04] way
[2350.20 - 2355.40] so basically it's like I'm saying it's
[2353.04 - 2357.60] similar to the chemical factors
[2355.40 - 2359.40] factories creating more more potent
[2357.60 - 2361.24] versions of a chemical compound
[2359.40 - 2362.56] synthesizing now if this process
[2361.24 - 2365.24] continues the
[2362.56 - 2367.12] poison gets stronger and stronger it can
[2365.24 - 2368.96] quadruple in strength
[2367.12 - 2370.76] and then get even stronger and don't get
[2368.96 - 2373.64] scared don't get worried this isn't a
[2370.76 - 2374.92] this isn't a scary show this show is a
[2373.64 - 2376.84] powerful show to give you an
[2374.92 - 2378.68] understanding you never had before so
[2376.84 - 2380.28] you can do something about it and really
[2378.68 - 2382.84] protect yourself like really protect
[2380.28 - 2385.52] yourself not just stupid protecting talk
[2382.84 - 2388.68] like really protect yourself good stuff
[2385.52 - 2391.72] really good stuff is you know it's
[2388.68 - 2393.16] important to know all this so the poison
[2391.72 - 2396.96] severely
[2393.16 - 2399.36] mutates and then what happens is the
[2396.96 - 2402.12] viruses start to adapt for that new
[2399.36 - 2404.72] poison so the viruses are eating these
[2402.12 - 2406.40] denatured cells these death these dying
[2404.72 - 2407.92] cells that are in a little tissue a
[2406.40 - 2410.32] little organ tissue they're they're
[2407.92 - 2412.64] eating these cells that have already
[2410.32 - 2415.48] been remanufactured even once or
[2412.64 - 2418.92] twice and they're eating these
[2415.48 - 2420.76] cells and the viruses themselves can't
[2418.92 - 2424.48] even handle the level of toxin they
[2420.76 - 2427.88] created to begin with the virus can't
[2424.48 - 2430.56] even handle the level of toxin that it
[2427.88 - 2432.28] had created it's too much for the virus
[2430.56 - 2435.40] itself the original virus that started
[2432.28 - 2437.56] out it's way too much and you're hearing
[2435.40 - 2440.12] for the first time in history anywhere
[2437.56 - 2441.44] right here how how a virus mutates cuz
[2440.12 - 2443.36] no one else will tell you cuz they don't
[2441.44 - 2445.68] know there's no lab there's no chemical
[2443.36 - 2448.44] La chemistry lab there's no biology
[2445.68 - 2451.08] place there's no you know immune expert
[2448.44 - 2452.52] out there that knows it it doesn't exist
[2451.08 - 2454.24] I'm just letting you know I'm not trying
[2452.52 - 2455.76] to do that to be cocky sounding and
[2454.24 - 2457.04] eggomatic that's not it at all it's
[2455.76 - 2459.16] because if I don't don't give you the
[2457.04 - 2460.96] point and you just probably think this
[2459.16 - 2462.32] stuff's online somewhere and you go out
[2460.96 - 2463.64] looking around and you to find some
[2462.32 - 2465.64] other interesting little tidbit of
[2463.64 - 2467.32] information and you just lose lose you
[2465.64 - 2472.28] know you lose
[2467.32 - 2477.28] this that's why I say what I say
[2472.28 - 2480.12] so the deal is the virus itself gets
[2477.28 - 2483.44] poisoned in order to not let the virus
[2480.12 - 2485.52] die which a few of them end up dying
[2483.44 - 2488.08] from that noxious poison from that toxic
[2485.52 - 2489.64] poison a few few of them do die viruses
[2488.08 - 2492.00] and you say hey that's great that's
[2489.64 - 2494.24] perfect in that situation it's not
[2492.00 - 2496.56] perfect because the virus is quickly
[2494.24 - 2498.52] adapt a virus quickly adapts it has to
[2496.56 - 2501.28] adapt and in order to adapt it has to
[2498.52 - 2504.20] mutate it has to
[2501.28 - 2507.68] mutate that's what the virus has to do
[2504.20 - 2510.88] has to change gears has to change gears
[2507.68 - 2513.76] fast because
[2510.88 - 2516.40] viruses the majority of all viruses
[2513.76 - 2518.44] don't want you really getting hurt in
[2516.40 - 2520.24] the end they want to live forever and
[2518.44 - 2521.72] live free and live happy they don't want
[2520.24 - 2525.28] to hurt you in the end just like the
[2521.72 - 2527.84] retrovirus HIV retrovirus it it's never
[2525.28 - 2529.64] there to kill anybody retroviruses don't
[2527.84 - 2531.28] kill anybody it's other things that kill
[2529.64 - 2533.80] people that's what happened with the
[2531.28 - 2536.16] whole AIDS epidemic all all long all
[2533.80 - 2538.88] along people aren't dying anymore of
[2536.16 - 2541.00] AIDS because of new AIDS drugs people
[2538.88 - 2543.52] aren't dying anymore of AIDS because the
[2541.00 - 2546.52] fear of of God and the fear of dying and
[2543.52 - 2548.52] all that's been been dropped back
[2546.52 - 2550.60] because because and that's a big part of
[2548.52 - 2551.84] why people died so much as they thought
[2550.60 - 2553.88] they had a death sentence that would
[2551.84 - 2555.84] kill them in two days because that's
[2553.88 - 2558.76] that's how it was purported out there
[2555.84 - 2561.80] misinformation it hurt so many
[2558.76 - 2564.88] people but retroviruses and all viruses
[2561.80 - 2567.56] they just not all viruses I'm sorry
[2564.88 - 2570.44] viruses that are more just stealth more
[2567.56 - 2573.72] natural-based um they have a lineage in
[2570.44 - 2576.64] our history so the vir you know a virus
[2573.72 - 2578.88] can get this poison in its system get
[2576.64 - 2581.72] this poisonous system and die but but
[2578.88 - 2583.88] but the viruses quickly learn from
[2581.72 - 2587.00] another virus that died it quickly
[2583.88 - 2589.76] learns and so it actually
[2587.00 - 2593.24] adapts and once it adapts it can handle
[2589.76 - 2595.04] a higher level a level you know six a
[2593.24 - 2598.40] level you know
[2595.04 - 2600.60] higher of poison so as it eating the
[2598.40 - 2602.84] dead cells the human cells our cells as
[2600.60 - 2604.40] it's eating the dead cells out of a out
[2602.84 - 2607.20] of some tissue out of some connective
[2604.40 - 2609.64] tissue out of an organ out of the liver
[2607.20 - 2611.08] out of the lung wherever cancers go and
[2609.64 - 2613.36] wherever cancers start and all these
[2611.08 - 2614.72] different things it's eating all this
[2613.36 - 2616.68] and get that dead cells it's
[2614.72 - 2618.68] remanufacturing once again and it's
[2616.68 - 2620.80] getting stronger and that stronger
[2618.68 - 2623.08] material kills a few more viral cells
[2620.80 - 2625.84] that come along and try to
[2623.08 - 2627.96] engage and then more adapting occurs and
[2625.84 - 2629.28] more mutating of viruses have to amp up
[2627.96 - 2633.04] and the viruses
[2629.28 - 2635.72] become a different type of virus and not
[2633.04 - 2638.64] a virus that can make you feel super
[2635.72 - 2640.76] duper for sick necessarily viruses you
[2638.64 - 2643.00] don't even feel you're not feeling
[2640.76 - 2644.36] anything going on you're barely feeling
[2643.00 - 2647.00] anything there's nothing even going on
[2644.36 - 2648.96] you're just living your life all is
[2647.00 - 2652.48] good
[2648.96 - 2656.08] so so basically that adapting
[2652.48 - 2658.84] occurs and the virus has to become
[2656.08 - 2662.12] something different So eventually the
[2658.84 - 2665.56] virus goes to another stage where it
[2662.12 - 2667.04] mutates so destructively or so
[2665.56 - 2668.92] differently
[2667.04 - 2670.80] because of the level of toxins that were
[2668.92 - 2672.56] constantly remanufactured over and over
[2670.80 - 2676.48] and over
[2672.56 - 2679.08] again it had to change its game to the
[2676.48 - 2682.56] point where that Viral cell became now a
[2679.08 - 2685.24] cancer cell the viral cell is a cancer
[2682.56 - 2686.84] cell that's when it became a cancer cell
[2685.24 - 2689.44] and nowhere in medical history do they
[2686.84 - 2691.52] know this part yet they know that
[2689.44 - 2693.48] viruses could be a cancer cell they know
[2691.52 - 2696.08] that some viruses create cancers they
[2693.48 - 2698.56] finally know that now guess what I knew
[2696.08 - 2700.24] that as a child I got that information
[2698.56 - 2702.16] from my source as a child before it was
[2700.24 - 2707.16] even out
[2702.16 - 2709.64] there but they know that now but they
[2707.16 - 2712.52] don't know the process of how it gets
[2709.64 - 2713.72] there and the reason why they're not
[2712.52 - 2717.80] going
[2713.72 - 2721.20] to is because that virus isn't your
[2717.80 - 2723.36] fault that you have it if you do if if
[2721.20 - 2725.00] like they say 50% of the of the world's
[2723.36 - 2726.44] population is going to have cancer in 20
[2725.00 - 2728.88] years
[2726.44 - 2730.64] versus you know the other 50% not having
[2728.88 - 2732.68] if the rates are going to be that high
[2730.64 - 2735.44] it's not your
[2732.68 - 2738.08] fault that you have that virus and it's
[2735.44 - 2739.44] not your fault you have those chemicals
[2738.08 - 2743.08] those chemical compounds those
[2739.44 - 2746.52] destructive compounds those toxins it's
[2743.08 - 2749.24] not your fault it's somebody else's
[2746.52 - 2750.72] fault believe it or not and it points
[2749.24 - 2753.36] back to the
[2750.72 - 2756.16] industries and if it gets out that none
[2753.36 - 2757.84] of this cancer was your fault at all and
[2756.16 - 2759.36] someone else is fallen and he gets out
[2757.84 - 2760.80] there then there's hell to pay and
[2759.36 - 2762.80] there's trillions and trillions and
[2760.80 - 2766.08] trillions of dollars in Damages look at
[2762.80 - 2770.00] it ASB bestus cancer misilo look at ASB
[2766.08 - 2773.72] bestus cancer okay they got a $30
[2770.00 - 2777.52] billion fund sitting out there for just
[2773.72 - 2778.84] one cancer an industrial cancer asbest
[2777.52 - 2782.36] by the way
[2778.84 - 2784.60] asbest es bestus doesn't need a virus
[2782.36 - 2787.28] that's why I didn't add it to all the
[2784.60 - 2790.36] toxins and all the the the poisons I
[2787.28 - 2794.28] talked about it doesn't need a virus
[2790.36 - 2798.00] aestus on its own can create an aestus
[2794.28 - 2801.20] cancer it's literally its own breed its
[2798.00 - 2803.20] own breed completely separate from 99%
[2801.20 - 2808.60] of all the other cancers which guess
[2803.20 - 2812.56] what are viral cancers 99% of all the
[2808.60 - 2816.20] cancers out there are viral cancers you
[2812.56 - 2818.76] guys except for asbestos cancer but look
[2816.20 - 2820.28] there's a$ 30 30 m billion sorry $ 30
[2818.76 - 2822.72] billion
[2820.28 - 2826.84] fund for people who've been afflicted by
[2822.72 - 2829.08] asbestos cancer right right well because
[2826.84 - 2833.60] it was somebody's
[2829.08 - 2836.04] fault but if we were told that it took a
[2833.60 - 2838.40] virus and it took all these different
[2836.04 - 2840.16] host of chemicals right down since the
[2838.40 - 2841.88] industrial re Revolution the
[2840.16 - 2844.36] corporations and the industries and
[2841.88 - 2846.88] everything else going back since 1799
[2844.36 - 2849.80] since 1817 the birth of the industrial
[2846.88 - 2852.32] re Revolution would have to come up with
[2849.80 - 2854.52] funds of billions and billions of
[2852.32 - 2856.32] dollars it would equal trillions and
[2854.52 - 2858.12] trillions and especially since it's
[2856.32 - 2859.40] going to carry on for decades and
[2858.12 - 2861.28] decades and decades and more people are
[2859.40 - 2862.64] going to get cancer and sick of can sick
[2861.28 - 2864.64] with cancer and die and all these other
[2862.64 - 2867.72] things that suffer with every in the
[2864.64 - 2869.96] future unless they learn information and
[2867.72 - 2872.00] protect themselves really and watch the
[2869.96 - 2873.88] back and because more and more that's
[2872.00 - 2876.84] going to happen it wouldn't just be some
[2873.88 - 2879.32] asbest fund of 30 billion
[2876.84 - 2883.32] it would be in the trillions higher than
[2879.32 - 2885.52] the country's country's debt of 20
[2883.32 - 2887.60] trillion do that we have now which is
[2885.52 - 2888.88] the country's debt it would be higher
[2887.60 - 2892.92] than
[2888.88 - 2895.60] 1920 trillion do can you believe that
[2892.92 - 2898.40] yes it would be higher than that so it
[2895.60 - 2900.80] has to be your fault it has to be your
[2898.40 - 2903.12] fault something that is in your jeans
[2900.80 - 2905.76] cuz you got bad
[2903.12 - 2908.56] jeans jeans play a role in a lot of
[2905.76 - 2910.88] different things don't get me wrong but
[2908.56 - 2912.68] it's not why someone gets cancer that's
[2910.88 - 2915.08] why the Brock 1 Brock two Gene with
[2912.68 - 2916.48] breast cancer that's why the majority of
[2915.08 - 2918.12] women with breast breast cancer don't
[2916.48 - 2920.20] have the Brock one or Brock two Gene but
[2918.12 - 2922.20] what happened is the misinformation has
[2920.20 - 2924.68] to get out there they have to feed it to
[2922.20 - 2926.12] people because if you know the truth
[2924.68 - 2928.00] someone's going to take the blame down
[2926.12 - 2930.32] the road someone's going to find out how
[2928.00 - 2932.36] the first Epstein bars and the first hhv
[2930.32 - 2935.24] 6es and the first different viruses
[2932.36 - 2937.40] started back in the early 1900s and who
[2935.24 - 2939.72] started in where someone's going to find
[2937.40 - 2941.80] out another $5 trillion right there a
[2939.72 - 2943.12] payback someone's going to find out I
[2941.80 - 2945.16] saw the chemical companies which
[2943.12 - 2947.44] chemicals and everything else that's why
[2945.16 - 2949.96] you can't really get a straight anything
[2947.44 - 2953.56] out of anybody so they do it General
[2949.96 - 2955.20] dioxin they Compass it into one package
[2953.56 - 2956.80] so no one gets the blame no one takes
[2955.20 - 2960.16] the blame you say oh dioxins could
[2956.80 - 2962.60] create cancer it kind of do on a rat so
[2960.16 - 2964.52] you know but that's about as far as it
[2962.60 - 2966.52] goes
[2964.52 - 2969.40] so
[2966.52 - 2971.04] let's let's let's keep on going let's
[2969.40 - 2973.32] keep on
[2971.04 - 2975.20] going so here's the annoying part the
[2973.32 - 2978.92] cancer
[2975.20 - 2982.00] virus can do something it can create a c
[2978.92 - 2983.72] meaning now now a cancer cell so the
[2982.00 - 2985.76] virus can create a cancer
[2983.72 - 2989.20] cell all
[2985.76 - 2991.72] right and when it does this here's
[2989.20 - 2994.48] here's what's annoying it releases a
[2991.72 - 2997.88] chemical out of it a chemical that
[2994.48 - 3000.68] saturates the human cell in the adjacent
[2997.88 - 3003.32] area that was poisoned originally with
[3000.68 - 3006.08] remanufactured toxins over and over
[3003.32 - 3009.12] again so it can actually deliver now a
[3006.08 - 3012.96] chemical a biochemical it can the cell
[3009.12 - 3016.68] can produce a chemical and shoot it out
[3012.96 - 3019.84] into adjacent human cells in a tissue in
[3016.68 - 3021.52] an organ in an adjacent area and it can
[3019.84 - 3026.92] do
[3021.52 - 3029.32] this and turn a human cell into a cancer
[3026.92 - 3031.56] cell and that human cell is going to be
[3029.32 - 3033.28] different than the viral cancer cell and
[3031.56 - 3036.52] this is something science of research
[3033.28 - 3038.64] has not discovered there's a subtle and
[3036.52 - 3043.12] critical difference in every
[3038.64 - 3047.08] tumor and every lesion a cancerous
[3043.12 - 3050.84] lesion in in any bone cancer there's a
[3047.08 - 3053.00] subtle difference there's viral cells
[3050.84 - 3056.40] that literally pose identically as the
[3053.00 - 3058.28] human cell cancer so there's a cancer
[3056.40 - 3060.64] viral cell and a human cancer cell that
[3058.28 - 3062.32] pose identically to each other because
[3060.64 - 3064.40] science hasn't been able to divide them
[3062.32 - 3066.64] yet they haven't been able to open up a
[3064.40 - 3068.60] tumor and know which one's which and
[3066.64 - 3072.56] know which one's which haven't gotten
[3068.60 - 3073.80] there yet that's another 20 30 years
[3072.56 - 3079.08] from
[3073.80 - 3083.56] now but that's what happens right there
[3079.08 - 3086.84] so a human cell turns into a cancer
[3083.56 - 3089.72] cell and the cancer cell the the the
[3086.84 - 3091.96] virus turns into a cancer cell first
[3089.72 - 3095.68] obviously and so it creates a human
[3091.96 - 3098.12] cancer cell and they communicate and
[3095.68 - 3100.00] they start to share the foods they like
[3098.12 - 3102.56] they sh they start to share
[3100.00 - 3105.12] communication for what that cancer likes
[3102.56 - 3107.20] to eat yeah what that cancer likes to
[3105.12 - 3110.56] eat which we're going into a whole bunch
[3107.20 - 3114.60] of other stuff so I hope you're enjoying
[3110.56 - 3117.48] this this ride um you know and you're
[3114.60 - 3119.16] not upset or anything else just you know
[3117.48 - 3121.40] just maybe some like I said lemon balm
[3119.16 - 3122.56] tea is one of my favorites because why
[3121.40 - 3126.84] it's one of the most powerful
[3122.56 - 3129.64] anti-cancerous teas that I love so so I
[3126.84 - 3132.08] love the lemon balm but Peppermint's
[3129.64 - 3134.36] good too just to you know relax overall
[3132.08 - 3137.60] as well Chom meal is okay so whatever
[3134.36 - 3139.88] you got in your cupboard let's do it so
[3137.60 - 3141.08] let's go back into this let's go back
[3139.88 - 3146.04] into the different factors and
[3141.08 - 3150.64] everything else so as more cells gather
[3146.04 - 3152.92] in tissue and and they they can actually
[3150.64 - 3155.48] poison more cells so we need that before
[3152.92 - 3158.52] multiplying occurs we need a poisoning
[3155.48 - 3161.04] to occur so the virus is poisoning more
[3158.52 - 3163.68] good cells they're dying it's
[3161.04 - 3165.60] remanufacturing again it's
[3163.68 - 3168.28] remanufacturing stronger and stronger
[3165.60 - 3170.76] like I said before the human cells are
[3168.28 - 3175.32] dying turning into cancer
[3170.76 - 3176.92] cells but multiplying has not occurred
[3175.32 - 3179.40] and this is why people may just have a
[3176.92 - 3181.24] lesion you know a really bad lesion on a
[3179.40 - 3182.80] liver doctors don't know if it's good
[3181.24 - 3184.24] bad cancer or not unless they do a
[3182.80 - 3186.12] biopsy and some many times they're still
[3184.24 - 3188.04] not even sure to be
[3186.12 - 3191.68] honest
[3188.04 - 3192.80] and so as this is occurring so this can
[3191.68 - 3194.16] also create a whole bunch of different
[3192.80 - 3195.96] carcinomas there's not just one
[3194.16 - 3197.64] carcinoma obviously it's a really
[3195.96 - 3200.20] popular cancer and there's different
[3197.64 - 3202.32] varieties of mutated forms of carcinoma
[3200.20 - 3204.00] and it can and remember variations
[3202.32 - 3205.88] matter with all the different poisons
[3204.00 - 3208.84] what poisons were involved was it old
[3205.88 - 3210.64] DDT was it a pesticide was it herbicide
[3208.84 - 3213.48] was it a fungicide from buying new
[3210.64 - 3215.68] clothes at the shopping Mark was it uh
[3213.48 - 3217.64] was it anything was it detergents was it
[3215.68 - 3219.32] was it conventional detergents I won't
[3217.64 - 3220.92] may name the names but all those
[3219.32 - 3224.12] conventional deter detergents you know
[3220.92 - 3226.36] you see commercials for that easily
[3224.12 - 3228.28] could spawn on and feed a virus and and
[3226.36 - 3230.28] create a Cancer all these different
[3228.28 - 3235.20] toxins and chemical warfare that we're
[3230.28 - 3238.16] up against so what occurs after a while
[3235.20 - 3241.64] is a tumor can start because the cells
[3238.16 - 3243.40] the human cells that are cancerous now
[3241.64 - 3245.76] they're staying alive more than they're
[3243.40 - 3248.08] dying so more than they're dying off
[3245.76 - 3249.72] they're staying alive because cancer
[3248.08 - 3251.80] cells at the beginning can naturally die
[3249.72 - 3254.28] off they can naturally die
[3251.80 - 3256.56] off they can't just like a virus because
[3254.28 - 3260.16] the virus FedEd
[3256.56 - 3263.92] information and so but the reproduction
[3260.16 - 3266.28] of the poison is so toxic so dangerous
[3263.92 - 3268.84] that's saturating more and more cells
[3266.28 - 3272.04] and the cells start to accumulate while
[3268.84 - 3275.68] alive and mutated and they group
[3272.04 - 3277.36] together and they start forming a very
[3275.68 - 3279.12] microscopic
[3277.36 - 3282.76] membrane
[3279.12 - 3284.00] extremely microscopic vessels kind of
[3282.76 - 3287.00] like blood
[3284.00 - 3290.24] vessels really small and it starts to
[3287.00 - 3291.64] connect them all together kind of like
[3290.24 - 3293.40] like kind of like when you go to a tree
[3291.64 - 3296.56] and you saw all the different veins on a
[3293.40 - 3297.44] leaf but more so than this kind of like
[3296.56 - 3300.04] a
[3297.44 - 3303.16] beehive kind of like that too and it
[3300.04 - 3306.84] starts to connect with having an ability
[3303.16 - 3309.60] to feed itself what it needs feed itself
[3306.84 - 3312.24] the poison it needs feed itself the food
[3309.60 - 3315.60] it needs to stay
[3312.24 - 3318.40] alive and it so it groups itself but as
[3315.60 - 3320.56] it groups itself it groups itself and
[3318.40 - 3323.16] encapsulates a whole bunch of viruses
[3320.56 - 3326.28] too that are also
[3323.16 - 3328.52] mutated they become one
[3326.28 - 3331.40] but what has to grow out of it is
[3328.52 - 3334.68] angiogenesis well angiogenesis you know
[3331.40 - 3336.84] you know that that's not nothing new
[3334.68 - 3338.60] angiogenesis but I'll tell you something
[3336.84 - 3341.24] new
[3338.60 - 3343.08] angiogenesis okay are these different
[3341.24 - 3345.52] blood vessels that are coming out like
[3343.08 - 3348.44] tentacles so the tumor can grow and mass
[3345.52 - 3352.40] reduce and take it take in more tissue
[3348.44 - 3355.04] or even Tak in more cells through
[3352.40 - 3360.08] angiogenesis viruses tend to try to
[3355.04 - 3361.52] deliver human cells up the veins of the
[3360.08 - 3364.24] blood vessels the
[3361.52 - 3366.48] androgenesis um viruses start to become
[3364.24 - 3369.96] from the outside of the tumor Delivery
[3366.48 - 3371.32] Systems Delivery Systems and adrenaline
[3369.96 - 3372.40] is a big part of this if you're under
[3371.32 - 3373.56] too much stress You're Going Through
[3372.40 - 3376.08] Hell all these different things are
[3373.56 - 3380.12] going on in your life adrenaline can
[3376.08 - 3382.32] help open up the the the the tentacle
[3380.12 - 3384.20] the androgenesis and science has no clue
[3382.32 - 3386.04] about these parts and I want to give you
[3384.20 - 3389.00] the four warning on these different
[3386.04 - 3392.56] pieces and it helps Drive cells up that
[3389.00 - 3396.16] the that the viruses are bringing up
[3392.56 - 3399.76] virus can bring cells up and also
[3396.16 - 3402.24] deliver them up in different ways up
[3399.76 - 3404.76] this these tiny blood
[3402.24 - 3407.00] vessels and the
[3404.76 - 3409.00] adrenaline prompts the blood vessels to
[3407.00 - 3411.12] open up even wider it's why people who
[3409.00 - 3412.64] are under enormous stress and don't take
[3411.12 - 3414.08] care of themselves and have any
[3412.64 - 3415.40] anti-cancerous foods and all these
[3414.08 - 3417.84] different things can
[3415.40 - 3421.12] can come down with a
[3417.84 - 3422.84] cancer so as this is happening these
[3421.12 - 3424.76] tentacles and blood vessels are are
[3422.84 - 3426.00] reaching out the tumor can grow the
[3424.76 - 3430.12] cancer can
[3426.00 - 3432.92] grow but it's going to need more fuel
[3430.12 - 3435.20] and more food and that's where that's
[3432.92 - 3437.64] where the important stuff really comes
[3435.20 - 3440.76] in to try to stop cancers try to reverse
[3437.64 - 3443.56] cancers try to prevent Cancers and it's
[3440.76 - 3445.56] foods and how foods
[3443.56 - 3446.76] work and
[3445.56 - 3448.44] that's where we're going to go into
[3446.76 - 3449.72] we're going to do a little food time is
[3448.44 - 3451.28] everybody ready for that we'll do a
[3449.72 - 3454.32] little food
[3451.28 - 3455.96] time and actually actually before the
[3454.32 - 3457.56] food time let's go into a little bit of
[3455.96 - 3462.84] Epstein bar let's go into a little bit
[3457.56 - 3465.08] of viral time let's do that now in order
[3462.84 - 3467.48] to keep a virus happy technically you
[3465.08 - 3469.56] really have to be feeding foods that
[3467.48 - 3470.88] viruses love that's another factor of it
[3469.56 - 3472.20] so not only do you have chemicals and
[3470.88 - 3473.56] poisons and toxins and all these
[3472.20 - 3475.04] different things that are in your system
[3473.56 - 3476.40] that you can get from all all these
[3475.04 - 3480.08] different solvents and every all the
[3476.40 - 3482.68] exposure I talked about but you can also
[3480.08 - 3484.76] be eating all the wrong foods and
[3482.68 - 3486.32] viruses love the wrong Foods now if you
[3484.76 - 3488.28] feed the vir if you don't Fe feed the
[3486.32 - 3489.88] viruses the wrong Foods anymore and you
[3488.28 - 3491.44] just have the toxins you might not get
[3489.88 - 3493.88] cancer you might even be able to stop it
[3491.44 - 3496.88] it's the food component that falls into
[3493.88 - 3500.36] the whole thing too the real bad foods
[3496.88 - 3503.84] that actually falls into it but Epstein
[3500.36 - 3505.68] bar which doesn't really which is really
[3503.84 - 3507.40] somewhat of a doile virus and it's not
[3505.68 - 3509.44] really supposed to create cancer as
[3507.40 - 3511.56] anything it gets fed all the things it
[3509.44 - 3513.24] wants and you know it there's different
[3511.56 - 3514.88] strains of Epstein bar I talk about it
[3513.24 - 3516.28] in you know all the time you guys you
[3514.88 - 3518.96] know you know you've heard all my
[3516.28 - 3520.16] different shows I won't go deep into it
[3518.96 - 3522.80] but he talk about the 60 different
[3520.16 - 3524.68] varieties that I've found um over the
[3522.80 - 3527.60] years nobody knows about different
[3524.68 - 3530.60] mutated varieties I mean I remember just
[3527.60 - 3533.48] seven years ago uh talking to a chemist
[3530.60 - 3535.28] and and and a biologist and an
[3533.48 - 3536.72] immunologist talk talking to all three
[3535.28 - 3539.72] of them because it was about a patient
[3536.72 - 3543.12] and I was explaining about um about
[3539.72 - 3545.44] their patient and my client and I was
[3543.12 - 3547.20] talking about you know the the different
[3545.44 - 3548.52] variety of the mutations of Epstein B
[3547.20 - 3551.28] and they and they they couldn't even
[3548.52 - 3552.76] believe it now you know some guys just
[3551.28 - 3554.84] like yeah you know what I believe that
[3552.76 - 3556.60] viruses probably do mutate and it's it's
[3554.84 - 3558.68] it's actually for some reason people can
[3556.60 - 3560.92] digest it better now it's amazing how
[3558.68 - 3563.16] time has to go by it's sad it's really
[3560.92 - 3567.04] sad though that it has to go by like
[3563.16 - 3569.36] that so what happens is you got the you
[3567.04 - 3571.80] got the uh you got the virus cells virus
[3569.36 - 3576.92] cells viral cancer cells tend to also
[3571.80 - 3579.28] teach the human cancer cells what to eat
[3576.92 - 3580.68] like I was talking about what to like
[3579.28 - 3583.32] and that's why a tumor can grow bigger
[3580.68 - 3585.96] and bigger if it has a lot of mutated
[3583.32 - 3588.52] human cells in that tumor it'll start
[3585.96 - 3590.40] getting an appetite of what that virus
[3588.52 - 3593.64] likes like for instance an Epstein bar
[3590.40 - 3596.12] loves dairy products and loves
[3593.64 - 3597.32] eggs and it loves all these different
[3596.12 - 3599.44] foods we're going to cover in a little
[3597.32 - 3601.96] bit but let's talk about Epstein bar
[3599.44 - 3605.12] cancers carcinoma it's all Epstein bar
[3601.96 - 3607.20] cancer every carcinoma is Epstein bar
[3605.12 - 3609.76] it's a variety of Epstein bar that's
[3607.20 - 3612.88] been mutated and can create
[3609.76 - 3614.08] cancer and that's all the carcinomas now
[3612.88 - 3615.40] if you have epine bar you don't have to
[3614.08 - 3618.24] worry it's not about you're going to get
[3615.40 - 3619.64] cancer or not no so you can do things so
[3618.24 - 3621.28] that you don't get cancer you can do
[3619.64 - 3622.44] things so you can stop cancers you can
[3621.28 - 3625.32] do things and that's what this
[3622.44 - 3627.24] information is about Epstein B
[3625.32 - 3629.52] is literally responsible for all the
[3627.24 - 3630.72] carcinomas it's responsible for every
[3629.52 - 3634.76] prostate
[3630.72 - 3636.52] cancer it's responsible for every
[3634.76 - 3639.04] leukemia some
[3636.52 - 3641.40] leukemias have heavy metals behind them
[3639.04 - 3644.12] but you need the virus remember what I
[3641.40 - 3646.76] talked about before you have to have a
[3644.12 - 3648.88] toxin and you have to have a
[3646.76 - 3652.48] virus all the
[3648.88 - 3656.56] leukemias are Epstein bar children's
[3652.48 - 3658.60] leukemia Epstein bar with heavy metal
[3656.56 - 3661.52] preferably
[3658.60 - 3664.64] Mercury and um it's all the prostate
[3661.52 - 3666.40] cancers all the breast cancers I repeat
[3664.64 - 3668.12] all the breast cancers Epstein bar I've
[3666.40 - 3669.60] been saying that forever and now it's
[3668.12 - 3672.32] information that's finally starting to
[3669.60 - 3674.60] take that information just starting to
[3672.32 - 3676.68] surface but I promise you I've been
[3674.60 - 3679.52] saying that forever I'll go all the way
[3676.68 - 3682.56] back in time on that one um I was the
[3679.52 - 3685.44] first one to say that the first one I
[3682.56 - 3687.36] believe um and I say that
[3685.44 - 3689.00] because it's important to know the
[3687.36 - 3690.76] information and and the differences and
[3689.00 - 3695.20] everything else breast cancer Epstein
[3690.76 - 3698.12] bar 100% lung cancers most lung cancers
[3695.20 - 3699.36] are Epstein barus lung cancer no it's
[3698.12 - 3702.08] not Epstein
[3699.36 - 3704.72] bar that's what I talked about before
[3702.08 - 3708.16] thyroid cancer is Epstein
[3704.72 - 3712.92] bar all liver
[3708.16 - 3715.92] cancers Epstein bar some brain
[3712.92 - 3718.84] cancers Epstein
[3715.92 - 3721.44] bar very important to understand so
[3718.84 - 3725.96] that's just the tip of the iceberg right
[3721.44 - 3727.68] there tip of the iceberg right now um
[3725.96 - 3729.84] it's starting the word for HPV is
[3727.68 - 3733.12] starting to get out where HPV
[3729.84 - 3734.52] creates creates um cervical cancer
[3733.12 - 3737.40] creates it creates different cancers
[3734.52 - 3740.72] ovarian cancer creates um and you know
[3737.40 - 3742.56] and that's that's out there now and it's
[3740.72 - 3745.04] HPV
[3742.56 - 3747.24] but HPV is always
[3745.04 - 3749.36] present but it's Epstein bar that
[3747.24 - 3751.36] creates ovarian cancers all the ovarian
[3749.36 - 3754.28] cancers all the cervical cancers all the
[3751.36 - 3756.52] uter uterine cancers that's epine bar
[3754.28 - 3758.84] that creates us cancers it's just that
[3756.52 - 3760.92] the more epine bar you have in the
[3758.84 - 3762.00] reproductive system which a lot of women
[3760.92 - 3765.36] have a lot of epine bar in the
[3762.00 - 3766.84] productive system um the more HPV
[3765.36 - 3768.68] because the immune system is lowered in
[3766.84 - 3770.36] the reproductive system the reproductive
[3768.68 - 3771.52] systems immune system is dropped down so
[3770.36 - 3774.64] you can have higher
[3771.52 - 3775.84] HPV if you're killing off HPV by eating
[3774.64 - 3777.36] healthy and doing all these wonderful
[3775.84 - 3778.68] things and everything and you notice HPV
[3777.36 - 3780.16] is going down or a doctor says hey you
[3778.68 - 3781.36] don't have HPV anymore chances are you
[3780.16 - 3783.72] knocked down your Epstein bar at the
[3781.36 - 3786.48] same time and had no
[3783.72 - 3789.00] clue and that's how it works
[3786.48 - 3791.04] there um I'm not saying HPV is this
[3789.00 - 3794.28] great friendly virus that causes no harm
[3791.04 - 3797.28] at all it can cause Scar
[3794.28 - 3798.56] Tissue but that's not the scar tissue
[3797.28 - 3800.64] that's behind the Epstein bar
[3798.56 - 3802.68] reproductive cancers it's this important
[3800.64 - 3805.96] bit of information I'd like to get
[3802.68 - 3809.20] across um
[3805.96 - 3811.36] so let's let's let's keep on going we
[3809.20 - 3813.92] got we got some stuff to talk about the
[3811.36 - 3816.84] different viruses let's talk about hhv6
[3813.92 - 3820.24] real really quick hhv6 creates kidney
[3816.84 - 3826.04] cancers that's a human herpes virus
[3820.24 - 3829.32] hhv6 all the h7s the eights oh look um
[3826.04 - 3831.84] saroma okay that's a herpes virus but
[3829.32 - 3833.76] but science research knows that one too
[3831.84 - 3837.60] that that's a herpes virus but there's
[3833.76 - 3840.12] also hh9 10 undiscovered 10 undiscovered
[3837.60 - 3841.72] hhv1 undiscovered hv12 I talk about my
[3840.12 - 3843.96] herpy show those are all cancer
[3841.72 - 3846.88] promoters cancer creators all the
[3843.96 - 3849.12] different mutations of
[3846.88 - 3851.16] hhv6 actually create a lot of different
[3849.12 - 3854.76] cancers heart cancers cancers of the
[3851.16 - 3858.16] heart cancers of the stomach Epstein bar
[3854.76 - 3861.20] can create cancers of the pancreas
[3858.16 - 3862.52] hhv6 K kidney cancer that's one of its
[3861.20 - 3864.96] biggest heart
[3862.52 - 3867.28] cancer um different types of connective
[3864.96 - 3870.72] tissue cancer for hhv6 different brain
[3867.28 - 3874.80] cancers for hhv6 and its mutated
[3870.72 - 3878.40] forms so it's really the herpes viral
[3874.80 - 3880.60] Family as that unit of all of them from
[3878.40 - 3882.20] cyto magal virus which is kind of doile
[3880.60 - 3886.28] but could create a
[3882.20 - 3889.40] Cancer and these these the herpes family
[3886.28 - 3891.76] is mostly responsible not entirely most
[3889.40 - 3893.76] responsible being that other piece that
[3891.76 - 3896.00] you need to create cancer along with all
[3893.76 - 3900.44] those tox we talked about
[3896.00 - 3903.24] before now in order for a tumor to grow
[3900.44 - 3905.00] it needs to draw food it likes so if
[3903.24 - 3907.20] you're still living in a toxic situation
[3905.00 - 3909.28] you're getting doused with lots of
[3907.20 - 3912.36] dioxins of different varieties different
[3909.28 - 3914.44] kinds Fernand in the air you know
[3912.36 - 3915.76] chemical sprays maybe you live someplace
[3914.44 - 3917.12] and they spray all the time try to get
[3915.76 - 3920.08] the schedule so you don't get sprayed
[3917.12 - 3921.88] and hit all the different names if you
[3920.08 - 3924.36] want a weed killer you go you get a bug
[3921.88 - 3925.44] spray a wasp killer and you go and get
[3924.36 - 3927.96] your can of wasp peel and you're
[3925.44 - 3930.48] spraying it if this keeps on adding up
[3927.96 - 3933.12] along with makeups that aren't
[3930.48 - 3936.16] natural as long as creams that aren't
[3933.12 - 3938.28] natural in certain ways um hair care
[3936.16 - 3939.64] products hair dyes all the different
[3938.28 - 3941.52] chemicals and solvents and different
[3939.64 - 3944.52] varities perfumes perfumes are one of
[3941.52 - 3947.28] the worst perfume
[3944.52 - 3949.72] companies would literally have to Fork
[3947.28 - 3952.56] over billions and billions of
[3949.72 - 3954.24] dollars if the truth really got out to
[3952.56 - 3955.60] how to separate these chemical compounds
[3954.24 - 3957.28] where they originate from where they get
[3955.60 - 3960.00] them from and how it
[3957.28 - 3961.76] works like I said before like I said
[3960.00 - 3964.60] before it wouldn't be an asbest fund of
[3961.76 - 3967.68] you know of 30 billion if you add it all
[3964.60 - 3970.72] up it would be way above the country's
[3967.68 - 3975.12] um you know the country's debt of 20
[3970.72 - 3976.84] trillion so what do these cancers really
[3975.12 - 3979.40] like to eat besides all those poisons I
[3976.84 - 3981.16] just mentioned there they need the if a
[3979.40 - 3983.72] cancer becomes a tumor and it's a mix of
[3981.16 - 3985.84] human cells and viral cells it's going
[3983.72 - 3987.80] to need the food you're eating it's
[3985.84 - 3992.08] going to need the food you're eating
[3987.80 - 3993.60] eggs are number one number one on that
[3992.08 - 3996.52] list
[3993.60 - 3998.24] eggs now I look I would love an egg just
[3996.52 - 4000.08] as much as anybody else I talk about
[3998.24 - 4001.24] that so many times people are happy when
[4000.08 - 4003.52] you make them
[4001.24 - 4005.04] eggs and I get it if it's you got
[4003.52 - 4006.96] nothing else to eat and that's all you
[4005.04 - 4009.48] got to eat then we you know work on some
[4006.96 - 4010.48] supplements and I get it you know if
[4009.48 - 4012.92] you're trying to take care of yourself
[4010.48 - 4014.20] and eggs is all you got I get it I'd
[4012.92 - 4017.24] rather have you do something else like
[4014.20 - 4019.96] brown rice over eggs if we could maybe
[4017.24 - 4021.96] get brown rice and I realized that brown
[4019.96 - 4024.08] rice is a grain and some of you are like
[4021.96 - 4026.32] oh he's not ahead of the curve oh here
[4024.08 - 4027.84] we go again he just blew his whole thing
[4026.32 - 4032.32] his whole show because he's talking
[4027.84 - 4035.00] about grains and uh but but brown rice
[4032.32 - 4036.36] doesn't feed a cancer it won't feed a
[4035.00 - 4038.04] cancer I'm just letting you know
[4036.36 - 4040.08] whatever your belief system is on a
[4038.04 - 4041.80] grain that's not the one that feeds
[4040.08 - 4045.52] cancer but I will tell you I will tell
[4041.80 - 4047.20] you this that corn does feed cancer and
[4045.52 - 4049.96] that information is correct out there
[4047.20 - 4052.64] been saying that forever GMO corn will
[4049.96 - 4054.52] feed cancer without a doubt GMO canola
[4052.64 - 4055.88] oil I wouldn't even I I I would probably
[4054.52 - 4058.08] even steer clar if you're worried about
[4055.88 - 4061.56] cancers or something steer clear from
[4058.08 - 4063.12] them but eggs that's the top of the Heap
[4061.56 - 4065.40] right there and that's recommended all
[4063.12 - 4067.16] the time to everyone what every kind of
[4065.40 - 4069.56] illness right now these days eggs it's
[4067.16 - 4072.40] good for you it's got the Omega-3s all
[4069.56 - 4075.04] that but no egg material and eggs
[4072.40 - 4077.20] hormones and natural organic eggs
[4075.04 - 4080.28] hormone-free eggs still have hormones
[4077.20 - 4081.72] eggs are a ball of natural hormones from
[4080.28 - 4083.88] the chicken I'm not talking about
[4081.72 - 4087.96] injected hormones talking about organic
[4083.88 - 4090.72] natural hormones and those feed cancers
[4087.96 - 4093.00] like nothing else does and they drive
[4090.72 - 4095.44] right up the tentacles right up the
[4093.00 - 4097.60] endogenesis right into or right into
[4095.44 - 4099.68] precancer cells which are virus cells
[4097.60 - 4102.72] turning into some kind of cancer right
[4099.68 - 4105.04] in and it drive they just consume it
[4102.72 - 4106.64] they love eggs viruses eggs a whole bit
[4105.04 - 4108.36] it's why you could beat your Epstein bar
[4106.64 - 4110.00] anytime you can kill your Epstein bar
[4108.36 - 4112.04] anytime you just get the V get the
[4110.00 - 4113.48] viruses under control knock them down
[4112.04 - 4117.52] bit right beat him down and talk about
[4113.48 - 4120.84] it on the show on the um the upstein bar
[4117.52 - 4122.96] show so so you got to look out for that
[4120.84 - 4127.08] dairy products are another thing that's
[4122.96 - 4130.88] number two dairy products milk forget it
[4127.08 - 4133.52] goats milk forget it cheese forget it
[4130.88 - 4135.28] okay kefir forget it yogurt forget it
[4133.52 - 4136.76] any anything else I forget cream and
[4135.28 - 4139.60] your coffee forget
[4136.76 - 4141.56] it and coffee is not even great you got
[4139.60 - 4143.28] it dealing with a cancer coffee UPS up
[4141.56 - 4145.16] the adrenaline gets the adrenaline
[4143.28 - 4146.60] pumping and then if you got cream in
[4145.16 - 4148.64] your coffee you could be feeding some
[4146.60 - 4150.68] cells so it's just not even
[4148.64 - 4151.92] good I mean if you're really not worried
[4150.68 - 4153.68] you don't have anything going yeah you
[4151.92 - 4156.52] can enjoy a cup of coffee I guess why
[4153.68 - 4158.68] not but the bottom line is it's the
[4156.52 - 4160.40] foods that I'm talking about get driven
[4158.68 - 4163.32] up
[4160.40 - 4164.60] into the tentacles and get into it and
[4163.32 - 4168.72] here's another thing that you got to
[4164.60 - 4170.96] know about protein protein feeds cancer
[4168.72 - 4172.24] now you're probably getting ready
[4170.96 - 4174.32] getting the stones out and we going to
[4172.24 - 4175.88] throw stones now break glass break
[4174.32 - 4177.80] Windows if you need to break windows
[4175.88 - 4180.00] then don't don't do that no if you need
[4177.80 - 4182.68] to kick kick something kick something
[4180.00 - 4187.76] kick a can kick a can down the
[4182.68 - 4190.76] street but protein feeds cancers cancers
[4187.76 - 4194.24] learn how to eat protein because here's
[4190.76 - 4196.72] why protein doesn't digest so e easily
[4194.24 - 4199.48] in us heavy amounts of protein it
[4196.72 - 4202.80] doesn't digest easy so it doesn't break
[4199.48 - 4205.08] down and it gets it gets into the liver
[4202.80 - 4208.40] it starts to collect in areas of the
[4205.08 - 4211.92] body and it grows toxic and it creates a
[4208.40 - 4215.04] toxin so protein undigested denatured
[4211.92 - 4217.44] protein because becomes denatured for a
[4215.04 - 4220.80] multitude of reasons and it releases a
[4217.44 - 4223.08] chemical chemical that that cancers love
[4220.80 - 4224.32] to feed on so if you're into whoo all
[4223.08 - 4228.00] protein nothing nothing but protein
[4224.32 - 4230.20] nothing but protein you're in the wrong
[4228.00 - 4232.48] game you can have some protein and
[4230.20 - 4234.48] there's great protein sources quinoa is
[4232.48 - 4237.72] a great protein Source it won't feed a
[4234.48 - 4241.20] cancer a black bean is a great protein
[4237.72 - 4243.72] Source won't feed a cancer a spinach
[4241.20 - 4245.56] spinach leaf great protein Source a few
[4243.72 - 4247.80] different kinds of seeds hemp seeds
[4245.56 - 4249.40] incredible protein Source you know I you
[4247.80 - 4251.72] don't need probably a lesson or a
[4249.40 - 4255.52] teaching on that there amazing protein
[4251.72 - 4258.52] sources potato Believe It or Not doesn't
[4255.52 - 4259.52] feed cancer it won't feed cancer but
[4258.52 - 4261.80] you're probably thinking well there's
[4259.52 - 4264.52] sugar in potato sugar feeds cancer no
[4261.80 - 4269.08] here's the deal the wrong sugar feeds
[4264.52 - 4270.36] cancer and in labs they have proven that
[4269.08 - 4272.92] corn
[4270.36 - 4277.08] syrup genetically modified corn syrup
[4272.92 - 4280.36] can feed cancer can actually accelerate
[4277.08 - 4283.16] cancer but they have yet proven because
[4280.36 - 4287.40] they can't and they never will never
[4283.16 - 4290.36] will that fruit and fruit sugar feeds
[4287.40 - 4293.88] cancer the reason why is because they'll
[4290.36 - 4297.04] never have the sugar and fruit
[4293.88 - 4299.20] accompanied with all of that color the
[4297.04 - 4301.48] antioxidants all the phytochemicals that
[4299.20 - 4303.80] stop and kill cancer they'll never have
[4301.48 - 4305.24] the study with that instead they'll
[4303.80 - 4307.72] separate
[4305.24 - 4310.52] fructose and still even fructose by
[4307.72 - 4312.36] itself won't feed a cancer I don't care
[4310.52 - 4314.44] what botch research and I'm going to go
[4312.36 - 4316.28] back to the very beginning remember this
[4314.44 - 4319.76] here's how studies work so you know how
[4316.28 - 4322.04] studies work when someone funds A study
[4319.76 - 4324.36] in medical science both conventional or
[4322.04 - 4325.80] alternative they don't want to know
[4324.36 - 4328.44] their money was
[4325.80 - 4330.96] wasted so when somebody has a big idea
[4328.44 - 4332.48] like a belief system so say St there's
[4330.96 - 4333.76] there's a big doctor that has a belief
[4332.48 - 4335.20] system and they want to prove it and
[4333.76 - 4337.20] they get funding they finally get
[4335.20 - 4338.44] funding it's a big break for them and
[4337.20 - 4340.88] they don't want to be
[4338.44 - 4344.20] humiliated and they get this huge you
[4340.88 - 4347.68] know huge hunk of money to try to
[4344.20 - 4349.08] determine if their Theory applies the
[4347.68 - 4352.72] people who fund
[4349.08 - 4354.28] it don't want to lose that money that
[4352.72 - 4355.68] person will never be funded again if
[4354.28 - 4357.28] they can't prove what they were trying
[4355.68 - 4359.48] to prove this is how this has been a
[4357.28 - 4361.36] history this is going back in history
[4359.48 - 4363.24] over and over again I'm just telling you
[4361.36 - 4366.92] right now this is the beginning of
[4363.24 - 4369.60] medicine so what happens is all right
[4366.92 - 4373.72] that the theory will come out one way or
[4369.60 - 4375.16] another as being proven but fruit sugar
[4373.72 - 4378.28] in a piece of
[4375.16 - 4379.40] fruit with all of its biochem all of its
[4378.28 - 4382.36] amazing
[4379.40 - 4385.32] phytochemicals to actually stop
[4382.36 - 4388.00] cancer that will not feed cancer what
[4385.32 - 4392.64] happens is so when you eat plain old
[4388.00 - 4394.60] corn syrup and plain old cane syrup and
[4392.64 - 4396.36] you're eating cane syrup and corn syrup
[4394.60 - 4397.84] and you're doing a lot of that and it
[4396.36 - 4399.52] happens to be in chocolate cake and
[4397.84 - 4401.60] other things there's a combination of a
[4399.52 - 4404.64] lot of things that feed a cancer that
[4401.60 - 4408.60] can make that corn syrup make that table
[4404.64 - 4410.68] sugar feed cancer It's a combination of
[4408.60 - 4412.84] all of the wheat which is a different
[4410.68 - 4414.88] grain wheat is a different grain than
[4412.84 - 4416.88] the other grains genetically altered
[4414.88 - 4419.72] wheat combination of that all the canola
[4416.88 - 4422.32] oils maybe the lard maybe the fats
[4419.72 - 4425.68] because fats also feed
[4422.32 - 4429.64] cancers higher fat diet you're on the
[4425.68 - 4432.72] faster a cancer can Thrive because fats
[4429.64 - 4435.04] take out the oxygen out of the blood it
[4432.72 - 4438.96] reduces the the oxygen out of the blood
[4435.04 - 4442.80] oxygen kills cancer kills cancer
[4438.96 - 4445.92] cells so when your your oxygen is lower
[4442.80 - 4447.56] than it should be and those tentacles
[4445.92 - 4448.92] are drawing up nutrients and they're
[4447.56 - 4451.04] drawing up nutrients and they're drawing
[4448.92 - 4455.00] up less oxygen than ever before because
[4451.04 - 4456.88] you're on a high protein high fat diet
[4455.00 - 4459.84] you got a better chance of not slowing
[4456.88 - 4462.64] down a cancer so if your diet is you
[4459.84 - 4464.56] know eggs in the morning and you know
[4462.64 - 4466.04] and protein in the afternoon and nothing
[4464.56 - 4468.40] but protein again in the afternoon
[4466.04 - 4470.68] protein in the evening and there's not a
[4468.40 - 4472.80] lot of room for what does stop cancer or
[4470.68 - 4475.00] kills cancer which is fresh fruits and
[4472.80 - 4477.32] vegetables and leafy greens and there's
[4475.00 - 4480.28] not enough of that in there it's not
[4477.32 - 4484.68] going to be enough to stop a cancer so
[4480.28 - 4486.92] easily that's not going to be enough so
[4484.68 - 4489.44] that oxygen diminishes the more higher
[4486.92 - 4492.08] fat you have in the bloodstream it shuts
[4489.44 - 4494.72] down the oxygen levels drops it down
[4492.08 - 4497.36] systematically it drops it down uh
[4494.72 - 4500.40] dramatically and so what happens is when
[4497.36 - 4503.56] that occurs your cancers aren't getting
[4500.40 - 4505.16] oxygen and Cancers Don't Like Oxygen so
[4503.56 - 4507.68] they like the fact that there's lower
[4505.16 - 4510.28] oxygen that's why exercise and you know
[4507.68 - 4511.52] and and fresh food does matter fresh
[4510.28 - 4513.80] fruits and
[4511.52 - 4515.72] vegetables because of the oxygen levels
[4513.80 - 4517.48] that occur in the body and when you thin
[4515.72 - 4518.92] out the blood a little bit Naturally by
[4517.48 - 4520.84] lowering the amount of fats you have
[4518.92 - 4523.56] like you don't have sausage and eggs for
[4520.84 - 4525.40] breakfast or you don't have a big of
[4523.56 - 4527.52] butter on top of some wheat pancakes
[4525.40 - 4529.68] with some lard in the pancake if you
[4527.52 - 4531.68] don't have that then your blood will be
[4529.68 - 4533.32] thinner more oxygen will get in areas
[4531.68 - 4535.44] that cancers could be developing to shut
[4533.32 - 4539.64] it down and stop it so it's really
[4535.44 - 4542.36] important too so right now in the world
[4539.64 - 4543.80] of cancer Sugar's the enemy Sugar's the
[4542.36 - 4546.04] enemy as far as the information that's
[4543.80 - 4550.52] out there right now but I want you to
[4546.04 - 4553.32] know that that that line is blurred corn
[4550.52 - 4556.44] syrup yeah that that's not a good thing
[4553.32 - 4559.60] Thing by no means for cancer too much
[4556.44 - 4561.64] table sugar that's bad for cancer but
[4559.60 - 4563.40] what's really happening is fruit's being
[4561.64 - 4565.72] thrown in there and fruit shouldn't be
[4563.40 - 4569.16] thrown in there because as I talk about
[4565.72 - 4571.04] many times fruit fear is is a dangerous
[4569.16 - 4572.84] thing when you're dealing with Cancers
[4571.04 - 4575.36] or worried or cancer in the family or
[4572.84 - 4576.80] something going on you you got to be
[4575.36 - 4578.36] getting those blueberries those wild
[4576.80 - 4580.32] blueberries you got to be getting those
[4578.36 - 4582.24] strawberries those cranberries
[4580.32 - 4583.64] especially those wild blueberries not
[4582.24 - 4587.24] the regular if you need get regular
[4583.64 - 4589.76] blueberries fine blackberries black
[4587.24 - 4591.52] raspberries yeah sure you know there are
[4589.76 - 4594.00] a lot of information out there now it's
[4591.52 - 4596.84] that they're helpful and people are
[4594.00 - 4599.20] using that in their you know protocols
[4596.84 - 4602.72] for cancer but it's more than that it's
[4599.20 - 4604.44] melons it's apples it's bananas it's
[4602.72 - 4608.48] bananas really
[4604.44 - 4611.40] helpful okay it's papaya it's
[4608.48 - 4614.56] mango it's lots and lots of
[4611.40 - 4617.08] tomatoes lots and lots of Tomatoes all
[4614.56 - 4619.32] these are in incredibly health healthy
[4617.08 - 4623.12] for fighting and battling preventing
[4619.32 - 4624.60] cancer kiwis another one grapes and you
[4623.12 - 4627.52] might think well grapes are loaded with
[4624.60 - 4630.20] sugar actually the sugar and grapes is
[4627.52 - 4633.12] combined you can't separate the sugar
[4630.20 - 4636.44] when it's eaten from the phytochemical
[4633.12 - 4639.92] the antioxidants that kill cancer cells
[4636.44 - 4643.48] so what happens is when you eat a
[4639.92 - 4646.28] grape the sugar is going to go up the
[4643.48 - 4648.20] tent up the tentacle up the endogenesis
[4646.28 - 4650.72] travel the blood vessel and it's going
[4648.20 - 4654.20] to go into the tumor
[4650.72 - 4657.00] with something that the tumor cannot
[4654.20 - 4659.88] tolerate which is what's in the skin of
[4657.00 - 4661.56] the grapes it's what's in that skin of
[4659.88 - 4664.72] the grapes or in a
[4661.56 - 4666.24] raisin and that's dimethyl Resveratrol
[4664.72 - 4668.04] different subgroups of dimethyl
[4666.24 - 4670.92] Resveratrol that aren't even calculated
[4668.04 - 4672.24] or on any any you know the labs don't
[4670.92 - 4673.48] haven't even figured it out that there's
[4672.24 - 4676.52] all kinds of different stuff subgroups
[4673.48 - 4681.48] from dimethyl Resveratrol all on its
[4676.52 - 4683.36] own and goes up into the tumor and it
[4681.48 - 4686.76] starts to kill the tumor starts to
[4683.36 - 4689.44] trigger off an anti-tumor shrinking an
[4686.76 - 4693.12] anti-tumor shrinking
[4689.44 - 4696.44] chemical that is inherently in your
[4693.12 - 4699.36] human cells so even though your human
[4696.44 - 4701.96] cells might have been mutated to such a
[4699.36 - 4703.68] point combined with the viral cell
[4701.96 - 4705.68] mutating becoming cancerous and them
[4703.68 - 4708.08] both joining and being inside of a
[4705.68 - 4710.52] living tumor that's growing even with
[4708.08 - 4714.88] that there's still something you can't
[4710.52 - 4716.84] break that's in that human cell inside
[4714.88 - 4718.48] of a cancerous tumor there's something
[4716.84 - 4722.48] you cannot
[4718.48 - 4725.96] break and it's information there's
[4722.48 - 4728.64] information there's a chemical compound
[4725.96 - 4731.76] that stays in that human
[4728.64 - 4733.80] cell that can be triggered to start
[4731.76 - 4736.32] shrinking a tumor
[4733.80 - 4739.20] and it takes and it
[4736.32 - 4741.12] takes exactly those kinds of foods to
[4739.20 - 4742.64] help someone fight the fight along with
[4741.12 - 4744.48] whatever else they're doing or choosing
[4742.64 - 4746.28] to do in life whatever really good
[4744.48 - 4747.88] Cancer Clinic they found or alternative
[4746.28 - 4751.68] Cancer Clinic they found and everything
[4747.88 - 4754.72] else but the foods matter they matter so
[4751.68 - 4757.12] greatly and the same thing with the wild
[4754.72 - 4759.72] blueberry it has these chemical
[4757.12 - 4761.84] compounds these dimethyl these subgroups
[4759.72 - 4764.16] off the dimethyl R veritol these
[4761.84 - 4766.52] subgroups that trigger off that chemical
[4764.16 - 4768.04] compound in a human cell that's been
[4766.52 - 4769.40] already denatured and mutated to the
[4768.04 - 4771.36] point where it's a cancer cell growing
[4769.40 - 4772.96] into a tumor and multiplying and growing
[4771.36 - 4775.40] and growing and
[4772.96 - 4777.64] growing so fruits and vegetables are
[4775.40 - 4779.16] critical if you can't handle any fruit
[4777.64 - 4780.76] for some reason you're worried about it
[4779.16 - 4782.68] then you just bring in more vegetables
[4780.76 - 4784.76] then and more greens and maybe some red
[4782.68 - 4787.48] bell peppers and orange bell peppers
[4784.76 - 4789.12] bring in some more different foods if
[4787.48 - 4790.00] you can bring in the turmeric that's
[4789.12 - 4794.00] really
[4790.00 - 4796.16] important all these are important
[4794.00 - 4798.40] celer is important celery juice is
[4796.16 - 4799.40] important very helpful I talk about it
[4798.40 - 4801.80] all the
[4799.40 - 4804.64] time heavy metals get out the heavy
[4801.80 - 4807.96] metal detox that we talk about which is
[4804.64 - 4810.76] the sparine as sparine is a great great
[4807.96 - 4814.64] weapon as well barley grass juice powder
[4810.76 - 4816.00] a great weapon and you know and look any
[4814.64 - 4817.40] kind of anything I'm talking about in
[4816.00 - 4819.48] the supplements next with I'm going to
[4817.40 - 4820.88] talk about you can always go to my my
[4819.48 - 4822.40] page I don't sell the supplements but
[4820.88 - 4824.44] you can go to my page on my website and
[4822.40 - 4827.84] know what the ones I like the ones that
[4824.44 - 4830.32] I favor because I know how they help
[4827.84 - 4831.80] people and so it's a directory to get
[4830.32 - 4834.92] you the right so you know what you're
[4831.80 - 4836.84] getting weak grass juice weak grass is
[4834.92 - 4838.36] incredible there's there's um you know
[4836.84 - 4840.52] if you if you have a way of getting weak
[4838.36 - 4842.92] grass and juicing fresh weak grass
[4840.52 - 4845.40] that's a that fights that helps fight
[4842.92 - 4848.00] the fight because what happens is
[4845.40 - 4850.36] there's phytochemicals and weak grass
[4848.00 - 4853.32] that when they're drawn up into a tumor
[4850.36 - 4854.96] or or absorbed by D Atri cells that
[4853.32 - 4856.72] haven't become a tumor somewhere that
[4854.96 - 4859.04] haven't even become a tum tumor or a
[4856.72 - 4862.88] lesion that happens to be active with
[4859.04 - 4866.08] cancer cells now and that we crass is B
[4862.88 - 4868.36] phytochemicals that help to suppress the
[4866.08 - 4871.44] development the
[4868.36 - 4873.00] growth so all these are important
[4871.44 - 4875.24] supplements to kill off your Epstein
[4873.00 - 4877.24] bars we talk about that all the time and
[4875.24 - 4880.16] in the Epstein bar show I did before got
[4877.24 - 4881.52] to have enough zinc in your regimen okay
[4880.16 - 4883.20] that's important the lemon bomb's
[4881.52 - 4885.96] important nettle Leaf is
[4883.20 - 4890.20] helpful vitamin C lots and lots of
[4885.96 - 4894.04] vitamin C tumors lesions cancer cells
[4890.20 - 4897.72] pre-cancerous cells virus cells hate
[4894.04 - 4900.24] vitamin C absolutely hate vitamin C I
[4897.72 - 4902.20] like the Lipo liposomal C that uh that I
[4900.24 - 4903.52] always recommend that's the one that I
[4902.20 - 4906.44] like there's a lot of different ones out
[4903.52 - 4908.64] there I don't like a lot of them um
[4906.44 - 4911.52] there's a really good one that I
[4908.64 - 4913.64] recommend that uh doesn't have corn in
[4911.52 - 4916.44] it and all the lipos Som Seas they all
[4913.64 - 4919.84] have corn in it so that's not a great
[4916.44 - 4922.04] thing so it's really important to know
[4919.84 - 4923.52] that so if you're concerned you want
[4922.04 - 4925.16] preventative or anything like that you
[4923.52 - 4927.72] do a wheat grass juice shot there's a
[4925.16 - 4930.00] company called Dynamic greens they grow
[4927.72 - 4931.20] their wheat grass in a field just like
[4930.00 - 4933.16] say grass-fed beef you know how
[4931.20 - 4934.64] everybody likes grass-fed beef because
[4933.16 - 4937.72] they like that
[4934.64 - 4940.00] more and you know the wheat grass grows
[4937.72 - 4941.88] in a field because you know it's better
[4940.00 - 4944.20] that way too so that's a and then you
[4941.88 - 4945.96] can't get a hold of the that you don't
[4944.20 - 4947.28] want that product then just go into yeah
[4945.96 - 4950.68] the health food store and get the wheat
[4947.28 - 4952.92] grass juice you need right in the moment
[4950.68 - 4954.20] but the bottom line is it's all these
[4952.92 - 4956.72] different pieces so I'm going to run
[4954.20 - 4958.88] across them it's about getting the right
[4956.72 - 4961.16] leafy greens and different green
[4958.88 - 4963.28] chlorophyll substances in you but that's
[4961.16 - 4965.28] not old that's not new information
[4963.28 - 4967.52] that's not and and I know that but
[4965.28 - 4971.36] that's okay it was
[4967.52 - 4972.96] new back in the early 70s all right when
[4971.36 - 4974.24] Spirit was telling me this is what you
[4972.96 - 4975.60] need to be on this is what you need B
[4974.24 - 4978.80] this is what you need to get and getting
[4975.60 - 4981.48] it was near impossible back then near
[4978.80 - 4984.20] impossible but the bottom line the point
[4981.48 - 4986.24] I'm trying to say is that everything's
[4984.20 - 4989.04] that are fingertips now resources like
[4986.24 - 4991.80] never before so vitamin C is really
[4989.04 - 4993.36] important um I like IV vitamin C if
[4991.80 - 4994.80] you're if you're concerned about cancer
[4993.36 - 4997.04] possibilities talk to your doctor your
[4994.80 - 4999.40] cancer doctor everybody about vitamin IV
[4997.04 - 5000.72] you know vitamin C IV that's a really
[4999.40 - 5002.56] good thing and that's been out for
[5000.72 - 5003.72] helping people with cancer we know that
[5002.56 - 5006.00] that's been out there but you can also
[5003.72 - 5008.96] take a really good lipos C if you're
[5006.00 - 5011.20] concerned which kills off Epstein bar
[5008.96 - 5013.80] knocks down Epstein bar lysine is
[5011.20 - 5015.24] important for knocking down Epstein bar
[5013.80 - 5019.24] that's another one that's really
[5015.24 - 5020.76] important um so adding all these
[5019.24 - 5022.40] different things licorice is actually
[5020.76 - 5024.12] okay too and you know you can take
[5022.40 - 5025.88] licorice once licorice tea is really
[5024.12 - 5029.12] good you can do licorice tea to help
[5025.88 - 5031.60] bring down Epstein bar um that's helpful
[5029.12 - 5032.60] in many ways one of the things is is
[5031.60 - 5034.32] that there's this whole thing thing
[5032.60 - 5035.76] going on about estrogen and estrogen be
[5034.32 - 5038.52] creating Cancers and everything else and
[5035.76 - 5041.64] then there are forms of estrogen mutated
[5038.52 - 5044.44] forms of estrogen that we ingest and we
[5041.64 - 5047.16] consume every single day we consume them
[5044.44 - 5049.28] out of foods so they come out of foods
[5047.16 - 5051.64] so we have to be careful um if you're
[5049.28 - 5053.36] really worried about an estrogenic um
[5051.64 - 5054.88] cancer then eggs you should never even
[5053.36 - 5056.60] touch I don't care if they're grown in
[5054.88 - 5059.68] somebody's backyard you shouldn't touch
[5056.60 - 5060.72] them so you you can't in milk and dairy
[5059.68 - 5062.76] products and everything else I would
[5060.72 - 5064.92] keep even in animal products down to a
[5062.76 - 5066.76] low if you're concerned about any kind
[5064.92 - 5070.60] of estrogen causing
[5066.76 - 5073.32] cancer but estrogen in its mutated form
[5070.60 - 5075.36] it's not it's not a um the woman's
[5073.32 - 5078.52] natural estrogen that's that's being
[5075.36 - 5082.28] produced by her adrenals or her
[5078.52 - 5085.16] reproductive system that grows cancer
[5082.28 - 5087.56] it's outside estrogens it's an entirely
[5085.16 - 5089.16] different estrogen but science and
[5087.56 - 5091.88] research is not separating that right
[5089.16 - 5093.12] now that's another problem we have um in
[5091.88 - 5094.64] general I mean I mean just that's a
[5093.12 - 5098.12] problem all on its
[5094.64 - 5099.56] own but anti-estrogenic Foods I'm
[5098.12 - 5101.76] talking about estrogenic foods that are
[5099.56 - 5103.04] actually the toxic ones that are out
[5101.76 - 5105.36] about that are in Plastics and
[5103.04 - 5106.92] everything else you could battle those
[5105.36 - 5108.52] with the right fruits and vegetables and
[5106.92 - 5111.28] making sure that you keep you know the
[5108.52 - 5113.60] eggs and the dairy and everything else
[5111.28 - 5116.32] down but there's little things you can
[5113.60 - 5119.08] do every day every day you can work on
[5116.32 - 5120.80] knocking down any kind of viral issue
[5119.08 - 5122.88] that you have with the right amount of
[5120.80 - 5125.68] vitamin C the lys
[5122.88 - 5129.00] and having enough zinc reserves those
[5125.68 - 5131.44] alone are important to knocking down any
[5129.00 - 5133.68] kind of herpes virus um in the herpes
[5131.44 - 5134.88] family hhv6 that create cancers epine
[5133.68 - 5138.60] bars that create
[5134.88 - 5142.60] cancers sparina knocks down and
[5138.60 - 5144.72] kills viral cells sparina can stop a
[5142.60 - 5146.44] thyroid from getting cancer by killing
[5144.72 - 5148.72] off Epstein bar and many other different
[5146.44 - 5150.64] viruses like hhv6 and the sevens the
[5148.72 - 5153.12] eights the NES the 10 11s the 12 you
[5150.64 - 5155.48] name it and all all the herpes viruses
[5153.12 - 5159.04] ceglar virus all of
[5155.48 - 5161.40] them and the simplexes one two but the
[5159.04 - 5163.56] bottom line is you can do these simple
[5161.40 - 5167.56] things get the spirulina get the vitamin
[5163.56 - 5169.64] C get the lemon bomm get the lysine you
[5167.56 - 5171.52] know that just that alone getting the
[5169.64 - 5173.08] zinc reserves up to knock down the viral
[5171.52 - 5175.64] loads and then taking the foods that
[5173.08 - 5178.28] feed the viruses out and bring in foods
[5175.64 - 5181.24] like some Dand lion greens some MH some
[5178.28 - 5184.96] kale lots of spinach spinach is an
[5181.24 - 5186.96] incredible War Warrior for for keeping
[5184.96 - 5189.20] down cancers in people's bodies and
[5186.96 - 5191.28] knocking down Epstein bar and then all
[5189.20 - 5193.64] the different fruits grapes bananas
[5191.28 - 5197.96] apples peaches plums nectarines
[5193.64 - 5200.16] cranberries melons mangoes papayas kiwis
[5197.96 - 5202.12] right down the road right down the road
[5200.16 - 5204.72] all those should be in your diet and you
[5202.12 - 5206.88] shouldn't fear them or be afraid of them
[5204.72 - 5208.84] but stay away from the table sugars stay
[5206.88 - 5210.44] away from the corn syrups because most
[5208.84 - 5211.80] of the time those corn syrups and table
[5210.44 - 5213.20] sugars aren't going to be by themselves
[5211.80 - 5216.20] you're not going going to go and get a
[5213.20 - 5217.88] vial of corn syrup and just drink it
[5216.20 - 5218.92] it's going to be in something else
[5217.88 - 5221.48] that's
[5218.92 - 5223.60] probably really helping cause a cancer
[5221.48 - 5226.04] meaning corn syrup combined with
[5223.60 - 5228.64] something that's nasty like a bad
[5226.04 - 5229.88] cupcake so we know that as far as grains
[5228.64 - 5231.44] go if you're somebody who likes them or
[5229.88 - 5233.64] don't like them you know if you have
[5231.44 - 5236.76] nothing to eat you're not wor quinoa is
[5233.64 - 5238.40] actually not cancer causing it's not it
[5236.76 - 5241.80] won't feed a cancer is what I mean it
[5238.40 - 5244.76] won't feed a viral cell Millet won't
[5241.80 - 5247.36] feed a viral cell a black bean won't
[5244.76 - 5250.44] feed a viral cell a sweet potato a
[5247.36 - 5252.40] regular potato won't feed a viral cell
[5250.44 - 5255.16] so if you just lost your eggs and your
[5252.40 - 5256.92] Dairy and you're like what do I eat now
[5255.16 - 5258.52] you can have a potato that potato is
[5256.92 - 5261.08] going to protect you a lot more than an
[5258.52 - 5262.96] egg would any day
[5261.08 - 5265.48] anyhow and if you're someone that's
[5262.96 - 5267.60] doing a lot of lot of animal protein cut
[5265.48 - 5269.32] it in half cut it in half so you can
[5267.60 - 5271.92] make room for the things that actually
[5269.32 - 5274.24] stop cancer which are all the different
[5271.92 - 5277.56] Le leafy greens and the peppers and the
[5274.24 - 5279.04] tomatoes and the onions and the garlic
[5277.56 - 5282.84] Garlic's a great secret weapon for
[5279.04 - 5285.00] Epstein bar epine bar doesn't die in one
[5282.84 - 5286.96] day and either do the other herpes
[5285.00 - 5289.84] viruses but you can knock them down over
[5286.96 - 5292.84] time and avoid cancer in the future
[5289.84 - 5295.00] avoid the thyroid cancer the lung cancer
[5292.84 - 5296.56] the reproductive cancer the ovarian
[5295.00 - 5299.68] cancer the uterine
[5296.56 - 5303.16] cancer all right and you can avoid these
[5299.68 - 5304.68] the breast cancer can be avoided
[5303.16 - 5306.28] heavy metal detox and all the different
[5304.68 - 5310.68] fresh fruits and vegetables and leafy
[5306.28 - 5315.52] greens help to eliminate toxins and
[5310.68 - 5317.56] poisons so that you can't feed viruses
[5315.52 - 5319.48] and get end up with some of the cancers
[5317.56 - 5322.24] like breast cancer so all these are
[5319.48 - 5324.44] incredibly important factors what I
[5322.24 - 5328.60] would do is you know listen out for more
[5324.44 - 5330.08] stuff about the Epstein bar that I do on
[5328.60 - 5331.76] on the radio shows and stuff like that
[5330.08 - 5333.76] and I'll fill you in more more more of
[5331.76 - 5336.60] that as well along the
[5333.76 - 5337.80] way but I want to talk about a little
[5336.60 - 5339.16] history for a couple of minutes though
[5337.80 - 5342.40] about the epscene bar and some of the
[5339.16 - 5346.76] viruses they took off route back in the
[5342.40 - 5349.32] late 1800s early 1900s because of all
[5346.76 - 5351.08] the different arsenic combinations and
[5349.32 - 5354.00] all the different antibiotic Creations
[5351.08 - 5356.32] that were starting pre-antibiotic
[5354.00 - 5358.20] era that were all starting and they were
[5356.32 - 5361.60] using they're testing new fungicides and
[5358.20 - 5363.60] new antibiotics on food purposely all
[5361.60 - 5364.96] through the late 1800s and early 1900s
[5363.60 - 5366.68] so we were getting a tremendous amount
[5364.96 - 5370.84] of early poison in that day which
[5366.68 - 5373.88] actually fueled a very benign
[5370.84 - 5375.76] non-destructive viral cell that grew
[5373.88 - 5377.56] into something more over the decades
[5375.76 - 5379.72] through the 1900s and that's why it's to
[5377.56 - 5382.48] the point it is now and I talk about
[5379.72 - 5383.16] that a lot on the Epstein bar shows that
[5382.48 - 5385.28] I
[5383.16 - 5388.16] do
[5385.28 - 5390.12] um prayer is important keep that in your
[5388.16 - 5391.76] heart and soul all right and pat
[5390.12 - 5393.24] yourself on the back take it easy if you
[5391.76 - 5395.28] know know someone suffering or going
[5393.24 - 5398.28] through something know that you can do
[5395.28 - 5401.16] so much you can do so many great things
[5398.28 - 5402.60] and you can do so many good things and
[5401.16 - 5404.04] we take it one day at a time and we
[5402.60 - 5405.52] start getting the different supplements
[5404.04 - 5407.48] and I want to go across while we still
[5405.52 - 5410.72] have time a few more supplements
[5407.48 - 5412.96] too and um there's some supplements I
[5410.72 - 5415.08] like I love turmeric I love curcumin
[5412.96 - 5418.08] that's great I love coenzyme Q10 I love
[5415.08 - 5420.20] that I love ala okay for helping prevent
[5418.08 - 5423.96] cancers helping people along with their
[5420.20 - 5425.56] immune systems I do like bees it's one
[5423.96 - 5427.60] thing that you'll hear out there is all
[5425.56 - 5430.36] the bees feed
[5427.60 - 5433.20] cancers but when you
[5430.36 - 5435.40] minus the when you bring down the viral
[5433.20 - 5436.88] load down in your bodies when people
[5435.40 - 5438.68] bring down the viral load down and you
[5436.88 - 5442.60] bring down the toxic load everywhere
[5438.68 - 5444.64] else a B vitamin will not be harmful and
[5442.60 - 5449.12] that is misinformation about bees it
[5444.64 - 5452.00] just so happens they find B vitamin in
[5449.12 - 5454.44] some cancer tumors and they have the
[5452.00 - 5457.12] discovered that but they've also found
[5454.44 - 5459.04] every mineral and many vitamins and
[5457.12 - 5461.84] nutrients that happen to accidentally
[5459.04 - 5463.92] get up there because the the cancer
[5461.84 - 5467.04] tumors and and the cells don't want
[5463.92 - 5469.96] those it just so happens those th those
[5467.04 - 5472.44] nutrients get delivered they don't feed
[5469.96 - 5474.00] the tumor and they don't grow the tumor
[5472.44 - 5475.60] the tumors and the cancer cells they
[5474.00 - 5477.60] just want to go through this vitamin B
[5475.60 - 5481.96] the thing a little bit with you guys
[5477.60 - 5483.68] while we can um tumors grow from all the
[5481.96 - 5484.96] other things they talked about all the
[5483.68 - 5487.20] other things that it likes and the
[5484.96 - 5490.12] cancers like and the viral cells and the
[5487.20 - 5492.76] viral cancers like that's what tumers
[5490.12 - 5496.56] grow on they don't
[5492.76 - 5499.44] grow on vitamin B by itself you know all
[5496.56 - 5501.00] the vitamin B's by themselves they don't
[5499.44 - 5503.32] and they don't grow on a mineral by
[5501.00 - 5505.48] itself and they don't grow on a nutrient
[5503.32 - 5507.52] or a vitamin by itself and all those can
[5505.48 - 5511.40] be traces of all those could be found in
[5507.52 - 5513.44] cancers because it goes up the the it
[5511.40 - 5515.92] goes up up the chot it goes up the
[5513.44 - 5517.52] androgenesis it goes up the tentacles
[5515.92 - 5518.92] and it also goes into lesions it goes
[5517.52 - 5520.88] into different different cancers and
[5518.92 - 5522.24] different Fabrics of you know all that
[5520.88 - 5524.88] and it gets into different connected
[5522.24 - 5527.12] tissue cancers and everything else and
[5524.88 - 5529.40] so as it's going up in there there are
[5527.12 - 5531.88] traces that are found and a mistake is
[5529.40 - 5534.00] made about how Vitamin B's are really
[5531.88 - 5536.24] dangerous with a cancer it's not
[5534.00 - 5538.36] accurate it's all the foods and all the
[5536.24 - 5541.56] poisons that the tumor relies on
[5538.36 - 5544.72] Non-Stop someone can avoid a little bit
[5541.56 - 5547.08] of B12 or they could avoid a you know
[5544.72 - 5549.44] methola but they're eating eggs every
[5547.08 - 5551.36] day while they're dealing with a Cancer
[5549.44 - 5553.08] and that's what I'm talking about
[5551.36 - 5555.40] critical and subtle differences of
[5553.08 - 5557.44] understanding this stuff that's
[5555.40 - 5559.40] important so I just want to give you
[5557.44 - 5562.08] example too I mean people literally eat
[5559.40 - 5564.48] eggs all day long or every day three
[5562.08 - 5566.40] eggs a day one egg a day and they're
[5564.48 - 5567.80] avoiding a B vitamin that can help
[5566.40 - 5569.68] protect their nervous system and other
[5567.80 - 5570.96] parts of their body so they could stay
[5569.68 - 5572.76] strong protect their immune system so
[5570.96 - 5575.44] they could stay strong
[5572.76 - 5577.24] so that's another aspect of of what one
[5575.44 - 5578.96] of the misunderstandings is going out
[5577.24 - 5581.44] there I mean you don't have to OD on the
[5578.96 - 5582.68] bees you can take a little bit you just
[5581.44 - 5584.08] don't want to go to fishing and never
[5582.68 - 5585.36] take a B vitamin because you're afraid
[5584.08 - 5587.72] it's going to feed a cancer you can take
[5585.36 - 5590.24] a little bit of B
[5587.72 - 5592.56] vitamins so that's one other thing now
[5590.24 - 5594.68] in the herbal world I love a lot of
[5592.56 - 5598.16] different herbs for fighting
[5594.68 - 5602.36] cancer here's the thing every single
[5598.16 - 5605.16] herb does fight cancer every single herb
[5602.36 - 5608.80] has phytochemicals within it that does
[5605.16 - 5612.00]  and fight cancer it does suppress
[5608.80 - 5613.96] stop slows down or fights or kills some
[5612.00 - 5616.96] cancers every single
[5613.96 - 5621.56] herb so I like Elder
[5616.96 - 5622.76] flow um crysanthemum flower I love these
[5621.56 - 5627.28] I even like
[5622.76 - 5629.92] Elderberry Elderberry is great rose hips
[5627.28 - 5633.56] amazing for really helping with
[5629.92 - 5635.88] Cancers all right you Yaro berock root
[5633.56 - 5640.00] dandelion root little bits of that like
[5635.88 - 5642.60] some tea could be really helpful Yaro
[5640.00 - 5645.32] that's another great one Mullen Leaf
[5642.60 - 5647.92] it's another one too so all these herbs
[5645.32 - 5649.44] are really helpful and really wonderful
[5647.92 - 5651.12] so if you're a practitioner too and you
[5649.44 - 5652.68] want to try a different herb ibrite
[5651.12 - 5655.08] that's a great one and like of course I
[5652.68 - 5656.56] said before nettle Leaf lemon Bal those
[5655.08 - 5658.84] are great as
[5656.56 - 5661.32] well so these are some of the herbs that
[5658.84 - 5664.00] you can you know think about red root is
[5661.32 - 5667.56] a good one too that helps and that's a
[5664.00 - 5669.12] good one as well so think about those
[5667.56 - 5670.52] and incorporating some of those but
[5669.12 - 5672.04] fresh fruits and vegetables no matter
[5670.52 - 5674.56] what Avenue you go whether you go
[5672.04 - 5675.92] Chinese medicine or you go to just a
[5674.56 - 5677.16] different alternative doctor or you go
[5675.92 - 5678.48] straight to a conventional doctor or
[5677.16 - 5680.32] whatever it is that you're doing or you
[5678.48 - 5683.16] know somebody bring in the more fruits
[5680.32 - 5684.88] and vegetables lower the animal proteins
[5683.16 - 5687.44] a bit if you just can't do without the
[5684.88 - 5689.64] animal proteins have them once a day I
[5687.44 - 5691.56] stand behind that but bring in some of
[5689.64 - 5694.68] these other foods that I mentioned today
[5691.56 - 5697.52] and um so a little recap we talked about
[5694.68 - 5701.60] how it takes a virus and it takes these
[5697.52 - 5705.92] toxins to create a cancer but viruses
[5701.60 - 5708.40] cancers are almost all all viral so when
[5705.92 - 5710.04] you really look at it it's all viral and
[5708.40 - 5714.28] that's something that's always been kept
[5710.04 - 5716.20] in the dark and kept in the closet so
[5714.28 - 5718.04] always remember that you know most I
[5716.20 - 5723.28] mean literally most and I'm talking
[5718.04 - 5726.00] about most every single cancer is viral
[5723.28 - 5727.36] that's that's the whole point now um and
[5726.00 - 5729.72] there's people like look just a little
[5727.36 - 5732.40] reminder again there's people that don't
[5729.72 - 5734.68] get any viral sickness like they maybe
[5732.40 - 5735.96] experience mono from Epstein bar when
[5734.68 - 5738.80] they're younger and then it goes away
[5735.96 - 5739.96] and they don't exper you know they never
[5738.80 - 5741.48] they don't have the chronic fatigue they
[5739.96 - 5743.64] don't have the fibromyalgia that I talk
[5741.48 - 5745.80] about all the time that that epine bar
[5743.64 - 5747.44] causes and they don't have that but then
[5745.80 - 5749.56] a cancer can still develop later on
[5747.44 - 5750.88] because the viruses could be a little
[5749.56 - 5752.40] bit different there's still all these
[5750.88 - 5753.92] different Vari ities of Epstein bar
[5752.40 - 5755.52] talked about and different varieties so
[5753.92 - 5757.16] recapping different varieties of the
[5755.52 - 5759.52] hhv6 different varieties of all these
[5757.16 - 5761.56] different viruses and especially epsteen
[5759.52 - 5763.72] bar the Epstein bar is in you know
[5761.56 - 5765.20] that's the spotlight right now you know
[5763.72 - 5767.36] that's the spotlight right now that that
[5765.20 - 5769.52] I'm bringing that I've actually brought
[5767.36 - 5771.16] to the world like if if you look at my
[5769.52 - 5773.68] uh look if you want to know more about
[5771.16 - 5776.60] Epstein bar you get the first book
[5773.68 - 5779.28] medical medium but just so you know the
[5776.60 - 5782.20] thyroid healing book that one right
[5779.28 - 5784.52] there is is even taking it to a whole
[5782.20 - 5786.28] another level too but I always say to
[5784.52 - 5787.52] people look you need both you need
[5786.28 - 5789.44] medical medium books so you can learn
[5787.52 - 5791.04] about the viruses how they work how they
[5789.44 - 5793.40] get into the thyroid the whole bit but
[5791.04 - 5797.20] the thyroid healing book takes it to a
[5793.40 - 5799.44] level that no one's ever seen and even
[5797.20 - 5800.96] the first book no one's ever seen that I
[5799.44 - 5802.32] took it to that level but this is a
[5800.96 - 5804.68] whole another thing so I tell people you
[5802.32 - 5807.00] have to have both and then I I also when
[5804.68 - 5810.32] it comes down to cancers in the
[5807.00 - 5814.08] life-changing Foods book um I mean I
[5810.32 - 5817.84] have easily over 60 70 cancers 50
[5814.08 - 5821.16] cancers um easy 50 that's for sure Plus
[5817.84 - 5823.28] in there and and what foods help all the
[5821.16 - 5824.72] different cancers so you know what foods
[5823.28 - 5826.20] whether it's lung cancer liver cancer
[5824.72 - 5828.40] whether it's leukemia whatever it is
[5826.20 - 5831.24] what foods help too with all those
[5828.40 - 5833.52] different cancers so you know I I do
[5831.24 - 5835.72] have cancer information throughout the
[5833.52 - 5838.28] books the thyroid healing book takes the
[5835.72 - 5841.52] viral information even further than ever
[5838.28 - 5843.52] before in history uh at least iCal
[5841.52 - 5845.28] medium history of course and history on
[5843.52 - 5846.84] the outside as well so it's really
[5845.28 - 5850.52] important to understand so
[5846.84 - 5852.72] recapping cancers are viral and that's
[5850.52 - 5854.84] the whole point and and that's what's
[5852.72 - 5856.52] been hidden and it's about how that
[5854.84 - 5859.64] virus like I talked about earlier how
[5856.52 - 5862.16] that virus starts and what it does it
[5859.64 - 5864.08] bring it starts and then it roots and
[5862.16 - 5865.80] then it turns into something more and I
[5864.08 - 5868.32] talked about how you need the toxins
[5865.80 - 5869.52] that's the other half of it but but yet
[5868.32 - 5870.68] you know if someone doesn't have the
[5869.52 - 5873.08] viral issue if they don't have the
[5870.68 - 5874.88] Epstein bar the variety of Epstein bar
[5873.08 - 5876.64] the mutated variety of Epstein bar out
[5874.88 - 5879.52] of all the different 60 varieties I talk
[5876.64 - 5881.80] about in medical medium book one if if
[5879.52 - 5883.68] you don't have that going on and you
[5881.80 - 5885.32] just have the toxins then you can get
[5883.68 - 5887.76] you know kind of sick in a different way
[5885.32 - 5890.44] that's not cancerous you can still get a
[5887.76 - 5893.24] benign tumor you can still get a lipoma
[5890.44 - 5895.40] a fatty tumor and you can still get all
[5893.24 - 5897.96] these different things or or other kinds
[5895.40 - 5900.96] of sicknesses too be from having you
[5897.96 - 5903.00] know constant exposure to so many toxins
[5900.96 - 5905.16] and and it's like I was saying before
[5903.00 - 5907.20] just you know recapping on like the lung
[5905.16 - 5910.20] cancer thing too is somebody could smoke
[5907.20 - 5912.16] for 50 60 years and not get lung cancer
[5910.20 - 5914.08] somebody else smokes for four years and
[5912.16 - 5917.88] gets lung cancer they have to you to
[5914.08 - 5920.52] have the virus has to be around and so
[5917.88 - 5923.56] that all that's important to understand
[5920.52 - 5925.44] um but you know keep in mind if you you
[5923.56 - 5927.64] know to to Really you know hook into
[5925.44 - 5929.80] some of the there's a 28-day cleanse on
[5927.64 - 5931.80] medical medium book one on the book
[5929.80 - 5935.00] medical medium there's a 28 cleanse
[5931.80 - 5937.12] that's amazing for cancer really really
[5935.00 - 5939.12] powerful for cancer and the reason why
[5937.12 - 5942.88] I'm bringing this up and bringing all
[5939.12 - 5945.16] the books up is because what what you
[5942.88 - 5946.92] have to keep in mind to protect yourself
[5945.16 - 5948.40] from these Cancers and to protect
[5946.92 - 5950.80] yourself from ever getting them or if
[5948.40 - 5953.20] you have them you know getting you need
[5950.80 - 5956.08] that reinforcement you have to empty the
[5953.20 - 5958.44] body of the toxins I talked about all
[5956.08 - 5961.44] the leftover toxins we inherit and I
[5958.44 - 5963.36] might not have expressed that earlier um
[5961.44 - 5965.56] in this webinar about how we inherit
[5963.36 - 5969.12] these toxins heavy metals are passed
[5965.56 - 5971.92] down for thousands of years thousands of
[5969.12 - 5974.28] years in our family line it's not genes
[5971.92 - 5976.76] that take us down it's not a gene
[5974.28 - 5979.20] problem our forefathers have mercury in
[5976.76 - 5982.92] them our forefathers have led Mercury
[5979.20 - 5984.28]  nickel um aluminum it going back
[5982.92 - 5987.60] especially Mercury that's that's
[5984.28 - 5989.84] actually one of the oldest and so we
[5987.60 - 5992.92] inherit these metals and then we inherit
[5989.84 - 5995.80] DDT from the 19 1920s 1930s when DDT
[5992.92 - 5997.60] saturated everybody and DDT doesn't go
[5995.80 - 5999.92] away you pass it on to your you pass it
[5997.60 - 6002.96] on to your children just right just just
[5999.92 - 6005.08] from the pregnancy itself literally um
[6002.96 - 6006.68] and and it starts there right in the egg
[6005.08 - 6008.88] right in the pregnancy itself right
[6006.68 - 6011.20] there and that DDT is passed on and that
[6008.88 - 6012.60] DDT comes from being saturated same
[6011.20 - 6014.24] thing with all the chemicals and all the
[6012.60 - 6017.16] solvents and everything else and we're
[6014.24 - 6021.16] passing down a tremendous amount of
[6017.16 - 6023.16] toxin unlike ever before in history and
[6021.16 - 6025.16] then it gets blamed on jeans because
[6023.16 - 6027.44] remember it has to be blamed on you like
[6025.16 - 6030.40] I said earlier it has to be blamed on
[6027.44 - 6032.92] you and the blame has to go on you and
[6030.40 - 6034.76] not the mistakes made not all the
[6032.92 - 6037.20] industries including the medical
[6034.76 - 6039.48] industry and all the other Industries
[6037.20 - 6040.72] because you know that's the whole point
[6039.48 - 6042.16] so it's going to be thrown you're going
[6040.72 - 6043.76] to be thrown into the genetic game
[6042.16 - 6045.84] everybody's going to be thrown in that
[6043.76 - 6047.56] and I know there's first of all I know
[6045.84 - 6049.40] genes are obviously real they're
[6047.56 - 6051.48] valuable in so many ways and they're
[6049.40 - 6054.92] valuable in science I'm not
[6051.48 - 6057.64] debunking that factor but I am telling
[6054.92 - 6059.52] you that they're going to also use genes
[6057.64 - 6061.40] against you when they shouldn't because
[6059.52 - 6063.72] it's not part of the equation in certain
[6061.40 - 6065.52] areas and remember I tell you at the I
[6063.72 - 6067.44] told you at the very beginning there's
[6065.52 - 6070.36] subtle and
[6067.44 - 6072.28] critical differences the critical
[6070.36 - 6074.12] differences one is yes genes are
[6072.28 - 6076.60] important to study in science and they
[6074.12 - 6078.24] matter in in many different ways but
[6076.60 - 6081.36] it's not why everybody's getting sick
[6078.24 - 6083.56] with cancer right now it's not it's from
[6081.36 - 6086.04] all this all these toxins literally
[6083.56 - 6088.88] being passed down and amplifying and
[6086.04 - 6090.52] adding more more like never before in
[6088.88 - 6092.48] history the thousands of chemicals that
[6090.52 - 6094.12] are falling out of the sky every day on
[6092.48 - 6095.88] us and everything else and that's just a
[6094.12 - 6097.96] fraction of what I'm talking about and
[6095.88 - 6101.04] so and including the inheriting the
[6097.96 - 6103.60] inheriting the amount of poison and then
[6101.04 - 6106.68] the inher inheriting of viruses that
[6103.60 - 6108.60] have grown in strength so if if you know
[6106.68 - 6112.04] if your if your grandmother had breast
[6108.60 - 6114.28] cancer it's possible yes it's not a gene
[6112.04 - 6116.36] thing that occurs where now you're going
[6114.28 - 6118.24] to be genetically you know susceptible
[6116.36 - 6121.16] no it's the virus that could have been
[6118.24 - 6122.92] passed down and it could it these
[6121.16 - 6124.48] viruses have information they stay alive
[6122.92 - 6126.08] and they have memory unless you kill
[6124.48 - 6127.48] them unless you kill them and break them
[6126.08 - 6129.48] down and work on it and that's what I
[6127.48 - 6131.56] dedicated the first book medical medium
[6129.48 - 6133.20] and I dedicated thyroid healing for
[6131.56 - 6135.64] breaking down these viruses and doing
[6133.20 - 6137.72] the right things to knock the stuff down
[6135.64 - 6140.24] knock the Epstein bar down and and take
[6137.72 - 6141.96] it out and push it out of the body so
[6140.24 - 6144.96] these things are incredible all this
[6141.96 - 6147.00] information is imperative to know that
[6144.96 - 6149.04] we inherit these poisons we inherit many
[6147.00 - 6151.68] of the viruses and so forth but there is
[6149.04 - 6154.16] someone to blame and it's not you and so
[6151.68 - 6155.68] when you lose a loved one with cancer or
[6154.16 - 6157.36] something happens where someone had you
[6155.68 - 6160.48] know a loved one has or a child has
[6157.36 - 6162.76] leukemia it's not their body you know
[6160.48 - 6164.84] children with leukemia have tons of
[6162.76 - 6166.72] mercury much higher amount of mercury
[6164.84 - 6169.08] they have the heavy metals number one
[6166.72 - 6170.76] they also have the monov virus the one
[6169.08 - 6173.64] that creates leukemia that I talk about
[6170.76 - 6176.04] about in book one medical medium and
[6173.64 - 6178.12] that virus starts out the leukemia
[6176.04 - 6179.60] Factor that's the whole point and that's
[6178.12 - 6181.16] what's going on that's why there's so
[6179.60 - 6182.24] many different now leukemias that
[6181.16 - 6184.52] they're figuring out they don't even
[6182.24 - 6186.84] know what to do they just use they do
[6184.52 - 6188.16] the chemotherapy for leukemia because
[6186.84 - 6189.88] and then they're using also different
[6188.16 - 6191.92] drugs like immunosuppressive drugs and
[6189.88 - 6194.04] chemotherapy together because they don't
[6191.92 - 6196.80] they don't understand that it literally
[6194.04 - 6198.84] is the Epstein bar virus that creates
[6196.80 - 6200.76] leukemia and and many of the children
[6198.84 - 6204.04] they they don't know that part to that
[6200.76 - 6206.84] agree yet and a recap as I said before
[6204.04 - 6208.92] cancer is only judged on the merits of
[6206.84 - 6212.00] its manifesting already turning into
[6208.92 - 6213.96] something already being something and
[6212.00 - 6215.64] not like catching it way before so when
[6213.96 - 6216.88] you hear about you know cancer
[6215.64 - 6219.00] preventative and everything else from
[6216.88 - 6221.92] experts and all that if they're not
[6219.00 - 6224.40] talking about what we talked about today
[6221.92 - 6226.52] in this webinar if they're not talking
[6224.40 - 6228.48] about the information we're talking
[6226.52 - 6230.32] about how it really starts how the how
[6228.48 - 6232.44] the virus poisons the tissue and
[6230.32 - 6234.36] everything else that the remanufacturing
[6232.44 - 6237.68] the poison everything else that you guys
[6234.36 - 6239.40] now know the truth the real truth the
[6237.68 - 6241.44] real truth when we say truth out there
[6239.40 - 6243.92] it doesn't mean it's all truth or
[6241.44 - 6245.68] exactly the truth and that's another
[6243.92 - 6247.92] problem too and so we can get sucked
[6245.68 - 6250.60] into it real easy so the thyroid healing
[6247.92 - 6253.24] book when it says truth about Hashimoto
[6250.60 - 6256.80] on that book it's really the truth about
[6253.24 - 6259.28] Hashimoto not not information and
[6256.80 - 6261.88] studies that had interest groups behind
[6259.28 - 6263.40] it okay and Kickbacks and medical
[6261.88 - 6265.08] funding and everything else that had to
[6263.40 - 6267.28] make something come out a certain way
[6265.08 - 6270.24] the cake just come out just right
[6267.28 - 6272.44] because so much was at stake and and you
[6270.24 - 6274.36] know angled a certain way it's like the
[6272.44 - 6277.24] whole thing with the sugar thing you
[6274.36 - 6280.52] know corn syrup can yeah can instigate
[6277.24 - 6283.64] cancer cells but no one studied a piece
[6280.52 - 6286.24] of fruit with the cancer killing
[6283.64 - 6289.48] phytochemicals within the sugar combine
[6286.24 - 6292.52] that's never been put to a lab or test
[6289.48 - 6295.00] to show how it kills cancer cells so
[6292.52 - 6298.60] then all Sugar's ostracized because of
[6295.00 - 6300.96] it all sugar is is is you know is is is
[6298.60 - 6303.00] is called wrong when it's really the
[6300.96 - 6305.68] things that you know we need to actually
[6303.00 - 6308.56] cure cancer help with cancer the in the
[6305.68 - 6310.60] it's in there and so these
[6308.56 - 6313.28] phytochemicals so it's all about the
[6310.60 - 6315.12] studies being twisted and bodged and
[6313.28 - 6318.60] everything else is said the very
[6315.12 - 6320.00] beginning in the opening you guys and so
[6318.60 - 6321.60] because of that when we deal with the
[6320.00 - 6323.60] truth and thyroid healing says it's the
[6321.60 - 6325.20] truth about Hashimoto you you're going
[6323.60 - 6326.84] to have to you're definitely going to
[6325.20 - 6328.76] have to have your cam te with you when
[6326.84 - 6330.28] you read that book because you're your
[6328.76 - 6333.80] eyeballs are going to just they're going
[6330.28 - 6336.28] to pop out in a good way in a good way
[6333.80 - 6338.88] as you're reading that and you're you're
[6336.28 - 6341.28] going to be like oh my God and so you
[6338.88 - 6343.04] need to understand all this uh So you
[6341.28 - 6345.40] you're you're you got the armor you got
[6343.04 - 6348.76] the protection so you're you're guarded
[6345.40 - 6351.68] in a safe way you know the whole point
[6348.76 - 6353.36] is look we have have to protect you
[6351.68 - 6356.24] that's the whole point and that's what
[6353.36 - 6357.72] I've always done since I was a child so
[6356.24 - 6359.84] I want to talk about the foods a little
[6357.72 - 6363.20] bit too a little bit more about the
[6359.84 - 6365.28] foods chaga mushroom fantastic chaga
[6363.20 - 6366.72] mushroom reishi mushroom that's another
[6365.28 - 6369.40] thing that's great for cancers now and
[6366.72 - 6370.64] that information's out there that is but
[6369.40 - 6372.56] I still have to remind you of some of
[6370.64 - 6373.64] the things that are out there uh and
[6372.56 - 6375.16] some of the things that I've been using
[6373.64 - 6376.96] before that information got out there
[6375.16 - 6379.16] once again like the like the reishi
[6376.96 - 6381.24] mushroom I'm going back since I was 8
[6379.16 - 6383.56] years old I was telling people to use
[6381.24 - 6385.36] reishi mushroom for cancer and nobody
[6383.56 - 6390.04] even knew what that was or how to get it
[6385.36 - 6391.40] it was unbelievable Corps um Lion's man
[6390.04 - 6393.60] those are all great I want to cover
[6391.40 - 6395.40] juicing a little bit more deeper um
[6393.60 - 6396.96] asparagus juice now here's how the
[6395.40 - 6398.84] juicing Works to really help with
[6396.96 - 6401.00] Cancers preventing cancer helping with
[6398.84 - 6402.12] everything so anything you're doing in
[6401.00 - 6404.28] your regime whether you're getting
[6402.12 - 6406.48] chemotherapy whether you're getting uh
[6404.28 - 6408.76] you know radiation uh um you know
[6406.48 - 6410.56] synchronized radiation uh blast the
[6408.76 - 6412.08] whole bit that that we do they l they're
[6410.56 - 6413.56] doing better with radiation now they'd
[6412.08 - 6415.40] ever did before even though you know a
[6413.56 - 6417.84] lot of people are against it some people
[6415.40 - 6419.96] hate it some people like it it's it's
[6417.84 - 6422.04] just you know it it's complicated every
[6419.96 - 6423.64] bit about it everybody's different every
[6422.04 - 6425.48] doctor's different every Clinic is
[6423.64 - 6426.88] different too so wherever you're going
[6425.48 - 6428.20] whether it's the natural clinics where
[6426.88 - 6430.24] you're just getting nothing but
[6428.20 - 6431.80] intravenous or you're getting um a
[6430.24 - 6433.60] combination of a holistic Clinic that's
[6431.80 - 6436.92] doing some chemotherapy plus other
[6433.60 - 6440.40] things whatever it is juicing can fit
[6436.92 - 6443.28] into any of those places to help you
[6440.40 - 6446.16] either prevent cancer um if you or or
[6443.28 - 6449.52] combat it or help reverse it or whatever
[6446.16 - 6452.04] whatever you need so so in the juicing I
[6449.52 - 6454.96] like a base in the juice the base
[6452.04 - 6456.92] meaning it could be apple yes Apple
[6454.96 - 6458.56] believe it or not okay CU I know that
[6456.92 - 6461.24] you know that's shunned in so many
[6458.56 - 6463.48] situations which it shouldn't be on any
[6461.24 - 6465.40] level it I mean there's so many cancer
[6463.48 - 6468.68] fighting properties in an apple it's
[6465.40 - 6470.12] insane so a little bit of Apple celery
[6468.68 - 6472.64] which is a secret weapon that should be
[6470.12 - 6474.88] a strong base cucumber could be a base
[6472.64 - 6477.36] too now if you can just do plain celery
[6474.88 - 6478.84] as your base you can do plain cucumber
[6477.36 - 6481.36] as your base or apple but here's the
[6478.84 - 6483.72] trick now it's adding it's adding the
[6481.36 - 6485.84] accents on top of this so what I like to
[6483.72 - 6488.76] do for cancers is and real cancer
[6485.84 - 6490.84] preventative as you do your you do you
[6488.76 - 6493.52] know a good half celery juice you could
[6490.84 - 6495.00] you know good 10 12 ounces or 16 ounces
[6493.52 - 6498.24] of celery juice whatever and then you
[6495.00 - 6500.80] run some asparagus in you only need a
[6498.24 - 6502.84] few ounces of
[6500.80 - 6504.80] you know the the addition so asparagus
[6502.84 - 6507.80] is one of them asparagus is one of the
[6504.80 - 6509.80] the greatest cancer Fighters out there
[6507.80 - 6511.80] so always remember that so you can do
[6509.80 - 6513.96] this juice where you're juicing your
[6511.80 - 6516.04] celery you got a nice glass of celery or
[6513.96 - 6519.08] celery apple or cucumber and then you

[6640.88 - 6646.24] planet Earth right here and um and you
[6644.16 - 6648.08] know always remember that so that should
[6646.24 - 6649.84] be in your smoothies the heavy metal

[6649.84 - 6654.16] that at you um make sure that's a a
[6652.56 - 6656.16] piece of it all because you're pulling
[6654.16 - 6658.12] out heavy metals and other toxins and
[6656.16 - 6660.80] other dioxins never underestimate the
[6658.12 - 6662.96] power of cilantro in the heavy metal
[6660.80 - 6665.28] detox and you can do cilantro in your
[6662.96 - 6667.56] juices too and when but when you do the
[6665.28 - 6670.04] heavy metal detox the barley grass juice
[6667.56 - 6672.72] powder and you know you got your
[6670.04 - 6674.04] spirulina and you got your cilantro and
[6672.72 - 6676.56] you got your wild blueberries and your
[6674.04 - 6678.04] douls don't underestimate the power of
[6676.56 - 6680.16] those those not only take out heavy
[6678.04 - 6681.72] metals and the wild blueberries I said I
[6680.16 - 6684.68] said that already they not only take the
[6681.72 - 6687.08] heavy metals out but they take Plastics
[6684.68 - 6689.04] out they take DDT out in the liver
[6687.08 - 6691.60] that's been there long before you were
[6689.04 - 6694.12] born meaning in your in your parents and
[6691.60 - 6696.28] in their parents takes out all kinds of
[6694.12 - 6698.76] things chemical solvents from carpets
[6696.28 - 6700.92] from rugs from you know just anything
[6698.76 - 6703.40] that you've gotten into you throughout
[6700.92 - 6706.44] the years that is feeding the original
[6703.40 - 6708.88] viruses that start up cancer and so
[6706.44 - 6710.60] don't underestimate that the power of
[6708.88 - 6715.52] that as well
[6710.60 - 6718.56] uh always remember that so um and hey
[6715.52 - 6721.24] look uh bottom line is when you get that
[6718.56 - 6723.24] copy of thyroid healing in your hands
[6721.24 - 6726.04] you're going to have more information
[6723.24 - 6728.04] than you just ever thought existed and
[6726.04 - 6729.92] I'm really excited about that I would
[6728.04 - 6731.84] get medical medium because I got the 28
[6729.92 - 6734.00] day cleanse which I love for cancer
[6731.84 - 6735.80] always have it's it's incredible for for
[6734.00 - 6738.80] helping people with cancer because what
[6735.80 - 6740.84] it does thins out the blood gets oxygen
[6738.80 - 6743.52] oxygen in places where cancer doesn't
[6740.84 - 6746.04] want oxygen and that's what I really
[6743.52 - 6747.60] like and so no matter what your diet is
[6746.04 - 6749.52] you know whatever your diet is too you
[6747.60 - 6751.48] can always do a 28- day cleanse to
[6749.52 - 6754.84] really support yourself protect yourself
[6751.48 - 6756.08] and have that extra extra bonus um you
[6754.84 - 6757.36] know if you're dealing with Cancers or
[6756.08 - 6759.12] anything like that keep your diet
[6757.36 - 6760.80] relatively lowfat if you love animal
[6759.12 - 6763.36] products like I said you know just you
[6760.80 - 6766.08] know keep them don't don't be you know
[6763.36 - 6768.32] don't do the bacon in the morning the
[6766.08 - 6769.64] the eggs for lunch the eggs and tuna for
[6768.32 - 6770.88] lunch and then you know you move and
[6769.64 - 6772.48] then dinner time lots of chicken and
[6770.88 - 6775.00] beef try to pick one of those things
[6772.48 - 6777.04] just don't do the eggs of course and um
[6775.00 - 6778.48] because you want your blood not so fat I
[6777.04 - 6780.16] have nothing against animal products
[6778.48 - 6784.00] it's just that you don't want the blood
[6780.16 - 6786.24] so thick so thick and pasty that oxygen
[6784.00 - 6788.96] and nutrients can't get phytochemicals
[6786.24 - 6791.44] that stop cancer can't get to tumors to
[6788.96 - 6794.16] cysts to lesions to tissue that needs to
[6791.44 - 6795.96] repair itself and and that's really
[6794.16 - 6798.12] important to understand regardless of
[6795.96 - 6799.52] what experts say out there and like I
[6798.12 - 6801.32] said before some of the stuff is going
[6799.52 - 6804.64] to be something completely opposite to
[6801.32 - 6807.40] what you've heard what you've known but
[6804.64 - 6809.48] you know I've seen success for decades
[6807.40 - 6812.04] proven success for decades and decades
[6809.48 - 6814.60] with all illnesses so so we we like to
[6812.04 - 6817.40] give people what they need for sure and
[6814.60 - 6820.36] um look when you knock your viral load
[6817.40 - 6824.12] down when you knock that Epstein bar
[6820.36 - 6825.84] down that res that sits in so many of us
[6824.12 - 6829.36] when you knock that down you knock down
[6825.84 - 6832.92] other viruses that could be trouble um
[6829.36 - 6835.44] you take take control you actually take
[6832.92 - 6838.20] control and it moves you forward you
[6835.44 - 6840.16] take control into a place of healing
[6838.20 - 6841.76] that you didn't even know existed
[6840.16 - 6845.08] meaning giving you protection for the
[6841.76 - 6846.64] future your future self your future self
[6845.08 - 6847.76] because you know we look at ourselves in
[6846.64 - 6849.20] the future we don't want to see
[6847.76 - 6851.80] ourselves sick we don't want to see
[6849.20 - 6854.84] ourselves dealing with with a cancer or
[6851.80 - 6856.48] fibromyalgia or ra or all these things I
[6854.84 - 6858.60] talk about Epstein bar creates and
[6856.48 - 6860.80] causes or Hashimoto or whatever it is
[6858.60 - 6863.12] you know I you don't want to have to see
[6860.80 - 6865.80] yourself sick in the future and so you
[6863.12 - 6869.28] want to knock your viral loads down and
[6865.80 - 6872.72] that's what a part of all this is too so
[6869.28 - 6876.60] keep in mind um with all all of
[6872.72 - 6878.24] everything I said today and um and yeah
[6876.60 - 6880.16] we move forward and that's the bottom
[6878.24 - 6883.80] line we move forward so I think this
[6880.16 - 6885.64] concludes at least one part one part and
[6883.80 - 6887.52] look we're going to be doing a lot more
[6885.64 - 6888.88] than this so just please listen out
[6887.52 - 6890.12] because we're going to we're going to be
[6888.88 - 6891.60] doing more than this and going to go in
[6890.12 - 6893.92] depth in other ways and other different
[6891.60 - 6896.28] illnesses and everything else including
[6893.92 - 6897.56] with what we're talking about here again
[6896.28 - 6899.32] I'm honored you're here I'm honored
[6897.56 - 6901.60] you're with me today you know when I was
[6899.32 - 6903.88] given the gift it wasn't for me when I
[6901.60 - 6906.16] when I was young when I was a child when
[6903.88 - 6909.08] it was given to me it was for you guys
[6906.16 - 6911.28] and I knew that then and uh and I know
[6909.08 - 6913.76] it now and so anything I can do
[6911.28 - 6916.40] providing any bit of piece of
[6913.76 - 6919.84] information that could help you in any
[6916.40 - 6924.08] way that's what I'm here for blessings I
