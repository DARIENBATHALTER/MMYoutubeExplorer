[0.36 - 4.00] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[2.28 - 6.24] listening to the medical medium radio
[4.00 - 8.88] show each week I talk about the most
[6.24 - 10.64] advanced healing information and secrets
[8.88 - 13.04] about health much of which is not found
[10.64 - 14.80] anywhere else and is decades ahead of
[13.04 - 17.64] what's out there now and we're going to
[14.80 - 19.88] be covering some of those today this is
[17.64 - 21.88] a big deal I love this show what we're
[19.88 - 24.76] talking about as I've always said who
[21.88 - 28.76] has 10 or 20 30 years to wait blah blah
[24.76 - 31.12] blah right the 10 20 30 years to wait it
[28.76 - 34.00] does matter someone said again to me
[31.12 - 35.52] recently you always say that they said
[34.00 - 39.80] they said you know Anthony you always
[35.52 - 41.68] say that 10 20 heard it over and over
[39.80 - 43.72] and I and you know let me tell you
[41.68 - 47.16] something and then someone else said to
[43.72 - 50.16] me that it means everything to know that
[47.16 - 52.08] I understand someone's pain and
[50.16 - 55.64] suffering and chronic illness that's
[52.08 - 58.16] lasted so long I said to this other
[55.64 - 60.72] person who who was being kind of
[58.16 - 62.88] negative about that and I said said look
[60.72 - 65.24] did you ever have anything go wrong at
[62.88 - 67.76] all did you ever have a problem oh you
[65.24 - 69.68] know I once Twisted an ankle and you
[67.76 - 73.08] know it took a couple of weeks to heal I
[69.68 - 75.40] go what about if that ankle took 6
[73.08 - 77.44] months to heal but more than that you
[75.40 - 79.32] couldn't walk around or get around what
[77.44 - 81.28] do you like to do they said well I like
[79.32 - 83.00] to play basketball and you know I like
[81.28 - 85.32] with my friends and I like to do this

[89.60 - 93.64] be saying and you know and he said

[93.64 - 97.92] this the wrong way who does have six
[95.92 - 101.00] months or a year I go well think about
[97.92 - 104.56] the people who've had chronic fatigue
[101.00 - 106.56] for 10 years on and off and or a
[104.56 - 109.40] migraine or chronic

[470.52 - 475.16] cold and
[471.72 - 478.88] flu cold and flu that's what we're doing
[475.16 - 483.24] today so germs germs and germs how do we
[478.88 - 485.44] first of of all not catch the flu how do
[483.24 - 487.76] we not catch it there's ways of
[485.44 - 491.32] protecting ourselves I think I told you
[487.76 - 492.32] this one story before where I was you
[491.32 - 496.36] know I was
[492.32 - 499.28] traveling and I was rundown and I was
[496.36 - 500.72] traveling and uh I I think it's about
[499.28 - 503.20] five or six years ago don't know what it
[500.72 - 505.52] is now I can't remember now but you know
[503.20 - 507.88] and and a lot was going on and there was
[505.52 - 510.28] a flu ripping through everybody had it
[507.88 - 513.16] they all had the sinuses the cough they
[510.28 - 518.36] all had the fevers everybody was getting
[513.16 - 521.52] it had it and I remember I felt a little
[518.36 - 523.80] tickle in my throat and I said oh man
[521.52 - 525.92] this is this is just not this is not
[523.80 - 528.80] good I don't need this right now I'm
[525.92 - 530.40] doing so much somebody must have coughed
[528.80 - 533.88] in my
[530.40 - 536.68] face someone someone must have you know
[533.88 - 539.20] or whatever and I felt that tickle in my
[536.68 - 541.52] throat and spirit said the zinc the Li
[539.20 - 544.88] liquid zinc sulfate the liquid zinc
[541.52 - 546.76] sulfate and I did zinc shock therapy
[544.88 - 548.32] that's what I did well hey it sounds
[546.76 - 550.28] like it's something out there no no it's
[548.32 - 553.16] something that I created meaning through
[550.28 - 554.60] spirit that Spirit helped me create it's
[553.16 - 556.48] not something you look up and you look
[554.60 - 558.40] up Zing shock therapy and if it is out
[556.48 - 561.32] there now that's because of me for sure
[558.40 - 562.64] okay but the point is is because it
[561.32 - 564.28] sounds like something that's already
[562.64 - 566.52] been going around and it's out it's out
[564.28 - 568.56] it's been out forever no it's not and
[566.52 - 569.96] what happened is spirit said zinc zinc
[568.56 - 572.08] shock therapy
[569.96 - 575.40] I said okay what do I do Spirit what do
[572.08 - 577.44] I do and I just shot a whole bunch of
[575.40 - 580.68] dropper FS right in the throat
[577.44 - 582.04] immediately cuz I knew I knew I was
[580.68 - 584.72] coming down with that
[582.04 - 586.24] flu and I just boom boom and I wasn't
[584.72 - 588.36] sleeping cuz I was traveling a lot I
[586.24 - 589.80] wasn't sleeping I was catching an hour
[588.36 - 591.08] here catching an hour there was so much
[589.80 - 593.28] going on it was the height of the flu
[591.08 - 594.92] season and I just squirted it on down
[593.28 - 596.56] there one squirt two squirt three squirt
[594.92 - 600.00] four squirt right in the throat let it
[596.56 - 602.04] sit there 2 hours later 1 2 3 4 squirts
[600.00 - 606.28] let it sit in there couple hours later 1
[602.04 - 609.64] 2 3 4 let it sit in there bam woke up
[606.28 - 613.12] that morning the next morning gone gone
[609.64 - 616.36] gone gone never even touched me I got it
[613.12 - 618.60] early I got it early and if we can't get
[616.36 - 620.96] it early we can't get it early that's
[618.60 - 623.28] okay too we could do lots and lots of
[620.96 - 624.44] things to protect ourselves from the flu
[623.28 - 625.80] and we're going to cover all kinds of
[624.44 - 628.04] information about the flu and everything
[625.80 - 633.04] so you know today's going to be really
[628.04 - 634.80] fun but so the deal is the deal is how
[633.04 - 636.48] do we not catch it to begin with well
[634.80 - 638.12] you know we got to try not to get rund
[636.48 - 640.64] down we got to try to get some sleep
[638.12 - 646.00] okay fine you know those are the
[640.64 - 649.12] basics but the flu virus likes to eat it
[646.00 - 654.44] likes to eat like other viruses viruses
[649.12 - 656.28] love to eat now um you know there there
[654.44 - 658.28] are people out there professionals out
[656.28 - 659.60] there in the medical world that don't
[658.28 - 663.56] know yet
[659.60 - 665.40] that viruses feed that they consume they
[663.56 - 668.56] believe that no these cells reproduce
[665.40 - 670.08] they reproduce through a protein and and
[668.56 - 672.76] um that's all they do they don't they
[670.08 - 674.84] don't eat anything and so this is this
[672.76 - 678.20] is information that's out there as far
[674.84 - 679.48] as viruses don't eat anything that's
[678.20 - 683.24] wrong and
[679.48 - 685.24] misinformation viruses feed they eat
[683.24 - 687.08] that's what they do they love certain
[685.24 - 688.76] things like for instance I always talk
[687.08 - 692.08] about the epscene bar virus I'm the
[688.76 - 694.16] first one to bring into the world what
[692.08 - 696.40] Epstein bar what symptoms Epstein bar
[694.16 - 698.12] causes I'm the first person to do that
[696.40 - 700.08] now it's being taken and the
[698.12 - 702.08] information's just being scrambled it's
[700.08 - 703.72] running around a muck out there uh
[702.08 - 705.16] people aren't giving me credit about it
[703.72 - 707.00] and they're just trying to rewrite it
[705.16 - 708.88] and it's but it's not you know 100%
[707.00 - 710.48] accurate and I always say try to go to
[708.88 - 712.36] the main source the main source is
[710.48 - 714.24] Spirit that's the main source so when it
[712.36 - 716.44] comes down EP bar and stuff always come
[714.24 - 718.36] back to Spirits information um the
[716.44 - 719.76] thyroid book covers a lot of that that
[718.36 - 722.28] I've never even covered in the first
[719.76 - 725.92] book medical medium but anyway
[722.28 - 729.00] viruses viruses feed and they're
[725.92 - 733.40] hungry they multiply through food
[729.00 - 737.08] sources that's what they do food can
[733.40 - 740.40] enter into a virus so viruses have a
[737.08 - 742.36] door a doorway that opens and shuts and
[740.40 - 743.40] food enters into the virus that's how it
[742.36 - 746.44] grows and
[743.40 - 748.20] reproduces this is will be discovered it
[746.44 - 750.24] will be and there's lots of things that
[748.20 - 753.36] are discovered now that I knew 30 years
[750.24 - 756.88] ago this one will be eventually but the
[753.36 - 758.96] flu virus loves food now if you talk
[756.88 - 762.56] about the Aven flu if you talk about the
[758.96 - 765.92] bird flu bird flu the reason why the
[762.56 - 768.32] birds catch a flu is the virus loves to
[765.92 - 771.04] attack it has the ability to attack a
[768.32 - 774.24] bird it has the ability to feed off of a
[771.04 - 777.16] bird what's the bird of choice that flu
[774.24 - 780.44] viruses love to feed off of the bird
[777.16 - 784.00] choice is chicken chicken chickens okay
[780.44 - 788.72] fowl chicken that's what bird flu likes
[784.00 - 792.80] to actually eat and feed off of and bird
[788.72 - 795.48] flu is a dangerous one because it causes
[792.80 - 799.72] flesh deterioration because it feeds off
[795.48 - 802.80] of Flesh internally inside the bird so
[799.72 - 805.76] that flu bug feeds off the adrenal
[802.80 - 809.60] glands inside of a bird meaning it eats
[805.76 - 813.80] adrenal gland and it eats eats flesh so
[809.60 - 816.88] it actually feeds off of um cells cells
[813.80 - 820.68] in the body flesh cells in the body of a
[816.88 - 824.20] bird so that's the kind of virus it is
[820.68 - 826.52] but all flu viruses like to eat chicken
[824.20 - 828.44] now I'm not trying to scare the crap out
[826.52 - 830.80] of everybody purposely to get them to
[828.44 - 832.92] stop eating chicken you like chicken and
[830.80 - 834.44] that's what does you right you feel and
[832.92 - 836.00] you're eating still your leafy greens
[834.44 - 837.52] and you're still bringing some fruits in
[836.00 - 838.80] that I want you to bring then hey if
[837.52 - 842.92] that's what you want to do that's what
[838.80 - 846.24] you want to do you know I I'm not anti
[842.92 - 848.84] every single diet but I will say if you
[846.24 - 851.88] want the least chance of catching a flu
[848.84 - 854.00] or stomach flu especially that darn
[851.88 - 856.92] stomach flu where you vomit and you're
[854.00 - 858.44] sick and your stomach's a hot mess if
[856.92 - 861.40] you want to get rid of all the you know
[858.44 - 863.04] the different stomach flu then you don't
[861.40 - 864.64] want to have chicken in your system and
[863.04 - 868.52] I don't mean chicken that day or chicken
[864.64 - 870.64] that night I mean Chicken in general now
[868.52 - 872.12] what what you're thinking right now
[870.64 - 874.52] maybe not all of you but what you're
[872.12 - 876.88] probably thinking is hey wait a minute
[874.52 - 878.96] what about chicken soup isn't that the
[876.88 - 882.00] best cure for the flu no it's not the
[878.96 - 884.44] best cure for the flu it's not it never
[882.00 - 886.48] was a cure for the flu now I know I'm
[884.44 - 888.08] controversial on this for a minute here
[886.48 - 890.24] because I know there's a whole bunch of
[888.08 - 891.68] chicken soup stuff going on out there
[890.24 - 893.92] and there's all these people trying to
[891.68 - 895.64] prove it and it's always it's been you
[893.92 - 897.92] know it's been looked at and it's
[895.64 - 900.56] folklore and it goes it's everything
[897.92 - 903.32] from science to folkl or whatever but no
[900.56 - 906.24] chicken soup is not what makes somebody
[903.32 - 909.52] start getting better or feeling a little
[906.24 - 913.72] better okay it's the it's whatever else
[909.52 - 916.24] is in that chicken soup it's the garlic
[913.72 - 918.84] it's the onions everybody does a chicken
[916.24 - 920.76] soup differently they have the garlic in
[918.84 - 922.84] there they have the onions in there they
[920.76 - 926.52] have the carrots in there they have the
[922.84 - 927.96] celery in there they have they have um
[926.52 - 929.32] I've seen people put zucchini in their
[927.96 - 931.00] chicken soup
[929.32 - 933.44] you know old recipes just just chopping
[931.00 - 934.68] up zucchini it goes in there I've seen
[933.44 - 936.76] lots of different things in chicken
[934.68 - 940.00] soups every Grandma has a different
[936.76 - 942.32] chicken soup they're not all the same
[940.00 - 945.44] but it's what's in that chicken soup
[942.32 - 948.12] namely garlic namely an onion especially
[945.44 - 949.96] an onion believe it or not that actually
[948.12 - 952.72] helps improve and then it's the
[949.96 - 955.72] hydration of the chicken soup and it's
[952.72 - 957.84] the mineral salts in the chicken soup
[955.72 - 959.16] the mineral salt there's nothing in the
[957.84 - 961.40] chicken that help helps you with a
[959.16 - 963.16] colder flu that's the part that's
[961.40 - 965.32] fighting against you when you're using
[963.16 - 967.52] chicken soup for a flu or a cold I'm not
[965.32 - 969.72] trying to be negative about chicken soup
[967.52 - 972.00] not I'm just trying to look if I don't
[969.72 - 975.00] give it to you straight then I'm doing
[972.00 - 977.08] you wrong bottom line I'm doing you're
[975.00 - 978.64] wrong so if you're if you get upset
[977.08 - 980.12] about me and you think I'm like might be
[978.64 - 981.64] biased about chicken soup or anything
[980.12 - 982.88] like that because people are really
[981.64 - 984.84] their head strong about their chicken
[982.88 - 987.84] soup like that's one area I was afraid
[984.84 - 989.56] of even kind of jumping into today I
[987.84 - 991.04] remember for the show I I Was preparing
[989.56 - 993.48] a little bit I was talking to my
[991.04 - 996.12] assistant and I said I'm afraid to talk
[993.48 - 999.52] about the chicken soup I'm
[996.12 - 1001.08] afraid I'm afraid but then you know I
[999.52 - 1002.40] thought about it and then spirit said to
[1001.08 - 1004.36] me spirit said what are you going to do
[1002.40 - 1005.64] you going to do the people wrong I said
[1004.36 - 1006.88] what do you mean spirit said well you
[1005.64 - 1009.52] just don't be straight with them you're
[1006.88 - 1012.32] going to do them wrong I go oh man so
[1009.52 - 1013.96] here's the deal here's the deal what
[1012.32 - 1015.48] happens is with that chicken soup you
[1013.96 - 1018.12] got all the mineral salts in there from
[1015.48 - 1019.28] the celery you got that you got the
[1018.12 - 1021.72] carrots there's mineral salts and
[1019.28 - 1024.08] carrots and there's also precious sugars
[1021.72 - 1025.68] that feed your liver and feed your body
[1024.08 - 1028.72] and feed your body's immune system to
[1025.68 - 1031.36] fight the flu and then the onion the
[1028.72 - 1036.20] onion is antiviral
[1031.36 - 1038.80] antiviral garlic antiviral the flu is a
[1036.20 - 1040.88] virus that's what makes chicken soup
[1038.80 - 1042.04] chicken soup so what I like is I like
[1040.88 - 1045.48] taking out the chicken because that
[1042.04 - 1047.52] feeds the virus that feeds the flu virus
[1045.48 - 1049.48] especially the flu virus out of all the
[1047.52 - 1052.48] viruses especially the flu virus the
[1049.48 - 1055.56] chicken is literally its number one food
[1052.48 - 1057.32] number one food and people who eat
[1055.56 - 1058.76] chicken on a daily basis every day when
[1057.32 - 1060.56] the flu season comes around they get the
[1058.76 - 1062.32] flu and they may get it twice three
[1060.56 - 1063.68] times unless they take care of
[1062.32 - 1064.96] themselves in other ways while they're
[1063.68 - 1066.20] still eating the chicken unless they're
[1064.96 - 1067.88] taking care of themselves so the person
[1066.20 - 1069.00] who goes I never caught a flu and I eat
[1067.88 - 1070.12] chicken every day it's cuz you're
[1069.00 - 1072.44] probably doing other things for your
[1070.12 - 1073.80] health and you're keeping yourself
[1072.44 - 1075.48] steady with all these different ways so
[1073.80 - 1077.08] when you do catch that colder flu it's
[1075.48 - 1078.44] mild or you don't remember you had one
[1077.08 - 1080.40] cuz it was 2 years ago and it was mild
[1078.44 - 1081.20] mild there's a lot of people that got
[1080.40 - 1084.20] get
[1081.20 - 1085.76] slammed three four times a year with a
[1084.20 - 1086.64] cold or flu or sinus infection or
[1085.76 - 1088.96] stomach
[1086.64 - 1092.56] flu and you want that chicken out of
[1088.96 - 1094.16] there just telling you right now you
[1092.56 - 1097.12] want it out of there you want the
[1094.16 - 1098.48] healing broths I like the healing broth
[1097.12 - 1099.84] reason why the healing broth doesn't
[1098.48 - 1101.76] have chicken in it because I don't want
[1099.84 - 1104.44] it to be a chicken soup because I know
[1101.76 - 1107.84] that viruses will the viruses that are
[1104.44 - 1110.64] chicken wanting will want it chicken
[1107.84 - 1112.60] hungry will want it so so that's why the
[1110.64 - 1114.20] healing broth is what it is because it
[1112.60 - 1116.16] really is a healing broth when you
[1114.20 - 1119.36] remove the viral
[1116.16 - 1121.68] feeder really important to know so you
[1119.36 - 1123.52] can still make your your still make your
[1121.68 - 1126.76] chicken soup without the chicken and
[1123.52 - 1128.84] still get better results with cold flu
[1126.76 - 1130.92] you know sinus infections a whole bit in
[1128.84 - 1132.40] fact why don't you put more onion in it
[1130.92 - 1135.40] in fact why don't you put more garlic in
[1132.40 - 1140.00] it and make it a real healing healing
[1135.40 - 1143.12] soup a a savior a graceful savior soup
[1140.00 - 1145.24] why don't you really do that and remove
[1143.12 - 1146.80] that chicken fat chicken fat takes
[1145.24 - 1149.28] oxygen out of the blood so you can't
[1146.80 - 1151.60] fight the virus even faster so it even
[1149.28 - 1154.44] the fat from the chicken on top of that
[1151.60 - 1156.60] chicken sou make a big big pot of
[1154.44 - 1158.40] chicken soup stick it in the
[1156.60 - 1161.16] refrigerator and the next morning you
[1158.40 - 1165.00] come to it and you got a half inch of
[1161.16 - 1168.64] fat on top of that Frozen not frozen but
[1165.00 - 1172.04] solidified gated right there on top
[1168.64 - 1174.28] right there on top that fat right there
[1172.04 - 1175.80] slows down your liver makes it sluggish
[1174.28 - 1177.68] that fat right there stops your immune
[1175.80 - 1178.96] system from beating down epine bar it
[1177.68 - 1181.52] stops your immune system from beating
[1178.96 - 1183.12] down a flu virus right there stops your
[1181.52 - 1185.04] immune system from from beating down
[1183.12 - 1188.12] bacteria like strep aaka strep Ackle to
[1185.04 - 1190.08] strep throat it stops that a big fat
[1188.12 - 1191.88] layer of fat stops oxygen to your immune
[1190.08 - 1193.44] system oxygen to your liver oxygen to
[1191.88 - 1195.52] your heart you don't want that on your
[1193.44 - 1199.08] soup while you're trying to heal you
[1195.52 - 1201.24] don't want that there okay this is
[1199.08 - 1203.32] important really important to know wh
[1201.24 - 1206.76] watch the flak I get from this show I
[1203.32 - 1210.68] can already feel it coming on but look
[1206.76 - 1213.40] look look I'm just saying if you want to
[1210.68 - 1215.52] be flu free or fight it faster if you
[1213.40 - 1217.20] don't want to be bog down these are some
[1215.52 - 1219.96] tips that are so
[1217.20 - 1223.28] important so let's go into some more fun
[1219.96 - 1227.28] stuff about all this colds there there
[1223.28 - 1229.52] are no colds anymore colds rhinovirus
[1227.28 - 1231.84] there are none they've all been
[1229.52 - 1234.08] dominated they've all been taken over

[1234.08 - 1237.40] going to hear it here another piece of
[1235.48 - 1239.36] information you're only going to hear
[1237.40 - 1240.68] here sound like a broken record that
[1239.36 - 1241.96] record with that I half to though
[1240.68 - 1243.36] because if there's anybody new that's
[1241.96 - 1244.88] listening to the show for the first time
[1243.36 - 1246.88] they need to know I'm not just taking
[1244.88 - 1248.32] some information off the internet and
[1246.88 - 1250.96] delivering it to you like everybody else
[1248.32 - 1252.92] is but no I need you here to learn so
[1250.96 - 1255.04] you can help people I need you to know
[1252.92 - 1258.64] all these things so here's the deal

[1266.96 - 1271.04] that information's out there there's so
[1268.76 - 1273.64] many different strains of the flu but

[1282.92 - 1286.56] fall when everybody goes back to college
[1285.28 - 1288.92] and everybody's got the flu and they're
[1286.56 - 1292.12] coughing their butts off that's not not

[1306.92 - 1311.92] summertime bull they all catch colds and
[1310.28 - 1314.44] flu in the summertime been helping
[1311.92 - 1318.04] people for over 30 years I can't tell

[1328.64 - 1332.28] um chest flues bronchitis in the middle
[1330.56 - 1334.96] of the summer going all the way to
[1332.28 - 1336.80] August there's always an August flu
[1334.96 - 1338.84] before you even get to late September
[1336.80 - 1342.24] when everybody goes back to
[1338.84 - 1346.20] school the flu never stops because it's
[1342.24 - 1348.52] happening all across the country all
[1346.20 - 1352.32] across the globe
[1348.52 - 1355.80] when it's winter in Australia the flu's
[1352.32 - 1357.72] ramp it you see and it's everybody's
[1355.80 - 1360.44] hopping on planes and bringing it to the
[1357.72 - 1362.32] US it doesn't matter where it is and in
[1360.44 - 1364.68] the summertime in summertime in
[1362.32 - 1366.80] Australia I'm just using Australia's
[1364.68 - 1370.04] example everybody's bringing it over
[1366.80 - 1374.28] there in the planes from our winter it
[1370.04 - 1377.12] doesn't matter the flu is 247 it's all
[1374.28 - 1379.44] year long everybody's catching it
[1377.12 - 1381.44] different times of the season it doesn't
[1379.44 - 1383.80] matter and it's always there and colds
[1381.44 - 1385.88] have died they have been taking over see
[1383.80 - 1388.36] cold bugs the little cold bugs that used
[1385.88 - 1391.64] to be the bugs of the colds little tiny
[1388.36 - 1394.96] sore throat some sniffles goes away in a
[1391.64 - 1398.12] day um if you're lucky a temperature of
[1394.96 - 1399.76] 99 those are the past now if you do have
[1398.12 - 1402.40] symptoms like that you could easily have
[1399.76 - 1405.00] one of the mild flu or your body's
[1402.40 - 1406.84] fighting that flu fantastically so it
[1405.00 - 1408.72] doesn't turn into what feels like a flu
[1406.84 - 1410.08] so you feel like you just had a cold so
[1408.72 - 1413.16] if you're at work and someone's like oh
[1410.08 - 1416.00] I just dealing with a cold I got sinuses
[1413.16 - 1419.08] got a little thing no it's the flu it's
[1416.00 - 1420.64] the flu bottom line and how you may
[1419.08 - 1422.56] react to that flu is different than how
[1420.64 - 1424.32] the other person reacts too everybody
[1422.56 - 1427.08] reacts differently some people get a
[1424.32 - 1428.36] pipe and fever of 104 pipe and fever of
[1427.08 - 1431.12] 102 they're
[1428.36 - 1434.04] Delirious some people they just just run
[1431.12 - 1438.72] a temperature of 100 they go to
[1434.04 - 1442.08] work they go out and Bowl after work
[1438.72 - 1444.24] and um and that's what happens and you
[1442.08 - 1447.24] know it's it's it's it's not so not so
[1444.24 - 1451.00] heavy duty it's kind of mild here's the
[1447.24 - 1454.68] deal the flu always creates all this
[1451.00 - 1457.40] mucus in many cases and what happens is
[1454.68 - 1461.00] when it creates mucus like that so when
[1457.40 - 1463.00] the mucus starts and starts to drain it
[1461.00 - 1464.88] drains at night it drains you know the
[1463.00 - 1467.04] whole postnasal trip but even more than
[1464.88 - 1468.60] that drains into the chest you may not
[1467.04 - 1471.60] feel it you may not have a cough at
[1468.60 - 1473.16] first when you start with a flu and you
[1471.60 - 1475.12] different levels of flues different mild
[1473.16 - 1477.24] ones whatever but whether mild to
[1475.12 - 1479.08] extreme and then the mucus builds up in
[1477.24 - 1480.92] the lungs 3 days later you start to
[1479.08 - 1483.20] cough or the mucus starts breaking up or
[1480.92 - 1485.56] really starts in the sinus is heavier
[1483.20 - 1489.04] and heavier then drains back down in the
[1485.56 - 1490.96] chest that mucus in the chest that's
[1489.04 - 1494.88] where bronchitis that's what bronchitis
[1490.96 - 1496.52] is bronchitis is that mucus down in the
[1494.88 - 1501.04] chest
[1496.52 - 1504.16] pneumonia is is when bacteria starts to
[1501.04 - 1507.20] proliferate starts to grow from that
[1504.16 - 1508.40] mucus being down there too long so you
[1507.20 - 1510.72] get you become
[1508.40 - 1513.32] pneumatic so you know because people
[1510.72 - 1514.52] have the pneumonia bacteria they have it
[1513.32 - 1516.12] they both have different varieties of
[1514.52 - 1517.44] pneumonia bacteria all in them they have
[1516.12 - 1519.64] chamian pneumonia they have all
[1517.44 - 1522.36] different kinds of pneumonia that's
[1519.64 - 1525.76] inside of them so you have to you have
[1522.36 - 1528.92] to understand how that works um so
[1525.76 - 1531.20] that's in US automatically that bacteria
[1528.92 - 1532.68] and that bacteria really is worthless it
[1531.20 - 1534.76] doesn't cause any trouble unless you're
[1532.68 - 1538.40] really beaten down run down eating
[1534.76 - 1539.88] terribly wrong um catching cold and flu
[1538.40 - 1543.12] and not even catching cold and flu if
[1539.88 - 1545.36] you're just beaten down and run down not
[1543.12 - 1548.64] taking care of yourself and you're
[1545.36 - 1550.92] severely zinc deficient yeah you know
[1548.64 - 1553.08] you can you can get that bacteria can
[1550.92 - 1555.52] really you know start up you can get a
[1553.08 - 1557.32] strep strep strep bacteria in the lungs
[1555.52 - 1559.44] causing uh pneumonia too a strep
[1557.32 - 1561.36] pneumonia IA you can get you know a
[1559.44 - 1564.12] Pneumatic bacteria basically what that
[1561.36 - 1566.56] means it's a bacteria that that's kind
[1564.12 - 1568.20] of slightly unidentified to some degree
[1566.56 - 1569.80] it's just they that's what they call it
[1568.20 - 1571.56] pneumonia basically they don't know what
[1569.80 - 1573.20] it is there's a couple of varieties of
[1571.56 - 1576.56] pneumatic
[1573.20 - 1578.48] bacteria and um you know really believe
[1576.56 - 1581.20] it or not the strep has a lot to do with
[1578.48 - 1583.76] a different varieties causing causing
[1581.20 - 1586.36] that but the whole point is you got the
[1583.76 - 1589.52] flu it's draining
[1586.36 - 1592.84] down and it gets down to the
[1589.52 - 1594.20] lung and then it sits in there the mucus
[1592.84 - 1596.64] and then you got the cough and you got
[1594.20 - 1598.52] the bronchitis so if you're not you know
[1596.64 - 1600.96] doing expectance and taking care of
[1598.52 - 1602.88] yourself and taking it easy you know
[1600.96 - 1604.88] that that mucus you get the coughing
[1602.88 - 1606.96] attacks in the morning coughing teexs at
[1604.88 - 1609.20] night and you really can't you can't
[1606.96 - 1612.00] function good and then what happens is
[1609.20 - 1614.64] if the mucus is down there way too long
[1612.00 - 1616.40] you can get the pneumonia possibilities
[1614.64 - 1618.04] which is bacteria can get built up down
[1616.40 - 1621.56] here whether it's a strep that you've
[1618.04 - 1623.92] had in your system for years or um you
[1621.56 - 1625.72] know a type of pneumatic bacteria that
[1623.92 - 1628.32] you've happened to have in your system
[1625.72 - 1631.04] like a caldia bacteria anything like
[1628.32 - 1632.32] that yeah and and it could be down in
[1631.04 - 1634.04] there and start creating some kind of
[1632.32 - 1636.12] pneumonia if you're really run down if
[1634.04 - 1638.72] your zinc reserves are low you're not
[1636.12 - 1641.96] taking care of yourself it can go into
[1638.72 - 1643.28] something like that but the mucus a lot
[1641.96 - 1644.92] of people when they first come down with
[1643.28 - 1647.20] their flu they're usually say they go to
[1644.92 - 1649.00] work and they're not feeling that great
[1647.20 - 1650.60] they get the sore throat and they're
[1649.00 - 1652.96] like no no I just got a sore throat
[1650.60 - 1654.60] everything's all good but then you know
[1652.96 - 1655.92] that night comes sore throat gets a
[1654.60 - 1658.36] little worse they get a fever in the
[1655.92 - 1661.52] morning like okay they go back to work
[1658.36 - 1664.16] again and now you know the the the
[1661.52 - 1666.24] sinuses start to clog up and the mucus
[1664.16 - 1667.44] starts to form a little later on it's
[1666.24 - 1668.84] almost predictable you said well you're
[1667.44 - 1670.72] going to have a cough in four days
[1668.84 - 1672.84] you're going to have a cough in 3 days
[1670.72 - 1674.40] you're going to have a cough in 5 days
[1672.84 - 1676.56] they're like no no no no I'm not going
[1674.40 - 1678.00] to have a cough how could I have a cough
[1676.56 - 1680.00] I only have a sore throat I got a little
[1678.00 - 1681.96] mild fever no you're going to have a
[1680.00 - 1684.52] cough and then yeah four or 5 days later
[1681.96 - 1685.96] person's coughing their brains out
[1684.52 - 1689.68] because you know the flu is just running
[1685.96 - 1691.44] the course but here's how it works it's
[1689.68 - 1693.12] like an every six week cycle I was
[1691.44 - 1695.48] talking about before there's a new flu
[1693.12 - 1697.72] in the Horizon new flu in the Horizon
[1695.48 - 1700.20] I've seen people catch him every 3
[1697.72 - 1702.16] months I've seen people catch him every
[1700.20 - 1703.84] six weeks I've seen people run down
[1702.16 - 1706.36] where they catch them in all different
[1703.84 - 1709.48] ways but there's a lot of different flu
[1706.36 - 1712.76] they take different shapes different
[1709.48 - 1715.64] sizes flues come in different varieties
[1712.76 - 1719.72] some flu like to create more high fevers
[1715.64 - 1722.48] some like to be sinus related only only
[1719.72 - 1724.68] and some like to be stomach related some
[1722.48 - 1727.16] like to be across between sinus and
[1724.68 - 1729.48] stomach a lot of people get so much
[1727.16 - 1732.16] mucus that they think they got a stomach
[1729.48 - 1734.16] flu but it was really just all sinus
[1732.16 - 1737.20] because the amount of mucus that they
[1734.16 - 1739.76] swallowed lots of swallowing mucus down
[1737.20 - 1742.28] in in the stomach letting it sit down in
[1739.76 - 1745.88] there and then the stomach gets sick it
[1742.28 - 1747.28] gets bloated as heck and no appetite
[1745.88 - 1748.92] sometimes you might vomit mucus there's
[1747.28 - 1751.08] a lot of people that cough and vomit
[1748.92 - 1752.80] mucus when they got the flu because
[1751.08 - 1754.60] their stomachs are filled with mucus
[1752.80 - 1757.04] their lungs have it and they're just
[1754.60 - 1758.72] coughing it out so these are all the
[1757.04 - 1763.40] things hey maybe you you've been in this
[1758.72 - 1768.04] position maybe you know someone but um
[1763.40 - 1770.12] so knocking colds and flu out early is a
[1768.04 - 1772.80] big deal so we're going to cover that I
[1770.12 - 1775.96] talked about the zinc always have a
[1772.80 - 1779.40] bottle of liquid sulfate zinc with you
[1775.96 - 1781.16] nearby in your life just always have it
[1779.40 - 1784.24] because if you think you're even
[1781.16 - 1786.84] remotely getting the possibility of a of
[1784.24 - 1788.96] a flu you want to shoot that zinc in
[1786.84 - 1790.80] your throat and let it sit there if
[1788.96 - 1791.60] you're zinc sensitive where you're just
[1790.80 - 1794.48] too
[1791.60 - 1795.84] sensitive just do a few tiny drops some
[1794.48 - 1797.60] people that can't they're really
[1795.84 - 1799.16] sensitive to certain vitamins and zinc
[1797.60 - 1802.60] can be you know a sensitive thing to
[1799.16 - 1804.72] some people um how do how else do we
[1802.60 - 1807.64] prevent a flu keep your fingers and your
[1804.72 - 1809.92] face keep your fingers in your hands
[1807.64 - 1812.56] away from your face keep your fingers
[1809.92 - 1814.16] and your hands away from your eyes you
[1812.56 - 1815.92] know if it's flu season you're working
[1814.16 - 1818.40] on keyboards and you're working and
[1815.92 - 1819.80] you're doing this and wherever you are
[1818.40 - 1821.96] or you're touching somebody that's got
[1819.80 - 1824.72] the flu whatever you got to do just
[1821.96 - 1827.84] don't take your hands and put your
[1824.72 - 1830.00] fingers in your eyes don't rub your eyes
[1827.84 - 1833.20] because it's an instant flu it's a
[1830.00 - 1834.64] guaranteed catch I mean practically
[1833.20 - 1836.80] guaranteed when you're out and about
[1834.64 - 1838.72] going to restaurants whatever you know
[1836.80 - 1841.68] take handy wipes with you during flu
[1838.72 - 1843.08] season use a handy wipe before you start
[1841.68 - 1846.92] your dinner at a
[1843.08 - 1850.80] restaurant order your food hot order
[1846.92 - 1852.68] your food hot at the restaurants so that
[1850.80 - 1854.20] the person making it because during flu
[1852.68 - 1856.08] season they're coughing they're sneezing
[1854.20 - 1858.20] coughing all over your food sneezing all
[1856.08 - 1861.12] over your food the weight is sneezing on
[1858.20 - 1863.60] your food coughing on your
[1861.12 - 1865.92] food and it goes on and on and on the
[1863.60 - 1867.80] beat goes on and and you want to make
[1865.92 - 1870.20] sure your food comes really hot so it
[1867.80 - 1872.28] just basically kills the flu viruses
[1870.20 - 1873.40] these little things matter every bit of
[1872.28 - 1874.96] it so you want you know want to make
[1873.40 - 1876.76] sure you got cooked food and you don't
[1874.96 - 1878.24] want to be doing the raw salads and and
[1876.76 - 1882.28] when you're in the middle of flu season
[1878.24 - 1884.60] in restaurants and you want to make sure
[1882.28 - 1886.76] that your food is piping hot you know
[1884.60 - 1888.44] say hey look can you can you make the
[1886.76 - 1890.16] plate hot can you make the food you know
[1888.44 - 1892.68] can you just throw the food in the oven
[1890.16 - 1895.56] get it nice and hot whatever it is it
[1892.68 - 1898.12] all matters so see these are some of the
[1895.56 - 1902.44] things to think about so let's go back
[1898.12 - 1906.40] to um what foods feed the
[1902.44 - 1911.72] flu what foods feed all viruses dairy
[1906.40 - 1913.68] products that's a big feeder of viruses
[1911.72 - 1915.12] I talk about it in the books you know
[1913.68 - 1916.80] and I talk about it in different ways
[1915.12 - 1918.88] like the first book I mentioned it
[1916.80 - 1921.44] Medical medium and then I provided more
[1918.88 - 1925.56] information in the second book but it's
[1921.44 - 1928.84] important to know that what you're
[1925.56 - 1931.64] eating can feed something else that's a
[1928.84 - 1934.84] way that's a real true way of protecting
[1931.64 - 1936.60] yourself right there it's it's really
[1934.84 - 1938.56] imperative to know that and you might
[1936.60 - 1941.56] say well I mean I feel fine once I've
[1938.56 - 1943.56] eaten that piece of cheese I feel okay I
[1941.56 - 1945.20] can eat cheese you know every day I
[1943.56 - 1949.08] could have it on my salads I could have
[1945.20 - 1951.04] it on my sandwiches but it is a recipe
[1949.08 - 1953.12] for feeding something eventually whether
[1951.04 - 1955.80] it's an Epstein bar whether it's cytoma
[1953.12 - 1959.60] virus whether it's hhv6 whether it's
[1955.80 - 1962.36] simplex one Simplex 2 whether it's you
[1959.60 - 1965.28] know um something else it can feed it
[1962.36 - 1968.36] including bacteria it can feed it eoli
[1965.28 - 1970.24] loves eoli itself loves it merca loves
[1968.36 - 1972.12] it loves dairy products just so many
[1970.24 - 1974.08] things love it and if you're big into
[1972.12 - 1976.76] parasites if you're someone who just you
[1974.08 - 1977.68] know is is a parasite freak meaning like
[1976.76 - 1979.20] you know you know there's people out
[1977.68 - 1980.40] there that just everything's parasites
[1979.20 - 1983.64] everything's parasites everything's
[1980.40 - 1987.04] parasites it it then don't feed the
[1983.64 - 1990.28] parasites cuz guess what parasites eat
[1987.04 - 1992.56] they eat and worms eat dairy products
[1990.28 - 1995.20] that's what they love milk cheese butter
[1992.56 - 1998.36] milk cheese butter kefir yogurt ghee
[1995.20 - 2000.32] yeah even ghee believe it or not so
[1998.36 - 2002.00] always know this so cold flu season
[2000.32 - 2003.76] don't eat any dairy products you have a
[2002.00 - 2007.60] better chance of not catching cold not
[2003.76 - 2011.28] catching a flu and if you catch the
[2007.60 - 2013.36] flu okay it could be much more mild less
[2011.28 - 2015.40] mucus I've seen people who catch the flu
[2013.36 - 2016.84] every single year I mean out of the
[2015.40 - 2019.20] Decades I've been helping people they
[2016.84 - 2022.20] catch the flu every year couple of times
[2019.20 - 2025.04] a year worst flues ever mucus everything
[2022.20 - 2028.00] bronchitis you name it sinus infections
[2025.04 - 2031.12] all of it with it misery and they
[2028.00 - 2034.84] stopped dairy products and they stopped
[2031.12 - 2036.72] getting the flu or the flu was cut down
[2034.84 - 2038.56] to a manageable level where they caught
[2036.72 - 2039.68] it once it was mild and they moved on
[2038.56 - 2044.12] with their
[2039.68 - 2046.88] life okay another one too eggs big one
[2044.12 - 2048.84] really does feed the flu virus so cold
[2046.88 - 2051.08] season you don't want to make two
[2048.84 - 2052.60] scrambled eggs if you do make two
[2051.08 - 2054.16] scrambled eggs for breakfast during cold
[2052.60 - 2056.36] and flu season or whatever during that
[2054.16 - 2059.36] time and I still say cold even though
[2056.36 - 2062.76] they don't exist anymore it's all flu
[2059.36 - 2064.68] but it's by habit just so many years but
[2062.76 - 2066.36] the bottom line is you put put some
[2064.68 - 2068.20] garlic on that toast then if you're
[2066.36 - 2070.00] going to have egg and toast put some
[2068.20 - 2072.12] garlic on it if you're going to have
[2070.00 - 2074.16] butter you I mean I know you know people
[2072.12 - 2076.84] like yeah but grass-fed butter is the
[2074.16 - 2078.36] best and that's no yeah that's better
[2076.84 - 2080.36] absolutely that's better because it's
[2078.36 - 2083.36] going to lack it's going to lack all
[2080.36 - 2086.24] that you know that GMO grain inside of
[2083.36 - 2088.72] it it's going to lack you know all of
[2086.24 - 2090.24] that um hormone and everything that's
[2088.72 - 2092.88] added it's going to lack it's going to
[2090.24 - 2094.96] be reduced in heavy metals I get it so
[2092.88 - 2097.28] sure you have the grass-fed butter it's
[2094.96 - 2099.48] still going to feed a flu so if you're
[2097.28 - 2101.76] having a flu cold and you make some
[2099.48 - 2103.56] scrambled eggs and you have some toast
[2101.76 - 2107.88] with some butter put some garlic in
[2103.56 - 2109.08] there you got to try to help defend also
[2107.88 - 2111.20] put something in there that's going to
[2109.08 - 2113.44] be killing off the flu
[2111.20 - 2115.24] virus at the same time you're trying to
[2113.44 - 2118.88] feed the flu virus by
[2115.24 - 2121.92] accident so you know and that's that's
[2118.88 - 2123.32] an option you can do you know and I
[2121.92 - 2125.00] offer that option because some people
[2123.32 - 2127.60] they just like they like their toast and
[2125.00 - 2128.92] butter they they love it
[2127.60 - 2130.16] and they catch a cold and flu and they
[2128.92 - 2131.72] have tea and they have toast and butter

[2773.08 - 2780.16] powerhouse it's incredible for for sore
[2776.56 - 2781.72] throats okay now there's what happens
[2780.16 - 2784.28] with sore throats there's a lot of
[2781.72 - 2787.24] things that cause different sore throats
[2784.28 - 2790.80] that aren't flu Rel needed but their
[2787.24 - 2793.04] strep their lowgrade chronic strep now
[2790.80 - 2794.72] just because someone has a sore throat
[2793.04 - 2796.36] and a doctor they go see the doctor and
[2794.72 - 2797.88] the doctor does a swab on the back of
[2796.36 - 2799.88] the throat does a culture and strep
[2797.88 - 2802.40] doesn't show up doesn't mean it's not
[2799.88 - 2805.72] strep related the only time the strep
[2802.40 - 2808.48] shows up from a culture is when it's at
[2805.72 - 2810.32] its earlier times when someone has strep
[2808.48 - 2813.00] throat it's like when when uh children
[2810.32 - 2817.76] or young adults have a really bad case a
[2813.00 - 2819.36] white pocket bubbles up on the tonsil or
[2817.76 - 2822.04] the back of the throat to the sides of
[2819.36 - 2824.72] the tonsils and that's swabble that's
[2822.04 - 2827.28] swabble you could run a culture on that
[2824.72 - 2830.88] but after that a lot of times people can
[2827.28 - 2832.64] get sore throats and it not be you can't
[2830.88 - 2835.36] do that you stick the swab down there
[2832.64 - 2837.96] the the strep is in the lymphatic system
[2835.36 - 2841.32] chronically underlying inside the
[2837.96 - 2843.84] lymphatic system and it's causing sore
[2841.32 - 2846.24] throats so that's something to
[2843.84 - 2850.84] understand too strep is just that's how
[2846.24 - 2854.04] works okay you can also have an Epstein
[2850.84 - 2857.88] bar sore throat you can have a mono sore
[2854.04 - 2859.84] throat a mono sore throat um that is a
[2857.88 - 2862.36] virus meaning it's a mono virus abine
[2859.84 - 2864.16] bar virus causing a red sore throat on
[2862.36 - 2865.68] one side of the throat that hurts really
[2864.16 - 2867.00] bad I'm giving you some different stuff
[2865.68 - 2868.40] about sore throats that are separate
[2867.00 - 2871.64] from
[2868.40 - 2873.80] flues and so where you never develop uh
[2871.64 - 2875.68] you never develop sinusitis you never
[2873.80 - 2878.00] develop mucus you're not coughing ever
[2875.68 - 2879.60] ever but you get this wicked sore throat
[2878.00 - 2881.76] on the left side of your throat did
[2879.60 - 2883.28] anybody ever get that and the wicked
[2881.76 - 2886.00] sore throat on the right side of the
[2883.28 - 2888.32] throat or sometimes both but yet it
[2886.00 - 2891.24] doesn't turn into mucus it doesn't turn
[2888.32 - 2894.64] into a fever that's an Epstein bar
[2891.24 - 2896.48] related sore throat that people get all
[2894.64 - 2898.68] the time believe it or not when Epstein
[2896.48 - 2900.20] bar starts to go and surfaces up through
[2898.68 - 2902.16] the lymphatic system and gets to the
[2900.20 - 2904.52] throat when you get run down it's a
[2902.16 - 2906.48] different level of chronic mono people
[2904.52 - 2909.96] experienc in their life every now and
[2906.48 - 2913.04] then so that's just a tidbit too that I
[2909.96 - 2915.52] thought I'd cover as well um I hope this
[2913.04 - 2916.88] Show's been helpful I hope it has these
[2915.52 - 2919.36] are some of the things you can do to
[2916.88 - 2921.40] protect yourself um when you go on
[2919.36 - 2924.64] airplanes take handy wipes when you go
[2921.40 - 2926.32] on airplanes airplanes are Petri dishes
[2924.64 - 2929.08] they are Petri dishes it's like sitting
[2926.32 - 2931.68] in a Petri dish it's like basking in a
[2929.08 - 2934.12] Petri dish you know the funny thing is
[2931.68 - 2935.44] when I'm on the airplane um Spirit
[2934.12 - 2937.32] doesn't stop telling me what's wrong
[2935.44 - 2939.76] with every single person on the airplane
[2937.32 - 2943.32] so when I get on there okay when I get
[2939.76 - 2945.24] on there it's it's um there's it's
[2943.32 - 2947.48] really funny I got to tell you something
[2945.24 - 2950.16] I used to think let me be the first one
[2947.48 - 2952.32] on the plane to sit in the back the way
[2950.16 - 2954.96] back the last seat in the back I'll try
[2952.32 - 2956.72] to get I always think let me go sit in
[2954.96 - 2958.96] the last seat so I don't have to watch
[2956.72 - 2960.88] everybody walk down the aisle by me so I
[2958.96 - 2965.04] could do readings but what happens then
[2960.88 - 2966.92] is I can see everybody in front of me
[2965.04 - 2969.64] ahead of me when you're sitting way in
[2966.92 - 2971.40] the back you just see a a sea of people
[2969.64 - 2974.12] and and then spirit's giving me readings
[2971.40 - 2976.00] on every single person I'm looking at so
[2974.12 - 2979.44] then I thought let me sit at the front
[2976.00 - 2981.84] of the plane in any way I can capacity
[2979.44 - 2984.20] and then but then everybody walking by
[2981.84 - 2986.04] me as I'm sitting there you you know you
[2984.20 - 2988.24] get the read on so it's really funny
[2986.04 - 2991.60] I've tried to dodge it the best I can
[2988.24 - 2993.44] but what happens is spirit will be like
[2991.60 - 2995.32] that person's got a flu it's it's it's
[2993.44 - 2997.44] in the middle of the stage of the flu
[2995.32 - 2999.04] that person just is getting the flu that
[2997.44 - 3001.36] person's cough they're getting over the
[2999.04 - 3003.48] flu that person has pneumonia that
[3001.36 - 3005.48] person has bronchitis so every three
[3003.48 - 3008.08] people that person is going to get the
[3005.48 - 3010.48] flu in three days that person is going
[3008.08 - 3013.12] to get it a week from now so spirit's
[3010.48 - 3016.76] telling me this as each person's walking
[3013.12 - 3019.00] by down the aisle and then spirit says
[3016.76 - 3024.44] that person has
[3019.00 - 3026.60] tuberculosis that person has this and it
[3024.44 - 3028.16] goes on that person person just came
[3026.60 - 3029.88] from visiting a family member in a
[3028.16 - 3032.44] hospital and has
[3029.88 - 3034.16] Mera so this is how it works when I sit
[3032.44 - 3037.16] on the plane and they walk but everybody
[3034.16 - 3039.72] walks by so I like to bring handy
[3037.16 - 3042.20] wipes and if you want you can be as bold
[3039.72 - 3044.32] as bringing an n95 mask or some kind of
[3042.20 - 3046.40] mask you know little little Hospital
[3044.32 - 3048.76] mask but you know that's that's another
[3046.40 - 3051.12] option too you have to prevent catching
[3048.76 - 3053.64] something on planes I'm trying not to
[3051.12 - 3055.44] make you you know phobic about it all
[3053.64 - 3057.52] I'm just saying in the height of the
[3055.44 - 3059.72] season even though the flu goes all year
[3057.52 - 3061.92] like I talked about before in the height
[3059.72 - 3064.00] of the season in the winter when you
[3061.92 - 3066.32] don't want to catch it because it's you
[3064.00 - 3068.48] know Zer degrees outside and you want to
[3066.32 - 3070.08] function and battle the elements you
[3068.48 - 3072.16] know you just got to look out if you can
[3070.08 - 3073.72] bring the handy wipes wipe off your seat
[3072.16 - 3076.52] in the side of your seat or something
[3073.72 - 3078.16] that the arm rests and uh Keep Your
[3076.52 - 3080.44] Hands Clean don't put your fingers in
[3078.16 - 3081.76] your eyes you know when I sit on a plane
[3080.44 - 3083.16] I watch people rubbing their eyes they
[3081.76 - 3084.72] take off their glasses and they just
[3083.16 - 3086.60] rubbing their eyes then they go to use
[3084.72 - 3088.52] the bathroom they grab the bathroom
[3086.60 - 3090.88] handle and they go in there and watch
[3088.52 - 3092.40] them grab the bathroom handle and go in
[3090.88 - 3094.00] and they use the bathroom don't wash
[3092.40 - 3095.36] their hands come out cuz I know I asked
[3094.00 - 3098.84] Spirit did they wash their hands spirit
[3095.36 - 3100.52] said no they come back out and they know
[3098.84 - 3101.84] touch the you know door come in they're
[3100.52 - 3103.48] rubbing their eye they're taking off
[3101.84 - 3106.72] their glasses rubbing their eyes I'm
[3103.48 - 3108.32] like well that's great so the so look
[3106.72 - 3109.96] out for those things take your handy
[3108.32 - 3111.64] wipes same thing when you're in public
[3109.96 - 3113.28] restrooms and everything you can catch
[3111.64 - 3115.68] the flu by just not being you know
[3113.28 - 3117.60] mindful about your hands while wash them
[3115.68 - 3120.76] when you can use the handy wipes look
[3117.60 - 3123.32] out and then keep the zinc on hand keep
[3120.76 - 3125.80] all these other things I talked about on
[3123.32 - 3127.52] hand you know these herbs red Roots
[3125.80 - 3129.68] another herb that can be helpful so you
[3127.52 - 3132.72] can look up red root try to find that
[3129.68 - 3136.80] alcohol-free that one's also helpful too
[3132.72 - 3139.20] so bring that on board so you know the
[3136.80 - 3141.88] bottom line is this is

[3157.68 - 3163.80] battling the elements of a flu you don't
[3160.20 - 3165.56] want to battle that on top of it all and
[3163.80 - 3167.80] some people they just battle their
[3165.56 - 3169.92] chronic illness and they they do pretty
[3167.80 - 3172.84] good they don't get a flu too often they
[3169.92 - 3174.88] stay away from them they don't get sick
[3172.84 - 3178.36] too often with the other outside you
