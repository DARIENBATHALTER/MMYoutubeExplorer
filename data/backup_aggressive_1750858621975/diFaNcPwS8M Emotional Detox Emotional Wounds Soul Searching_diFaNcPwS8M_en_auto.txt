[29.16 - 34.04] we're going to talk about some other
[30.30 - 34.04] stuff too good to see you guys
[34.26 - 36.44] foreign
[37.08 - 41.12] so everybody is soul searching
[41.70 - 46.74] someone once told me
[44.34 - 48.42] you're either soul searching
[46.74 - 51.78] or you're not
[48.42 - 54.00] and then Spirit of compassion said
[51.78 - 57.18] you're either soul-searching
[54.00 - 60.14] or you're soul-searching
[57.18 - 63.90] because that's the truth
[60.14 - 65.70] even if somebody doesn't know it even if
[63.90 - 67.98] they don't call it that so that's
[65.70 - 70.62] another thing like
[67.98 - 73.14] you may run into somebody
[70.62 - 74.82] and
[73.14 - 77.34] it doesn't seem they don't think they're
[74.82 - 81.44] soul-searching on any level they're just
[77.34 - 81.44] doing their thing living their life
[81.54 - 85.74] but they don't know their soul searching
[84.06 - 88.26] they're soul-searching but they don't
[85.74 - 90.30] call it that
[88.26 - 93.20] they're not aware that it's
[90.30 - 93.20] soul-searching right
[93.24 - 98.30] we soul-search because part of us feels
[95.94 - 98.30] lost
[98.58 - 103.80] how many people do you know have that
[101.46 - 107.22] feeling of being lost that lost
[103.80 - 110.60] sensation like a sadness
[107.22 - 110.60] at a certain time of day
[110.88 - 116.58] what if it's like three four o'clock in
[113.34 - 118.62] the afternoon and then a strange sadness
[116.58 - 120.48] comes over
[118.62 - 122.88] I know so many people that have it at
[120.48 - 125.88] different times and it's this thing you
[122.88 - 127.26] can't really explain but it's there if
[125.88 - 128.34] you guys just got on here we're talking

[130.92 - 134.00] emotions a little bit
[134.94 - 141.00] we Soul search because part of us feels
[137.10 - 143.76] lost or we don't feel whole like there's
[141.00 - 146.82] a piece of us missing
[143.76 - 149.40] like we're not all of our pieces aren't
[146.82 - 153.50] there in place right it's just there's a
[149.40 - 153.50] piece of ourselves missing
[158.04 - 162.90] or because we feel like we're not living
[160.56 - 166.74] up to our Soul's potential we
[162.90 - 168.72] soul-search because of life's hardships
[166.74 - 170.16] that's another thing too is life's
[168.72 - 172.50] hardships
[170.16 - 174.96] make it so we want to go in Soul search

[213.54 - 219.02] still an incredible you know place to go
[215.82 - 222.30] and read and everything
[219.02 - 224.52] often a negative experience or a series
[222.30 - 226.92] of them will prompt a person to feel
[224.52 - 229.08] broken or depleted did you ever feel
[226.92 - 230.82] broken or depleted like you just had
[229.08 - 232.38] something happen in your life
[230.82 - 234.42] right
[232.38 - 237.18] something happened in your life and it
[234.42 - 241.22] just pushed you over the edge
[237.18 - 241.22] like you were on your last tether
[241.38 - 246.72] if you were a bird you felt like you
[243.66 - 249.14] were on your last feathers I mean where
[246.72 - 253.44] you just felt like you were pushed over
[249.14 - 255.24] hanging on the cliff like done
[253.44 - 256.80] did you ever use that term where you're
[255.24 - 258.78] like I'm done
[256.80 - 261.32] I'm done
[258.78 - 261.32] right
[262.08 - 266.28] so many people have felt like that where
[264.60 - 268.20] they're at a place where like okay I'm
[266.28 - 270.96] done or this relationship so many people
[268.20 - 272.88] they're in a relationship that's toxic
[270.96 - 274.62] there's a lot of emotional turmoil in
[272.88 - 276.12] the relationship there's a lot going on
[274.62 - 278.04] in the relationship and they're just
[276.12 - 281.36] like I'm done I can't take this anymore
[278.04 - 281.36] I can't handle this anymore
[282.60 - 286.44] so often a negative experience or a
[284.70 - 289.62] series of them will prompt a person to
[286.44 - 291.84] feel broken or depleted and want to feel
[289.62 - 294.12] complete again it's like I want to feel
[291.84 - 296.22] whole again I want to feel like myself
[294.12 - 298.44] again and maybe I don't even know what
[296.22 - 299.70] myself felt like but I want to feel it I
[298.44 - 301.68] want to feel
[299.70 - 305.94] like I got
[301.68 - 309.18] all those pieces of my soul back I want
[305.94 - 311.52] to feel like I'm not lost
[309.18 - 314.16] I want to feel like connected to
[311.52 - 315.72] something I want that sensation I want
[314.16 - 318.00] that feeling and if you have chronic
[315.72 - 319.62] illness and you don't feel good and
[318.00 - 322.50] you're struggling with chronic illness
[319.62 - 325.20] then it really amplifies it
[322.50 - 328.26] makes it even harder
[325.20 - 330.54] I'm glad you guys came on we're doing
[328.26 - 332.52] some deep diving into healing the soul
[330.54 - 335.34] right now what I'm doing right now with
[332.52 - 337.80] Spirit of compassion and I right now
[335.34 - 339.00] as we're reading Spirit of compassion's
[337.80 - 341.16] words right here
[339.00 - 343.32] and then
[341.16 - 345.06] I'm listening to try to get additional
[343.32 - 348.30] information from Spirit of compassion
[345.06 - 351.68] about all this about how we feel what we
[348.30 - 354.54] go through all of that so I'm reading
[351.68 - 356.78] soc's words because these are not my
[354.54 - 356.78] words
[356.88 - 363.20] these are Spirit compassions words right
[359.04 - 363.20] here it's the medical medium book series
[367.80 - 370.80] that feeling of wanting to be complete
[369.96 - 373.68] again
[370.80 - 377.82] that feeling of not wanting to feel lost
[373.68 - 382.26] that feeling of no one understands me
[377.82 - 384.30] that feeling of something's missing
[382.26 - 386.16] that's when we need that soul searching
[384.30 - 388.40] that's part of soul searching right
[386.16 - 388.40] there
[391.86 - 396.12] it can take the form of attending
[393.96 - 397.74] Retreats how many people attend Retreats
[396.12 - 399.60] they're looking for something how many
[397.74 - 402.18] people
[399.60 - 404.16] are looking for something
[402.18 - 406.56] so they'll go anywhere and they'll do
[404.16 - 408.78] anything they're looking for answers or
[406.56 - 412.04] they're looking for that piece of what's
[408.78 - 412.04] lost to come back
[412.32 - 416.10] sometimes it takes going to hear
[413.88 - 418.92] inspirational speakers seeking advice
[416.10 - 420.66] from loved ones enrolling in therapy how
[418.92 - 423.32] many people are in counseling how many
[420.66 - 426.74] people have had so many
[423.32 - 428.64] counselors emotional counselors
[426.74 - 430.56] therapists
[428.64 - 433.08] psychiatrists
[430.56 - 435.00] different forms of counselors
[433.08 - 437.10] because they're like trying to find an
[435.00 - 439.26] answer why am I thinking like this why
[437.10 - 442.44] am I struggling how come I feel so sad
[439.26 - 444.42] inside how come I feel so lost why am I
[442.44 - 447.12] going through this
[444.42 - 449.82] I need to find another therapist I need
[447.12 - 452.88] to find a therapist that understands me
[449.82 - 455.70] and can crack me
[452.88 - 458.58] because I'm hard to crack why am I such
[455.70 - 460.92] a tough nut to crack
[458.58 - 462.78] how come it feels like nobody can crack
[460.92 - 464.88] me no professional
[462.78 - 467.22] is there something wrong with me did I
[464.88 - 470.40] do something wrong am I crazy is
[467.22 - 471.90] something going wrong I mean these are
[470.40 - 474.00] feelings that we naturally feel that
[471.90 - 475.62] everybody feels at some point in their
[474.00 - 479.66] life and maybe they don't feel it now
[475.62 - 479.66] but they might feel it at another time
[483.78 - 487.92] it's what we do when we're looking to
[485.76 - 490.14] heal and Elevate our souls to strengthen
[487.92 - 492.24] our purpose in life we look for help
[490.14 - 494.28] because we want to strengthen that
[492.24 - 497.90] purpose we want to unlock something in
[494.28 - 497.90] our soul and we want to heal
[502.32 - 508.14] a lot of stuff's coming up in a lot of
[504.54 - 512.88] people that were at the light blast
[508.14 - 514.74] by the way I'm at on page 393 so p393 in
[512.88 - 516.42] Soul healing meditations and techniques
[514.74 - 518.58] this is medical meaning book one if you
[516.42 - 520.56] don't have it you might want to try to
[518.58 - 523.14] get a copy go to the library get it for
[520.56 - 526.08] free at the library or amazon.com us
[523.14 - 527.28] it's it's really discounted right now
[526.08 - 529.32] this book
[527.28 - 531.24] and it's a book that so many people
[529.32 - 533.10] found answers to what was wrong with
[531.24 - 535.92] them and how to heal and it covers
[533.10 - 538.80] emotional and spiritual and physical
[535.92 - 540.78] this is one of the most profound books
[538.80 - 542.40] out there in the world of healing for
[540.78 - 544.26] people
[542.40 - 546.36] I can say that because it's Spirit of
[544.26 - 548.82] compassion's work so I'm not being
[546.36 - 550.98] biased in the sense where it's my work
[548.82 - 554.54] it's just I'm the messenger and I wrote
[550.98 - 554.54] down the words as I heard them
[555.72 - 562.14] Reina says thank you with a heart I
[559.02 - 565.68] asked for the light to help heal my soul
[562.14 - 569.58] that has been stepped on too many times
[565.68 - 573.42] the first light blast went through me
[569.58 - 575.76] and such a release instant tears my soul
[573.42 - 577.64] feels lighter and Freer
[575.76 - 579.96] and that healing is going to continue
[577.64 - 581.52] with the light blast because the light
[579.96 - 585.20] blast isn't
[581.52 - 585.20] it isn't a person
[585.96 - 592.26] that's trying to generate the light
[588.78 - 594.30] it's not a person
[592.26 - 595.74] as many times as people who met me
[594.30 - 597.96] throughout the decades and said well
[595.74 - 600.80] that medical medium guy's a Healer go
[597.96 - 600.80] see him and everything
[601.80 - 608.22] the light comes from above and it's not
[604.26 - 611.10] man-made so I I don't I'm not perfect
[608.22 - 612.78] I'm like everybody else in the world
[611.10 - 615.18] not perfect
[612.78 - 616.62] have my own experiences I have my own
[615.18 - 618.18] baggage I've had to contend with
[616.62 - 621.24] throughout my life
[618.18 - 624.60] just like everybody else and so the
[621.24 - 627.42] light blast isn't coming from me
[624.60 - 629.82] pure it's untampered with it's coming
[627.42 - 631.32] from above and when that happens it's an
[629.82 - 633.96] entirely different experience and that's
[631.32 - 637.02] why so many people are profound in a
[633.96 - 639.20] profound results or or experiences with
[637.02 - 639.20] it
[641.64 - 646.44] your soul
[643.26 - 649.10] resides in your brain something people
[646.44 - 649.10] don't know
[650.52 - 654.80] their soul resides here
[657.18 - 660.26] and resides here
[661.80 - 666.06] now this is going to sound kind of gory
[663.66 - 668.46] I know it's kind of a little off topic
[666.06 - 670.88] but it's not really off topic it's a
[668.46 - 670.88] little gory
[671.40 - 675.38] but back in the olden days
[675.66 - 681.38] the reason why they beheaded people that
[678.60 - 684.48] was a very popular
[681.38 - 687.18] technique is because back in the olden
[684.48 - 691.76] days they sensed
[687.18 - 691.76] there was an energy all around here
[692.40 - 696.36] so what they would do is
[694.44 - 697.86] medieval times they would put it they
[696.36 - 700.88] would chop people's heads off and put
[697.86 - 700.88] their heads on spikes
[701.76 - 706.62] right or Pikes or something they would
[704.46 - 708.54] put their heads on sticks
[706.62 - 709.92] on the sides of roads and all that or
[708.54 - 712.94] they would be head people with
[709.92 - 712.94] Guillotines right
[713.28 - 717.84] for some reason they felt like that was
[716.10 - 720.00] the most satisfying way to end
[717.84 - 721.92] somebody's life because there was
[720.00 - 723.96] something more satiating about it in the
[721.92 - 725.28] medieval days and what they what they
[723.96 - 727.62] were actually tapping into without
[725.28 - 729.54] realizing it there was a lot going on
[727.62 - 731.40] here
[729.54 - 733.14] but they didn't know that's where the
[731.40 - 735.66] soul resides and that's why they had a
[733.14 - 738.78] desire to behead people because the soul
[735.66 - 741.78] resided in the head
[738.78 - 743.76] they didn't know that
[741.78 - 745.88] they didn't know the soul resided in the
[743.76 - 745.88] head
[745.98 - 750.00] but they had this innate desire when
[748.32 - 751.92] they wanted to end somebody's life to
[750.00 - 755.28] behead them to chop off their head that
[751.92 - 758.72] was what that is why they did that and
[755.28 - 761.58] then they had this innate desire to
[758.72 - 762.90] exhibit someone's head chopped off they
[761.58 - 766.20] had this innate desire to actually
[762.90 - 768.60] exhibit it so exhibit the head on a pike
[766.20 - 771.06] on the sides of Roads or in villages
[768.60 - 772.74] where they would slay a village and then
[771.06 - 775.26] they would chop off everybody's head and
[772.74 - 779.64] put it on Pikes because
[775.26 - 782.22] they felt that a message was sent more
[779.64 - 785.30] because and what it was was what they
[782.22 - 785.30] were detecting
[785.76 - 791.04] yeah it's gory but what they were what
[788.16 - 793.14] they were detecting was there was more
[791.04 - 795.42] energy here even though the whole body
[793.14 - 797.34] there was more body weight and body mass
[795.42 - 799.62] everywhere else there was more energy
[797.34 - 801.30] here
[799.62 - 804.26] so what they were detecting without
[801.30 - 806.88] release without
[804.26 - 809.46] realizing it they were detecting the
[806.88 - 811.02] soul was here inside the brain so they
[809.46 - 812.82] had a great desire if they wanted to end
[811.02 - 815.04] somebody's life back in the in the
[812.82 - 818.18] medieval the Dark Ages they would
[815.04 - 818.18] chop off the head
[820.50 - 827.16] your soul resides in your brain
[824.70 - 828.66] where your soul stores memories and
[827.16 - 831.18] experiences
[828.66 - 833.94] that's where your soul is storing
[831.18 - 836.70] memories and experiences
[833.94 - 839.34] they're in the soul when our soul leaves
[836.70 - 843.56] our body it takes
[839.34 - 843.56] these experiences with it
[844.88 - 851.64] when you pass from this Mortal Realm
[848.76 - 856.38] your soul carries
[851.64 - 858.66] those memories as it moves onward
[856.38 - 862.04] your soul carries those memories as it
[858.66 - 862.04] moves onward if you guys want to know
[862.38 - 866.94] I'm reading at a medical medium I think
[865.02 - 868.68] what people don't know if they don't
[866.94 - 870.06] read the medical medium books you know
[868.68 - 871.76] how you know when someone didn't read
[870.06 - 874.38] the medical media books
[871.76 - 876.36] this is just on another note you guys we
[874.38 - 879.42] got a lot to cover but
[876.36 - 882.30] let's get bear with me my silliness but
[879.42 - 885.06] you know how you know someone did did
[882.30 - 887.10] not read the medical medium books is
[885.06 - 889.98] when they say there's no emotional
[887.10 - 893.40] healing in medical medium information
[889.98 - 897.00] and there's no emotional detoxification
[893.40 - 900.30] healing or emotional work
[897.00 - 902.16] the medical medium books
[900.30 - 904.94] and there's no or they'll say there's no
[902.16 - 908.16] emotional support it's like
[904.94 - 910.20] oh you didn't read the books you just
[908.16 - 912.60] called yourself out pretty much that
[910.20 - 914.16] means you've read about celery juice in
[912.60 - 916.56] one of the books a little bit and then
[914.16 - 918.12] you just kind of like maybe you did the
[916.56 - 920.16] heavy metal detox movie but you never
[918.12 - 922.62] read the books they're so packed with
[920.16 - 925.26] emotional support it's insane
[922.62 - 927.60] every time a doctor friend or a friend
[925.26 - 929.28] or somebody I know
[927.60 - 930.42] picks up the books again they start
[929.28 - 932.10] reading them they're like I've never
[930.42 - 934.38] seen so much emotional support in my
[932.10 - 936.06] life in a book that also has medical and
[934.38 - 937.62] physical combined it's the craziest
[936.06 - 941.66] thing
[937.62 - 941.66] anyway so I'm in medical medium book one
[942.96 - 949.74] so when we pass from this Mortal place
[946.14 - 952.68] this Mortal realm right our soul carries
[949.74 - 955.20] these memories as it moves onward even
[952.68 - 957.24] if someone has a brain injury or brain
[955.20 - 959.82] disease that keeps her or him from
[957.24 - 961.80] remembering certain things so
[959.82 - 964.62] hear this for a second so if somebody
[961.80 - 967.38] has Alzheimer's dementia
[964.62 - 970.08] if someone is losing their train of
[967.38 - 975.14] thought losing their mind
[970.08 - 975.14] and they pass away from a brain disease
[977.22 - 981.60] even if someone has a brain injury or
[979.98 - 984.36] brain disease like Alzheimer's or
[981.60 - 987.18] dementia or something like that
[984.36 - 989.22] encephalopathy right that keeps her or
[987.18 - 991.14] him from remembering certain things the
[989.22 - 993.30] soul will bring all those memories with
[991.14 - 995.94] it when that person passes on if you
[993.30 - 998.34] have a grandfather a grandmother or a
[995.94 - 1000.44] family member or a friend that is losing
[998.34 - 1002.66] their mind because they have the
[1000.44 - 1004.46] Alzheimer's they have dementia they're
[1002.66 - 1005.84] really suffering they don't even know
[1004.46 - 1009.86] who they are they lose their memory
[1005.84 - 1013.16] completely and they pass away
[1009.86 - 1015.68] you have to remember something
[1013.16 - 1018.26] the pain and suffering a loved one has
[1015.68 - 1020.00] says where did their memories go don't
[1018.26 - 1021.80] they remember me how come they don't
[1020.00 - 1022.94] remember me how come they don't see who
[1021.80 - 1025.16] I am
[1022.94 - 1028.28] my grandfather's sitting there and he
[1025.16 - 1031.28] knows me I he raised me I'm walking into
[1028.28 - 1034.84] the room and my grandfather's saying how
[1031.28 - 1034.84] are you I don't know who you are
[1035.66 - 1039.62] you have to remember that every member
[1037.76 - 1041.48] memory that that grandfather has
[1039.62 - 1044.00] grandmother that friend that mother
[1041.48 - 1046.10] father that brother sister every memory
[1044.00 - 1050.60] that they have about you in their life
[1046.10 - 1053.78] is still trapped in there it's in there
[1050.60 - 1055.88] just because the brain disease is eating
[1053.78 - 1057.62] away neurons it doesn't mean the soul
[1055.88 - 1059.24] doesn't take those memories with it
[1057.62 - 1061.04] that's the whole point and what I
[1059.24 - 1065.24] learned from Spirit of compassion is the
[1061.04 - 1066.98] soul takes those memories with
[1065.24 - 1069.32] with it
[1066.98 - 1071.60] as it leaves
[1069.32 - 1074.42] so it's not like that family member
[1071.60 - 1076.76] their lives are just completely wiped
[1074.42 - 1080.42] out and completely gone it's not like
[1076.76 - 1081.98] that at all it it's the opposite yes in
[1080.42 - 1084.80] that moment it feels that way but when
[1081.98 - 1086.24] they leave and their soul passes on they
[1084.80 - 1089.36] have all the memories there they didn't
[1086.24 - 1090.52] lose that they know who you are
[1089.36 - 1093.08] foreign
[1090.52 - 1095.66] father grandmother or friend or family
[1093.08 - 1098.60] member's soul is leaving them as they
[1095.66 - 1101.42] pass in that moment even if they lost
[1098.60 - 1104.90] ability to understand who you were as
[1101.42 - 1107.78] they were fading away they still when
[1104.90 - 1110.98] they leave and that Soul lifts up
[1107.78 - 1110.98] from that body
[1111.86 - 1117.38] they instantly know you
[1115.40 - 1119.78] Who You Are
[1117.38 - 1122.18] every memory they shared with you
[1119.78 - 1123.86] everything about you all that they've
[1122.18 - 1127.64] done with you every experience they've
[1123.86 - 1131.72] ever had with you they know and they see
[1127.64 - 1133.90] it and see you as their soul leaves the
[1131.72 - 1133.90] body
[1138.98 - 1144.32] I think someone said I never knew that
[1142.10 - 1146.00] the information's not out there
[1144.32 - 1148.70] unless it was
[1146.00 - 1150.14] taken from the medical medium books but
[1148.70 - 1152.48] this is all Spirit of compassion's
[1150.14 - 1153.56] information there's no citations in the
[1152.48 - 1156.32] books ever
[1153.56 - 1159.32] ever because I'm not taking one piece of
[1156.32 - 1162.86] information from anyone
[1159.32 - 1166.84] so there's no citations the books are
[1162.86 - 1166.84] just unique information from above
[1168.14 - 1172.76] your soul also stores your hope people
[1171.14 - 1174.98] don't realize that that their soul
[1172.76 - 1177.80] actually stores their hope you think you
[1174.98 - 1180.08] you think you're hopeless you're not
[1177.80 - 1182.86] you think you have no hope anymore uh-uh
[1180.08 - 1182.86] that's not true
[1183.20 - 1188.30] you think you've lost all your hope no
[1185.96 - 1190.46] no no no no no no no no
[1188.30 - 1194.72] you didn't lose all your hope
[1190.46 - 1197.68] your hope is stored it's stored
[1194.72 - 1197.68] in your soul
[1198.14 - 1205.66] there's a well of it in your soul
[1201.86 - 1205.66] your soul also stores faith
[1210.62 - 1214.40] if you have faith in God your soul
[1212.42 - 1218.86] stores that faith if you have faith in
[1214.40 - 1218.86] Jesus Christ your soul stores that faith
[1219.74 - 1225.86] see there's a question on Instagram
[1221.92 - 1228.56] heal with Haley says why can't we
[1225.86 - 1231.70] access the memories our soul already has
[1228.56 - 1231.70] from before this life
[1237.44 - 1240.86] there's a reason
[1239.00 - 1242.60] Spirit of compassion has told me my
[1240.86 - 1244.28] whole life why
[1242.60 - 1246.52] and I'm going to be sharing about that
[1244.28 - 1246.52] soon
[1247.22 - 1251.06] I read that comment because I plan on
[1249.02 - 1253.64] sharing about that soon
[1251.06 - 1256.04] and it's going to be mind-blowing
[1253.64 - 1257.48] absolutely mind-blowing
[1256.04 - 1259.16] but I have to share about it properly
[1257.48 - 1262.46] too so people
[1259.16 - 1264.08] cite the source
[1262.46 - 1265.46] because someone's just going to take it
[1264.08 - 1266.78] next you know it someone's going to say
[1265.46 - 1269.08] oh
[1266.78 - 1271.64] this heat well-known
[1269.08 - 1272.96] Mastermind guy or healer or whatever you
[1271.64 - 1274.40] wouldn't believe what he said and
[1272.96 - 1276.32] they're just gonna just butcher it
[1274.40 - 1277.88] they're gonna butcher it because they
[1276.32 - 1280.10] don't know all of it and they're gonna
[1277.88 - 1283.42] try to run with a golden nugget so they
[1280.10 - 1287.30] can get more likes and views
[1283.42 - 1290.18] and sell more programs
[1287.30 - 1291.86] so we got to do it right so people have
[1290.18 - 1294.46] all of the info and they know where to
[1291.86 - 1296.50] get it so they can heal
[1294.46 - 1300.68] foreign
[1296.50 - 1302.78] also stores your faith that means if you
[1300.68 - 1306.14] have faith in Jesus Christ your soul
[1302.78 - 1307.82] stores it if you think you if you're if
[1306.14 - 1309.44] you're a Christian and you have faith in
[1307.82 - 1311.42] Jesus Christ that for some reason you're
[1309.44 - 1314.66] a Christian and you lost faith in Jesus
[1311.42 - 1318.76] Christ I promise you this your soul
[1314.66 - 1318.76] still has faith in Jesus Christ
[1324.26 - 1328.10] if you're someone that's not a Christian
[1325.82 - 1330.38] and you just believe in God and God
[1328.10 - 1331.94] God is who you believe in and you have
[1330.38 - 1333.38] faith in God and you have tremendous
[1331.94 - 1334.82] faith in God and then all of a sudden
[1333.38 - 1337.04] something happens to you in your life
[1334.82 - 1339.38] and you lose faith in God I promise you
[1337.04 - 1342.58] this your soul still stores
[1339.38 - 1342.58] your faith in God
[1345.32 - 1350.30] Thomas Phoenix 82 on Instagram said I
[1348.92 - 1352.64] wanted to die
[1350.30 - 1355.64] and now I have my life back and it's all
[1352.64 - 1359.02] because of medical medium info thank you
[1355.64 - 1362.56] aw and SOC
[1359.02 - 1362.56] sfc says you're welcome
[1363.34 - 1366.34] all right
[1367.76 - 1371.72] if you think you lost trust and you had
[1370.76 - 1373.40] Trust
[1371.72 - 1376.40] and now you can't trust anything anymore
[1373.40 - 1378.98] and you can't trust anyone anymore
[1376.40 - 1381.14] you can't trust anyone you can't trust
[1378.98 - 1384.76] anything anymore because you lost trust
[1381.14 - 1384.76] I can promise you this
[1385.40 - 1391.96] that you have trust stored
[1389.06 - 1391.96] in your soul
[1394.46 - 1398.96] the reason for that is it helps to keep
[1396.20 - 1401.90] us on the right path so we stay
[1398.96 - 1405.14] stay present here
[1401.90 - 1406.58] ideally we would all have fully intact
[1405.14 - 1408.74] Souls
[1406.58 - 1411.50] over the course of life's hardships
[1408.74 - 1413.24] though a soul can become fractured and
[1411.50 - 1416.14] even loose pieces of itself but that's
[1413.24 - 1416.14] okay because
[1417.20 - 1421.00] we still never lose our soul
[1421.94 - 1425.96] this can be caused by traumatic events
[1424.04 - 1428.18] traumatic events can fracture our soul
[1425.96 - 1431.54] but that's all right
[1428.18 - 1434.98] because her soul can mend and heal
[1431.54 - 1437.48] our soul is unbreakable it is
[1434.98 - 1440.18] unbreakable regardless of a fracture
[1437.48 - 1441.56] regardless
[1440.18 - 1444.26] of
[1441.56 - 1446.72] hardships beating it down and wearing
[1444.26 - 1449.72] and tearing on your soul it is
[1446.72 - 1449.72] Unbreakable
[1452.18 - 1456.32] this can be caused by traumatic events
[1454.22 - 1458.00] such as the death of a loved one so many
[1456.32 - 1460.88] people go through
[1458.00 - 1463.46] betrayal by a loved one or betrayal of
[1460.88 - 1465.38] oneself as well as ongoing traumas such
[1463.46 - 1467.06] as the loss of freedom and trust that
[1465.38 - 1469.46] comes with experiencing chronic symptoms
[1467.06 - 1471.38] and illness I think so many people have
[1469.46 - 1473.42] been beaten down with their illness
[1471.38 - 1475.76] you guys know about that
[1473.42 - 1477.32] you had symptoms
[1475.76 - 1478.82] or you still have them because you just
[1477.32 - 1480.56] found medical medium and you're working
[1478.82 - 1482.60] on your healing process but you bend
[1480.56 - 1485.54] down that road and you had so many
[1482.60 - 1490.36] symptoms and suffered greatly so bad and
[1485.54 - 1490.36] that wears and tears on the soul
[1494.90 - 1500.90] many throughout the years I would
[1499.16 - 1504.38] through a process that Spirit of
[1500.90 - 1506.42] compassion has has taught me to scan
[1504.38 - 1509.30] someone
[1506.42 - 1513.40] and spirit of compassion would show me
[1509.30 - 1513.40] if they had any fractures on their soul
[1514.94 - 1519.98] and it resembled cracks in a cathedral
[1517.52 - 1521.06] window that's what it resembled when I
[1519.98 - 1523.78] would see it through Spirit of
[1521.06 - 1523.78] compassion's eyes
[1526.28 - 1529.04] because the soul is made out of light
[1527.90 - 1531.76] and when someone's been through
[1529.04 - 1531.76] hardships
[1534.92 - 1541.06] so I think we have a tech problem
[1537.56 - 1541.06] so I'm just trying to fix it here
[1546.56 - 1549.16] okay
[1551.00 - 1554.92] because our soul is made out of light
[1555.20 - 1561.52] because
[1556.64 - 1561.52] our souls are a form of light
[1561.74 - 1567.02] not when a soul is fractured
[1564.56 - 1569.42] it looks like the sun it looks like the
[1567.02 - 1571.46] inside like you're inside a
[1569.42 - 1573.80] the church
[1571.46 - 1577.66] and the stained glass windows
[1573.80 - 1577.66] there's light coming through the Sun
[1579.50 - 1583.64] as for a soul with missing pieces it's
[1581.66 - 1585.92] like a house at night that's meant to
[1583.64 - 1589.36] have all its lights on except some of
[1585.92 - 1589.36] its rooms are still dark
[1593.06 - 1596.62] when Soul injuries are fresh
[1598.46 - 1601.82] they can result in the feeling of being
[1600.50 - 1603.98] lost
[1601.82 - 1606.40] foreign
[1603.98 - 1609.50] or a loss of connection with oneself
[1606.40 - 1611.96] loss of Desire or inspiration to
[1609.50 - 1613.52] preserve or Thrive so many people lose
[1611.96 - 1615.26] their Inspirations they feel like
[1613.52 - 1617.48] they're dead inside they feel like they
[1615.26 - 1619.16] died inside they're numb and they don't
[1617.48 - 1621.08] feel like there's anything left in them
[1619.16 - 1623.32] they feel like there's nothing there
[1621.08 - 1623.32] anymore
[1623.60 - 1629.12] they feel like
[1626.00 - 1630.92] they are not being seen by anything and
[1629.12 - 1633.62] they're completely alone and completely
[1630.92 - 1636.14] in the dark and that's what happens when
[1633.62 - 1637.58] Soul injuries are actually fresh it just
[1636.14 - 1641.12] happened
[1637.58 - 1643.88] I just got let down that person broke my
[1641.12 - 1646.52] trust I feel so injured I feel so
[1643.88 - 1648.80] misunderstood and not heard so when the
[1646.52 - 1651.68] soul injuries are fresh they could
[1648.80 - 1654.58] result in feeling like
[1651.68 - 1654.58] you're lost
[1657.14 - 1660.44] or there's a loss of connection like
[1659.00 - 1661.58] where's the connection there's no
[1660.44 - 1664.46] connection
[1661.58 - 1667.66] a loss of Desire or inspiration to
[1664.46 - 1667.66] persevere or thrive
[1668.36 - 1673.04] or even
[1669.92 - 1674.90] like life force how many that you guys
[1673.04 - 1677.12] know that where you feel like you lose
[1674.90 - 1678.80] your life force
[1677.12 - 1681.74] because you just
[1678.80 - 1684.32] had such a hard time
[1681.74 - 1686.80] that's why it's important to be aware of
[1684.32 - 1689.60] our soul and that's how you heal
[1686.80 - 1691.82] emotional support is understanding our
[1689.60 - 1693.62] own soul because people they don't
[1691.82 - 1695.90] realize they have this connection to
[1693.62 - 1698.30] their own soul they don't know how to
[1695.90 - 1700.82] connect to their own soul
[1698.30 - 1703.22] when you understand your soul and and
[1700.82 - 1705.98] understand where it is and and if it's
[1703.22 - 1708.68] been injured and how strong it is and
[1705.98 - 1711.80] how powerful it is
[1708.68 - 1714.26] when you connect to your soul that's how
[1711.80 - 1717.76] you can really do some emotional healing
[1714.26 - 1717.76] and rise out of something
[1718.28 - 1723.98] that's why it's important to be aware of
[1721.04 - 1727.00] our soul wounds from hardships betrayal
[1723.98 - 1729.40] and broken trust or emotional hurt often
[1727.00 - 1732.26] exhaust a person's immune system
[1729.40 - 1734.48] adrenals and other bodies defenses
[1732.26 - 1736.52] triggering a physical issue that could
[1734.48 - 1737.60] be residing deep within our organs and
[1736.52 - 1740.18] body
[1737.60 - 1741.44] so it's twofold if you guys go through a
[1740.18 - 1742.88] hard time if somebody goes through a
[1741.44 - 1744.98] hard time
[1742.88 - 1748.82] I know a friend that just got betrayed
[1744.98 - 1751.88] so bad just so bad the Betrayal was just
[1748.82 - 1753.62] horrendous and he didn't want to live
[1751.88 - 1757.16] anymore
[1753.62 - 1761.66] but when he really understood the soul
[1757.16 - 1763.58] connection that I was teaching him about
[1761.66 - 1766.16] it was giving him a chance to say you
[1763.58 - 1768.74] know I could get through this you can't
[1766.16 - 1772.12] you can't take my soul away no one's
[1768.74 - 1772.12] going to be able to take my soul away
[1772.34 - 1777.38] but at the same time adrenals can get
[1775.22 - 1779.36] beaten down and our immune systems can
[1777.38 - 1782.18] can be lowered because we're going
[1779.36 - 1783.08] through a lot if we're betrayed it does
[1782.18 - 1785.78] play
[1783.08 - 1789.44] it does take a hit on our immune system
[1785.78 - 1792.38] and our physical body it can beat us
[1789.44 - 1794.60] down our adrenals
[1792.38 - 1797.14] you go into this
[1794.60 - 1799.76] point where
[1797.14 - 1802.88] your adrenaline just spikes and feels
[1799.76 - 1808.30] like it gets out of control if someone's
[1802.88 - 1808.30] messing with you or you had a hardship
[1808.34 - 1814.04] someone just
[1810.98 - 1815.84] you you know their trust
[1814.04 - 1817.40] you don't trust him anymore something
[1815.84 - 1820.04] happened and all of a sudden it's like
[1817.40 - 1821.54] adrenaline you can even feel like you're
[1820.04 - 1823.88] shaking
[1821.54 - 1825.26] you get so upset and hurt where you're
[1823.88 - 1828.32] shaking
[1825.26 - 1831.26] and that's the adrenaline now
[1828.32 - 1833.44] being released and takes a toll on the
[1831.26 - 1833.44] body
[1833.54 - 1839.54] sometimes a person's soul injury
[1836.72 - 1842.26] and resulting emotional state isn't a
[1839.54 - 1842.26] physical problem
[1843.44 - 1848.24] yet symptoms often take time to build
[1845.84 - 1850.58] quietly in the background so a soul
[1848.24 - 1852.20] injury at an earlier time in life could
[1850.58 - 1854.60] be the trigger
[1852.20 - 1857.62] for the future symptoms or full-blown
[1854.60 - 1857.62] conditions to come
[1858.02 - 1862.22] if you don't have the right knowledge
[1859.82 - 1864.92] tools and resources to take care of your
[1862.22 - 1866.90] soul and physical body
[1864.92 - 1869.36] we can get in trouble
[1866.90 - 1871.82] the medical medium tools are there to
[1869.36 - 1875.18] support your physical body and your
[1871.82 - 1877.88] emotional body that's how you win it's
[1875.18 - 1882.14] both they're there and even if you don't
[1877.88 - 1886.22] support your your emotional body
[1882.14 - 1888.92] and you heal physically it naturally can
[1886.22 - 1891.14] help to heal the emotional part of what
[1888.92 - 1893.54] you're going through in your life it can
[1891.14 - 1896.54] help heal the emotional
[1893.54 - 1896.54] injuries
[1899.90 - 1905.36] let's be clear
[1901.94 - 1907.22] emotional wounds and soul wounds
[1905.36 - 1909.94] are not the reason for physical
[1907.22 - 1909.94] suffering
[1910.52 - 1913.66] that's important to know
[1914.06 - 1918.38] they are not the cause of physical
[1916.10 - 1921.08] suffering
[1918.38 - 1923.54] they're not the cause of fibromyalgia
[1921.08 - 1926.54] they're not the cause
[1923.54 - 1928.76] of thyroid cancer they're not the cause
[1926.54 - 1930.32] a multiple sclerosis
[1928.76 - 1933.50] or lupus
[1930.32 - 1935.12] or Lyme disease rather they can act as
[1933.50 - 1939.38] triggers
[1935.12 - 1939.38] for underlying susceptibilities
[1939.68 - 1943.70] when we go through emotional hardships
[1941.72 - 1946.40] it cannot go so hard it lowers our
[1943.70 - 1948.38] immune system and it triggers us when we
[1946.40 - 1950.60] go through emotional hardships our
[1948.38 - 1952.76] adrenaline can really get kicked into
[1950.60 - 1955.60] high gear because we're emotionally
[1952.76 - 1958.94] injured and then we get
[1955.60 - 1962.48] knocked down a notch
[1958.94 - 1963.80] it knocks us down I can't tell you how
[1962.48 - 1966.26] many people
[1963.80 - 1968.72] that got into a difficult relationship
[1966.26 - 1970.82] and it was there was so much turmoil in
[1968.72 - 1974.00] that relationship there was so much
[1970.82 - 1976.52] fighting and cheating and betrayal and
[1974.00 - 1978.44] that relationship that it lowered the
[1976.52 - 1980.60] immune system
[1978.44 - 1983.60] and when it lowered the immune system it
[1980.60 - 1987.50] broke them down and other things they
[1983.60 - 1989.78] had residing inside of them pathogens
[1987.50 - 1992.62] rose up and now they have chronic
[1989.78 - 1992.62] fatigue syndrome
[1993.98 - 1997.66] they become triggers
[1999.44 - 2003.22] but you're stronger than you know to
[2001.84 - 2005.92] have battled this long and gotten
[2003.22 - 2007.78] yourself this far in life now you can
[2005.92 - 2010.06] rise above
[2007.78 - 2012.94] all this is knowledge so you can rise
[2010.06 - 2015.82] above your wounds you can rise above the
[2012.94 - 2017.92] injuries physically that you've had
[2015.82 - 2020.68] the pathogens
[2017.92 - 2023.68] the exposures you can rise above that
[2020.68 - 2028.02] and heal your emotions too and Rise
[2023.68 - 2028.02] Above any kind of Soul injuries
[2028.60 - 2034.96] a person with soul injury
[2032.68 - 2037.30] is vulnerable
[2034.96 - 2039.88] if you ever hear a friend say I'm not
[2037.30 - 2042.64] ready for another relationship I'm still
[2039.88 - 2045.04] hurting from my breakup
[2042.64 - 2047.32] she's acknowledging that her soul needs
[2045.04 - 2050.52] time to heal before she risks putting
[2047.32 - 2050.52] herself out there again
[2052.42 - 2057.64] so many of us know when our soul is
[2055.84 - 2059.98] vulnerable we know that we're
[2057.64 - 2061.60] susceptible we know it's like whoa I
[2059.98 - 2063.40] can't do that right now
[2061.60 - 2066.04] I can't go through that again right now
[2063.40 - 2068.32] I I need to step back a little bit my
[2066.04 - 2071.40] soul isn't feeling that strong my soul's
[2068.32 - 2071.40] not feeling strong enough
[2074.92 - 2079.42] along the same lines if you ever observe
[2077.56 - 2081.58] someone who's sick with symptoms or
[2079.42 - 2084.48] conditions and hasn't been able to find
[2081.58 - 2087.58] answers you may see this person
[2084.48 - 2089.44] hungrily pursuing spiritual learning in
[2087.58 - 2091.00] any form
[2089.44 - 2093.48] like religion
[2091.00 - 2096.52] spiritual gurus self-help books
[2093.48 - 2098.92] meditation Retreats breath work
[2096.52 - 2102.76] it's likely because that person's soul
[2098.92 - 2104.74] has been injured from all the trust lost
[2102.76 - 2107.92] along the way
[2104.74 - 2110.32] and she or he is instinctively searching
[2107.92 - 2112.92] for ways to make the soul healthy and
[2110.32 - 2112.92] complete again
[2114.46 - 2118.78] when we fall ill with symptoms that
[2116.74 - 2121.24] won't go away or that continue to come
[2118.78 - 2124.50] and go we lose trust in our body and
[2121.24 - 2124.50] others to help us
[2125.14 - 2130.06] there are people who have been sick for
[2127.18 - 2131.98] years who turn to soul-searching when
[2130.06 - 2134.20] they can't find answers and that's
[2131.98 - 2136.24] another thing too I I watched this for
[2134.20 - 2139.00] decades
[2136.24 - 2141.10] people are looking for Spiritual answers
[2139.00 - 2143.82] because no one knows why they're sick
[2141.10 - 2143.82] physically
[2144.28 - 2150.64] what was really popular back to like 30
[2147.46 - 2153.04] years ago 25 years ago was because
[2150.64 - 2154.78] nobody knew of course why anybody was
[2153.04 - 2156.52] sick with chronic illness you go and
[2154.78 - 2157.84] find somebody
[2156.52 - 2159.70] and then
[2157.84 - 2162.28] you try to find some kind of healer
[2159.70 - 2163.90] takes to give you any kind of answer and
[2162.28 - 2165.70] there's a good chance they'll tell you
[2163.90 - 2168.58] it's because you had your head chopped
[2165.70 - 2172.14] off in 1733
[2168.58 - 2172.14] in England somewhere
[2172.30 - 2176.68] and that's why you're actually sick or
[2174.64 - 2179.26] they'll say you drowned still say like
[2176.68 - 2182.74] in the 1600s you were
[2179.26 - 2185.86] you were deemed a witch in the 1600s
[2182.74 - 2190.96] and you were put to death by drowning
[2185.86 - 2192.58] because nobody knew any answers right
[2190.96 - 2194.74] I remember people would come to me and
[2192.58 - 2196.96] they'd be like well I bent every doctor
[2194.74 - 2199.06] and now I've been to every
[2196.96 - 2202.42] every psychic can heal where I can find
[2199.06 - 2203.44] around the planet and I have some I have
[2202.42 - 2206.08] some good
[2203.44 - 2207.28] good leads one lead is I was drowned as
[2206.08 - 2211.84] a witch
[2207.28 - 2213.82] in 16 in the 1600s and because of that
[2211.84 - 2216.40] that's why I'm sick and I have all these
[2213.82 - 2219.36] problems and everything else and spirit
[2216.40 - 2219.36] of compassion would say
[2219.40 - 2224.64] no
[2221.26 - 2224.64] that's not why the person's sick
[2225.94 - 2230.14] person has real
[2227.86 - 2231.52] real reasons why they're sick and those
[2230.14 - 2234.42] are the answers you find in the medical
[2231.52 - 2234.42] medium books
[2240.64 - 2245.68] sometimes soul-searching will bring
[2242.98 - 2247.36] people closer to themselves many times
[2245.68 - 2250.06] it will leave them feeling more lost
[2247.36 - 2253.06] than ever did you ever go soul searching
[2250.06 - 2256.18] and then you feel more lost than ever
[2253.06 - 2258.04] did you ever try to find yourself but
[2256.18 - 2259.84] yet you feel more lost
[2258.04 - 2262.00] did that ever happen to you
[2259.84 - 2264.78] where you're you're going to try to find
[2262.00 - 2264.78] yourself right
[2266.02 - 2270.84] and you think you're going to find
[2267.34 - 2270.84] yourself you're trying to find yourself
[2271.12 - 2275.92] and then you're like I think I found
[2273.10 - 2277.84] myself I do I think I found myself you
[2275.92 - 2279.82] guys yes everybody's saying yes but then
[2277.84 - 2280.78] all of a sudden you feel more lost than
[2279.82 - 2282.40] ever
[2280.78 - 2285.78] and then you feel like you're down a
[2282.40 - 2285.78] rabbit hole where it's worse
[2285.94 - 2288.12] foreign
[2291.36 - 2296.92] says I was probably burned at the stake
[2294.34 - 2299.26] I don't think so
[2296.92 - 2302.76] that's terrible you weren't burned by it
[2299.26 - 2302.76] you weren't burned at the stake
[2303.58 - 2308.68] many times it will leave someone feeling
[2306.34 - 2311.26] more lost than ever under the guise of
[2308.68 - 2313.36] help you may have heard the false theory
[2311.26 - 2315.70] that illness is just a cry for attention
[2313.36 - 2317.56] did you guys ever hear that the false
[2315.70 - 2320.32] theory that went around for decades at
[2317.56 - 2322.06] Medical medium information had to
[2320.32 - 2324.28] disprove
[2322.06 - 2327.72] did you ever hear that where it's a cry
[2324.28 - 2327.72] for help that's why you're sick
[2331.66 - 2335.86] you were looking for attention
[2334.12 - 2337.78] did you ever hear that one where you
[2335.86 - 2340.84] were looking for attention
[2337.78 - 2342.94] that's why you were sick yes
[2340.84 - 2344.86] you've heard that
[2342.94 - 2346.54] that's another one that has tortured
[2344.86 - 2350.62] people for years that medical medium
[2346.54 - 2353.20] info had to disprove to help people
[2350.62 - 2355.48] they give them answers I can't tell you
[2353.20 - 2357.04] how many times I've heard that like
[2355.48 - 2359.14] you're just you're just want attention
[2357.04 - 2362.86] that's that's why what you're doing
[2359.14 - 2364.72] right that's what everybody's told
[2362.86 - 2367.08] that just breaks my heart when I even
[2364.72 - 2367.08] hear that
[2367.18 - 2371.80] you may have heard that when bad things
[2369.16 - 2373.42] happen to us we cause them by thinking
[2371.80 - 2375.82] the wrong thoughts did you guys hear
[2373.42 - 2378.28] that one bad things are happening to you
[2375.82 - 2380.32] you're sick because you caused it with
[2378.28 - 2383.40] your by having the wrong thoughts did
[2380.32 - 2383.40] you guys have that one too
[2385.42 - 2390.94] like is that so yes I see that too like
[2389.14 - 2391.96] by having the wrong thoughts that's why
[2390.94 - 2394.60] you're sick
[2391.96 - 2397.54] ajada says it's such a mind screw it so
[2394.60 - 2400.54] is such a mind screw it totally is yes
[2397.54 - 2402.46] you had that too where you you caused
[2400.54 - 2404.74] your sickness by thinking the wrong
[2402.46 - 2407.98] thoughts
[2404.74 - 2411.64] see these were all made up things made
[2407.98 - 2413.14] up theories here by men
[2411.64 - 2415.30] my men
[2413.14 - 2419.40] here on the planet and women here on the
[2415.30 - 2419.40] planet it's made up theories
[2419.50 - 2426.46] and spirit of compassion is not
[2422.14 - 2428.62] from here so has Clarity on this because
[2426.46 - 2432.70] I can't tell you how many times I've had
[2428.62 - 2435.58] to rewire someone because they were
[2432.70 - 2437.26] positive they were sick because they had
[2435.58 - 2439.50] bad thoughts and that's why they were
[2437.26 - 2439.50] sick
[2447.10 - 2450.34] I've said it before and I'll say it
[2448.90 - 2453.04] again
[2450.34 - 2454.72] if you are ill or going through a trial
[2453.04 - 2457.00] like a divorce
[2454.72 - 2460.98] or a loss
[2457.00 - 2460.98] you did not manifest it
[2462.28 - 2467.44] if you are going through a sickness you
[2465.10 - 2470.44] did not manifest it
[2467.44 - 2473.08] if you are going through some type of
[2470.44 - 2475.18] feeling of like being disconnected
[2473.08 - 2477.94] feeling lost feeling hopeless and
[2475.18 - 2480.04] depressed you did not manifest it
[2477.94 - 2483.34] if you feel sadness that you can't
[2480.04 - 2484.96] explain and you feel like you don't no
[2483.34 - 2487.18] one understands you and you can't
[2484.96 - 2489.06] understand yourself you feel and you
[2487.18 - 2491.82] feel like you lost all trust in yourself
[2489.06 - 2493.96] you did not
[2491.82 - 2497.64] manifest that
[2493.96 - 2497.64] you did not attract it
[2500.08 - 2505.78] it is not punishment or payback it's not
[2503.38 - 2507.76] Karma
[2505.78 - 2509.50] if you guys have struggled and you
[2507.76 - 2511.72] suffered and something happened to you
[2509.50 - 2514.48] along the way whatever you do don't
[2511.72 - 2517.38] think it's karma paying you back
[2514.48 - 2517.38] in this lifetime
[2517.54 - 2521.74] if a child is sick you mean to tell me
[2519.70 - 2524.22] that child's karma is why that child is
[2521.74 - 2524.22] suffering
[2525.70 - 2531.12] Christina B says people all tell me that
[2528.64 - 2531.12] so much
[2535.60 - 2539.98] the one thing you'll find in the medical
[2537.64 - 2542.32] medium information is about freeing the
[2539.98 - 2544.66] brainwashing and freeing you up of the
[2542.32 - 2547.48] brainwashing and mind control that has
[2544.66 - 2548.98] been out there forever
[2547.48 - 2550.96] and that mind control is in the
[2548.98 - 2553.54] alternative arts and alternative healing
[2550.96 - 2555.10] I'm so sorry to say I really am it
[2553.54 - 2557.20] breaks my heart and kills me it's also
[2555.10 - 2560.02] in the conventional healing too in the
[2557.20 - 2564.30] conventional world that mind control and
[2560.02 - 2564.30] brain conditioning is unbelievable
[2566.92 - 2575.38] there's a spiritual war out there
[2570.46 - 2578.20] it really is and it just controls people
[2575.38 - 2580.12] purposely so those people can control
[2578.20 - 2581.74] everybody else it's like it's
[2580.12 - 2583.54] unbelievable
[2581.74 - 2585.82] you did not attract it it's not
[2583.54 - 2588.16] punishment or payback it's not your Bad
[2585.82 - 2590.26] Karma you have to know you're not sick
[2588.16 - 2593.70] because of your karma whatever you do
[2590.26 - 2593.70] you can't fall into that
[2595.72 - 2602.38] so fernica Monica says then why some
[2598.96 - 2604.24] then why are some of us so sick is it
[2602.38 - 2607.12] destiny
[2604.24 - 2610.42] go to the library
[2607.12 - 2612.58] and try to get these books out for free
[2610.42 - 2616.06] try not to even pay for them
[2612.58 - 2617.80] go to the library and get these books
[2616.06 - 2620.02] vernica
[2617.80 - 2623.88] find a library Wherever You Are
[2620.02 - 2623.88] ask them for the medical medium book
[2630.40 - 2635.80] you do not deserve to be sick or unhappy
[2632.86 - 2637.60] it's not your fault you didn't manifest
[2635.80 - 2641.02] it it's not your fault and it's not
[2637.60 - 2643.06] Karma I can promise you that
[2641.02 - 2645.40] you don't need to travel the world
[2643.06 - 2648.46] trying to find yourself I've seen people
[2645.40 - 2650.74] who have money travel the world
[2648.46 - 2652.98] to find themselves and they're still
[2650.74 - 2652.98] sick
[2653.50 - 2658.36] Miranda mccola says Anthony can you
[2656.14 - 2661.62] please clarify that God does not cause
[2658.36 - 2661.62] our suffering
[2664.30 - 2667.60] I have a tremendous amount of
[2665.86 - 2670.72] information from spiritual compassion
[2667.60 - 2672.04] about that very topic
[2670.72 - 2674.44] and
[2672.04 - 2677.44] I can tell you this
[2674.44 - 2679.60] that what I've learned my whole life
[2677.44 - 2682.60] since age four and listening and talking
[2679.60 - 2685.42] to Spirit of compassion
[2682.60 - 2690.18] what I've learned from SOC is that God
[2685.42 - 2690.18] does not cause our suffering on purpose
[2691.42 - 2694.06] so
[2692.62 - 2696.46] Darkness
[2694.06 - 2699.64] here on the planet wants us to suffer
[2696.46 - 2702.78] God is doing everything
[2699.64 - 2702.78] in God's power
[2703.00 - 2708.22] to stop that
[2705.82 - 2710.14] I'll I'll do a whole I'll do a whole
[2708.22 - 2712.06] show on that and I'll actually
[2710.14 - 2715.00] I'll actually give you the details to
[2712.06 - 2716.98] that because it The Details Matter in
[2715.00 - 2719.88] that statement I just said the details
[2716.98 - 2719.88] matter in all of it
[2722.50 - 2727.18] Soul healing is about reclaiming Who You
[2725.38 - 2730.62] Are
[2727.18 - 2730.62] because you are already
[2731.38 - 2733.98] good enough
[2734.26 - 2737.74] who you are already means more than you
[2736.72 - 2741.10] know
[2737.74 - 2743.80] you are already good enough
[2741.10 - 2747.12] it's just about healing now you are
[2743.80 - 2747.12] already good enough
[2747.94 - 2751.60] Lorraine L says the karma thing is so
[2750.10 - 2754.42] overused
[2751.60 - 2757.12] you deserve to heal
[2754.42 - 2759.72] you deserve to be happy you deserve to
[2757.12 - 2759.72] feel whole
[2783.10 - 2787.24] aw
[2785.32 - 2790.12] is there a reason
[2787.24 - 2792.42] we meet certain people like a soul
[2790.12 - 2792.42] connection
[2795.04 - 2801.12] well it all depends people meet certain
[2797.20 - 2801.12] people and it's like whoa that was
[2801.16 - 2805.84] the very hardest
[2804.04 - 2808.84] experiences I've ever had in my life
[2805.84 - 2810.88] because that certain person I met
[2808.84 - 2811.90] you know and then you meet someone it's
[2810.88 - 2814.18] like
[2811.90 - 2816.16] someone actually understands me and it's
[2814.18 - 2819.16] like the door opens
[2816.16 - 2820.96] and then you meet somebody and it's like
[2819.16 - 2824.14] how did this person get into my life
[2820.96 - 2826.48] this person is just toxic and dangerous
[2824.14 - 2828.82] in this person's in my life and I can go
[2826.48 - 2830.62] into details too on details too on how
[2828.82 - 2833.20] that all happens these are all topics
[2830.62 - 2835.72] that I've I've fleshed out greatly with
[2833.20 - 2837.52] Spirit of compassion
[2835.72 - 2839.38] with tremendous amounts of details and
[2837.52 - 2841.18] information and
[2839.38 - 2844.50] so yeah
[2841.18 - 2844.50] it's it's interesting
[2845.68 - 2849.22] your heart serves as the compass for
[2847.90 - 2851.56] your actions
[2849.22 - 2854.50] guiding you to do the right thing when
[2851.56 - 2856.84] your soul becomes lost
[2854.50 - 2859.42] when our souls become lost we feel like
[2856.84 - 2862.12] we disconnected we feel like our soul is
[2859.42 - 2865.42] busted up and broken our heart serves as
[2862.12 - 2867.16] the compass for our actions it guides us
[2865.42 - 2869.32] to do the right thing when our soul
[2867.16 - 2871.96] becomes lost our heart matters in that
[2869.32 - 2873.94] situation your heart is also a safety
[2871.96 - 2876.04] net that can compensate for soul
[2873.94 - 2878.68] injuries that means when we get broken
[2876.04 - 2880.42] down so hard and we have really bad
[2878.68 - 2883.84] relationship or something happened in
[2880.42 - 2887.10] our life our heart
[2883.84 - 2887.10] stand strong
[2887.32 - 2892.42] this means you can have a tattered soul
[2889.60 - 2894.52] and a warm loving heart
[2892.42 - 2897.46] I can't tell you how many people that
[2894.52 - 2900.04] I've met that have tattered they've been
[2897.46 - 2902.56] tattered along the way but their heart
[2900.04 - 2904.84] is warm and their heart is loving and
[2902.56 - 2907.54] their heart is caring I've been through
[2904.84 - 2909.16] a lot in my life and I still care and I
[2907.54 - 2910.90] still want to help and I still care
[2909.16 - 2912.22] about people and love people and I know
[2910.90 - 2913.84] there's a whole bunch of people out
[2912.22 - 2917.32] there they've been through hell and back
[2913.84 - 2920.70] and they still have a heart that's warm
[2917.32 - 2920.70] and loving and they care
[2921.58 - 2927.10] when your soul suffers
[2923.82 - 2931.36] losses a strong heart will get you
[2927.10 - 2933.76] through with Selfless Love compassion
[2931.36 - 2937.92] and joy under the soul
[2933.76 - 2937.92] until your soul has managed to heal
[2938.26 - 2944.20] compassion is critical
[2941.50 - 2947.86] superficial love
[2944.20 - 2951.10] that's a matter of the Mind
[2947.86 - 2953.34] self Selfless Love that comes from the
[2951.10 - 2953.34] heart
[2954.94 - 2957.76] foreign
[2955.96 - 2959.32] you guys know about superficial love
[2957.76 - 2962.46] right
[2959.32 - 2962.46] it's a superficial love
[2962.68 - 2965.10] love
[2966.04 - 2969.06] is not
[2971.08 - 2975.90] absolute
[2972.70 - 2975.90] love is not
[2977.44 - 2984.12] everything
[2979.60 - 2984.12] unless compassion is attached to it
[2984.16 - 2987.70] that's why you can see somebody and
[2985.84 - 2989.50] they'll fall in love with someone
[2987.70 - 2991.60] and then they can fall out of love with
[2989.50 - 2994.18] someone like what was it
[2991.60 - 2997.00] was it just a change of heart a change
[2994.18 - 2998.68] of mind what was that how can you be so
[2997.00 - 3000.54] in love with someone
[2998.68 - 3003.02] so in love with them and then not love
[3000.54 - 3003.02] them anymore
[3004.08 - 3007.68] that means that love had no compassion
[3006.72 - 3009.84] in there
[3007.68 - 3012.12] it wasn't attached
[3009.84 - 3015.62] they were separated
[3012.12 - 3015.62] if you have love
[3016.26 - 3021.86] for someone
[3018.84 - 3021.86] and it's lost
[3022.38 - 3028.26] that means that the compassion is gone
[3025.56 - 3029.94] compassion is the glue to love love
[3028.26 - 3032.10] isn't enough
[3029.94 - 3033.72] you have to have compassion as the glue
[3032.10 - 3036.42] for love
[3033.72 - 3038.94] or love won't stand a chance love won't
[3036.42 - 3040.74] hang in there love won't even Last Love
[3038.94 - 3042.30] Won't Be Strong Enough Love is just an
[3040.74 - 3045.00] empty word
[3042.30 - 3047.70] love is a totally empty word if
[3045.00 - 3050.52] compassion isn't intertwined or attached
[3047.70 - 3052.62] or somehow involved if you don't have
[3050.52 - 3055.50] compassion involved if compassion's not
[3052.62 - 3057.74] part of love then love it's not strong
[3055.50 - 3057.74] enough
[3059.22 - 3062.82] because a tremendous amount of
[3060.72 - 3065.04] information in here the meditations that
[3062.82 - 3066.66] are in here waves on the beach I love
[3065.04 - 3069.00] that one I want to do something with
[3066.66 - 3070.92] that with you guys sometime I'm going to
[3069.00 - 3073.98] read a little bit about emotional detox
[3070.92 - 3075.54] right here this book whoa surrounded by
[3073.98 - 3077.76] trees
[3075.54 - 3079.62] the healing tools in the medical medium
[3077.76 - 3083.18] books blow my mind because they come
[3079.62 - 3083.18] from Spirit of compassion
[3084.30 - 3090.24] reading time with aw is the best
[3087.30 - 3093.72] right there on IG
[3090.24 - 3096.08] see Juliet says isn't everything just a
[3093.72 - 3096.08] lesson
[3097.14 - 3101.46] we try to learn from it so we don't get
[3099.42 - 3104.46] burned by that stove again
[3101.46 - 3106.68] but no everything's not just a lesson
[3104.46 - 3108.84] unfortunately it's not
[3106.68 - 3111.78] it's like
[3108.84 - 3114.68] you don't need your arm chopped off to
[3111.78 - 3114.68] teach you a lesson
[3114.96 - 3118.28] is that a lesson
[3118.56 - 3124.02] I know a lot of war vets
[3120.78 - 3127.38] that lost their legs
[3124.02 - 3130.38] um intertwined with a lot of vets
[3127.38 - 3132.86] right I have vets in my family the whole
[3130.38 - 3132.86] bit and
[3134.94 - 3138.72] losing both your legs is not there to
[3137.34 - 3141.12] teach you a lesson
[3138.72 - 3144.14] we can we can certainly try to grow from
[3141.12 - 3144.14] it and learn from it
[3145.86 - 3150.56] but it wasn't done on purpose to teach
[3147.84 - 3150.56] us a lesson
[3152.40 - 3158.30] child abuse isn't there to teach a child
[3155.64 - 3158.30] a lesson
[3160.62 - 3165.72] so yeah no things aren't there for a
[3163.08 - 3167.58] lesson that's not how it works
[3165.72 - 3169.62] we can try to grow we can try to better
[3167.58 - 3172.80] ourselves we can try to rise above it we
[3169.62 - 3175.74] can try to use tools rise above it
[3172.80 - 3177.48] but it wasn't there to teach a child a
[3175.74 - 3179.76] lesson child abuse and it wasn't there
[3177.48 - 3183.32] for for uh
[3179.76 - 3183.32] a soldier who's
[3184.14 - 3186.84] trying to do something good it wasn't
[3185.70 - 3190.34] there
[3186.84 - 3190.34] for the soldier to lose their legs
[3190.56 - 3195.68] being killed isn't a lesson either for
[3193.26 - 3195.68] us to learn
[3195.78 - 3199.56] abuse of any kind for someone isn't a
[3197.88 - 3201.12] lesson for us to learn we're not that's
[3199.56 - 3204.02] not a lesson we're not supposed to learn
[3201.12 - 3204.02] that as a lesson
[3204.18 - 3206.84] but it happens
[3208.92 - 3212.28] you guys I'm reading if you just got
[3210.60 - 3214.04] here reading out a medical meme do you
[3212.28 - 3217.56] have the revised and Expanded Edition
[3214.04 - 3220.82] because one thing I can say and I'm I
[3217.56 - 3220.82] can't help it I got to say it again
[3220.92 - 3225.12] because it's been said like a thousand
[3223.44 - 3226.50] times out there over the years to try to
[3225.12 - 3228.42] discredit
[3226.50 - 3230.76] the information
[3228.42 - 3232.80] when I hear someone say out there like
[3230.76 - 3235.38] an influence or something say that you
[3232.80 - 3238.14] can't get any emotional tools
[3235.38 - 3240.36] or emotional healing or emotional detox
[3238.14 - 3242.46] info for medical medium when the books
[3240.36 - 3244.26] are filled with them it just tells me
[3242.46 - 3246.30] that that influencer never read the
[3244.26 - 3248.04] books
[3246.30 - 3250.02] perfectly clear that they haven't read
[3248.04 - 3252.06] the books
[3250.02 - 3253.38] yeah
[3252.06 - 3257.88] I'm going to read a little bit into
[3253.38 - 3262.02] emotional detox right here lena111
[3257.88 - 3263.10] hi aw why do I feel I have no worth no
[3262.02 - 3265.86] value
[3263.10 - 3266.70] but there is a drive in me that makes me
[3265.86 - 3270.84] do
[3266.70 - 3272.94] that makes me try day in and day out to
[3270.84 - 3276.24] take care of myself maybe my soul is
[3272.94 - 3279.50] hurt but my will is strong your free
[3276.24 - 3279.50] will is extremely strong

[3293.52 - 3297.54] have a really strong Spirit that's
[3295.56 - 3299.04] different than your soul your soul can

[3303.84 - 3307.46] will get stronger too and heal
[3309.24 - 3313.92] Lorraine now says people try to
[3310.98 - 3315.42] rationalize bad stuff as it being a
[3313.92 - 3318.38] lesson
[3315.42 - 3318.38] I know they do
[3324.84 - 3329.46] and those are usually the people those
[3327.12 - 3331.98] are usually the people
[3329.46 - 3333.36] who try to deny that Darkness exists you
[3331.98 - 3335.28] know they're like there is no Darkness
[3333.36 - 3337.94] there is no bad in the world there's no
[3335.28 - 3337.94] bad in the world
[3339.18 - 3344.78] it's like what bubble are you in because
[3342.54 - 3347.16] there's plenty of bad in the world
[3344.78 - 3349.56] they're not it's not all lessons well
[3347.16 - 3351.54] it's all lessons and even people don't
[3349.56 - 3354.54] mean to be bad that do terrible things
[3351.54 - 3356.88] out there it's really a Learning lesson
[3354.54 - 3358.32] and we're all just it's all we're all
[3356.88 - 3360.06] just learning there's no evil in the
[3358.32 - 3363.56] world there's no darkness in the world
[3360.06 - 3363.56] there's only lessons in the world
[3364.56 - 3370.38] foreign
[3367.32 - 3373.26] totally inaccurate emotional detox
[3370.38 - 3377.04] there's a significant emotional aspect
[3373.26 - 3379.56] recovering from any injury or ailment
[3377.04 - 3382.08] so there's a significant emotional
[3379.56 - 3384.36] aspect to recovering from any kind of
[3382.08 - 3386.88] sickness especially mystery illness
[3384.36 - 3390.54] especially mystery illness where 10
[3386.88 - 3393.68] doctors 20 doctors no answers can't heal
[3390.54 - 3393.68] Bend through hell and back
[3394.02 - 3400.80] as your body cleanses itself of toxins
[3397.70 - 3403.80] and viruses and pathogens
[3400.80 - 3407.10] you may find that emotional detox occurs
[3403.80 - 3409.02] too when you are healing and you are
[3407.10 - 3411.30] cleaning up those bugs and cleaning up
[3409.02 - 3414.30] those toxins inside the body
[3411.30 - 3414.30] emotions
[3414.72 - 3419.36] and emotional detox occurs as well
[3417.78 - 3421.74] there's many people where they're
[3419.36 - 3423.78] simultaneously that emotional detox
[3421.74 - 3426.12] happening
[3423.78 - 3428.58] for example if you suffered with chronic
[3426.12 - 3430.98] fatigue syndrome since college and have
[3428.58 - 3433.26] learned through this book that a virus
[3430.98 - 3435.96] was behind your condition
[3433.26 - 3438.06] you might feel initial relief and even
[3435.96 - 3439.62] Elation as you follow the chapter's
[3438.06 - 3441.96] guidelines to restore yourself I can't
[3439.62 - 3444.18] tell you how many people I heard this
[3441.96 - 3446.64] over and over again for years now it's
[3444.18 - 3450.00] almost a decade with this book
[3446.64 - 3452.58] and oh my God I can't believe I know the
[3450.00 - 3454.92] answer to why I'm sick I feel like I can
[3452.58 - 3457.08] heal emotionally now I've been
[3454.92 - 3458.82] emotionally tortured because I have
[3457.08 - 3461.94] fatigue and brain fog and I can't
[3458.82 - 3463.98] function and I can't feed myself and
[3461.94 - 3465.96] take care of myself and work
[3463.98 - 3468.54] and everybody thinks I'm crazy and
[3465.96 - 3470.40] everybody thinks I'm lazy and that I'm
[3468.54 - 3472.26] making this up and I've been to so many
[3470.40 - 3475.08] doctors including this new Lyme doctor
[3472.26 - 3477.06] now and this other specialist
[3475.08 - 3479.28] I can't tell you how many people found
[3477.06 - 3481.38] this book and were like oh my God I am
[3479.28 - 3484.86] finding peace in my heart peace in my
[3481.38 - 3487.50] soul to have an answer to why I'm sick
[3484.86 - 3490.10] that alone is unbelievable when you

[3605.16 - 3611.40] not that it's not
[3608.58 - 3613.56] let's see here's a comment right here
[3611.40 - 3616.56] sometimes I think when you've been
[3613.56 - 3619.08] through tough times and come back and
[3616.56 - 3622.50] Rise From the Ashes your heart becomes
[3619.08 - 3625.04] bigger and same with your compassion
[3622.50 - 3625.04] thank you
[3629.10 - 3632.12] so here we go
[3635.52 - 3639.12] when you've had
[3637.74 - 3640.62] when you've had all these different
[3639.12 - 3643.56] trials
[3640.62 - 3646.32] you've been tested
[3643.56 - 3648.24] you've been pushed to the edge
[3646.32 - 3650.22] you've had so many symptoms in so many
[3648.24 - 3652.26] conditions
[3650.22 - 3654.90] you've been to every doctor and family
[3652.26 - 3658.02] and friends they don't even really trust
[3654.90 - 3659.76] any more that you're even legit as far
[3658.02 - 3662.34] as your symptoms where hey you're
[3659.76 - 3664.20] psychosomatic and you're a hypochondriac
[3662.34 - 3666.72] and this probably isn't even real
[3664.20 - 3669.00] anymore and you look good too like you
[3666.72 - 3671.16] look fine you fine you don't look like
[3669.00 - 3674.42] you're sick you look okay you look
[3671.16 - 3674.42] normal hey you look good today
[3674.78 - 3679.86] it hits it hits us really hard when that
[3677.94 - 3682.02] happens so we're just like
[3679.86 - 3683.88] especially if we're really suffering and
[3682.02 - 3685.62] struggling and it's getting worse and
[3683.88 - 3689.82] that's a whole nother level of like oh
[3685.62 - 3692.10] my God no one understands me
[3689.82 - 3694.50] and then you start healing you find the
[3692.10 - 3699.00] answers you rise out of the ashes
[3694.50 - 3700.26] whoa every single one of those remarks
[3699.00 - 3702.54] that you have gone through and that
[3700.26 - 3705.42] hardship you've gone through and people
[3702.54 - 3709.64] not people judging you and doubting you
[3705.42 - 3709.64] is like a building block
[3709.98 - 3715.50] you're building your church you're
[3713.28 - 3718.88] building your Sanctuary you're building
[3715.50 - 3718.88] your foundation
[3721.70 - 3727.80] says so we
[3724.68 - 3730.68] so do we need to extra protect our
[3727.80 - 3732.60] adrenals when this happens or is it just
[3730.68 - 3736.20] part of the detox process and I'm good
[3732.60 - 3739.52] and if if a crying spell happens
[3736.20 - 3739.52] the medical medium information
[3741.02 - 3748.74] is adrenal protective
[3745.14 - 3752.46] if you are cleansing and detoxing
[3748.74 - 3754.20] with a medical medium protocol
[3752.46 - 3757.88] it's protecting your adrenals because
[3754.20 - 3757.88] it's not stopping you from eating
[3758.58 - 3762.42] if you're going through a hardship
[3760.16 - 3763.86] emotionally and you're intermittent
[3762.42 - 3766.02] fasting your adrenals are not being
[3763.86 - 3767.94] protected
[3766.02 - 3770.16] but medical medium information isn't
[3767.94 - 3772.14] intermittent fasting
[3770.16 - 3774.78] if you're doing
[3772.14 - 3776.40] like a 369 or you're doing a 28 day
[3774.78 - 3777.72] cleanse or you're doing brain shot
[3776.40 - 3778.92] therapies or whatever it is that you're
[3777.72 - 3782.22] doing or
[3778.92 - 3784.56] the monocleanse or anything you're
[3782.22 - 3787.26] actually getting fuel to protect your
[3784.56 - 3789.12] adrenals
[3787.26 - 3790.74] and that's the problem so many people in
[3789.12 - 3792.84] e-better diets aren't even protecting
[3790.74 - 3796.88] their adrenals
[3792.84 - 3796.88] and so yeah of course it's okay to cry
[3799.86 - 3806.10] it's just it's just reliving old trauma
[3803.58 - 3807.78] is difficult like if
[3806.10 - 3810.60] if you
[3807.78 - 3813.12] if you feel you need to relive old
[3810.60 - 3815.64] trauma
[3813.12 - 3816.48] I'm not judging you I support you but if
[3815.64 - 3820.62] you
[3816.48 - 3822.72] but if you're reliving old trauma
[3820.62 - 3826.70] or reliving
[3822.72 - 3826.70] real fresh trauma
[3827.04 - 3832.02] it's important to fortify
[3829.68 - 3833.82] with for example like the medical meme
[3832.02 - 3836.28] information there's so much adrenal
[3833.82 - 3839.16] support in the books it's
[3836.28 - 3842.36] the books are partially built on
[3839.16 - 3842.36] supporting the adrenals
[3842.76 - 3847.58] the information from above is so adrenal
[3845.10 - 3847.58] protective
[3849.42 - 3852.96] when you're really sick with chronic
[3851.10 - 3856.32] illness and you're feeling very
[3852.96 - 3859.28] vulnerable it's it's not the right time
[3856.32 - 3862.56] to revisit some really really really
[3859.28 - 3864.90] deep-seated hurtful wounds I will say
[3862.56 - 3866.28] this when people go to therapists and I
[3864.90 - 3868.02] support people going to therapist of
[3866.28 - 3869.76] course but you know and everything but
[3868.02 - 3872.10] the point is when they go to therapists
[3869.76 - 3875.16] and they're very sick and nobody knows
[3872.10 - 3877.44] why they're sick with lupus and fibro
[3875.16 - 3879.06] and Ms and and so many different
[3877.44 - 3880.20] conditions that could list 100 of them
[3879.06 - 3882.24] right
[3880.20 - 3884.40] and they're very vulnerable and their
[3882.24 - 3888.08] immune systems are really really
[3884.40 - 3890.42] sensitive and low and they're reliving
[3888.08 - 3894.60] serious serious
[3890.42 - 3896.88] emotional turmoil and Trauma
[3894.60 - 3898.74] it's very difficult because the person's
[3896.88 - 3901.56] already struggling and really really
[3898.74 - 3904.20] sick so it's best to get the physical
[3901.56 - 3908.48] body stronger so you can eventually then
[3904.20 - 3908.48] tackle some of that old trauma
[3911.70 - 3917.70] I think where people get it wrong a lot
[3914.40 - 3919.38] or they get get it wrong right
[3917.70 - 3922.44] because they think that they need to
[3919.38 - 3925.26] like say they're say they're doing
[3922.44 - 3927.78] like a low-fat protocol where they're
[3925.26 - 3929.40] keeping the fats really low
[3927.78 - 3931.80] and
[3929.40 - 3933.36] they think well I better eat more fat to
[3931.80 - 3935.76] withhold
[3933.36 - 3937.92] you know to protect my adrenals
[3935.76 - 3939.30] but it doesn't work that way the more
[3937.92 - 3941.52] fat you eat
[3939.30 - 3942.84] the more you stress the adrenals out the
[3941.52 - 3944.34] one thing I think where people don't
[3942.84 - 3947.18] understand about medical medium
[3944.34 - 3951.78] information is that when you're doing
[3947.18 - 3954.00] like the 28 day cleanse the 369s and the
[3951.78 - 3955.98] mono cleanses and the morning cleanses
[3954.00 - 3958.50] and you're doing all the different
[3955.98 - 3960.96] right you're doing all the different
[3958.50 - 3963.12] food protocols
[3960.96 - 3964.68] what people don't realize is that your
[3963.12 - 3968.16] adrenals start building up and getting
[3964.68 - 3970.44] stronger and stronger and stronger
[3968.16 - 3974.70] so the one thing about Spirit of
[3970.44 - 3977.04] compassions information for the foods
[3974.70 - 3980.42] and the food protocols with medical
[3977.04 - 3984.00] medium is that it builds the adrenals
[3980.42 - 3986.64] stronger and stronger without wearing
[3984.00 - 3989.64] them down it's part of how people get
[3986.64 - 3992.52] their lives back and then
[3989.64 - 3994.20] and then as they're healing their
[3992.52 - 3996.90] adrenals
[3994.20 - 4000.14] and they bring in a shift in their diet
[3996.90 - 4003.44] like they start eating all this fun food
[4000.14 - 4004.40] and really heavy vegan food lots of fats
[4003.44 - 4005.90] or whatever it is and they start
[4004.40 - 4008.18] bringing all that in they feel better
[4005.90 - 4010.46] for a moment because they made their
[4008.18 - 4012.56] adrenals so strong
[4010.46 - 4014.24] that the minute they started eating all
[4012.56 - 4015.98] these like say they brought in all these
[4014.24 - 4017.36] burritos and all this was just fun but
[4015.98 - 4019.40] they brought in all this fat and they
[4017.36 - 4021.92] brought in all this and the bagels and
[4019.40 - 4023.24] they brought in the vegan pizza and they
[4021.92 - 4025.16] brought all that in
[4023.24 - 4027.92] and they're like oh my God I can eat
[4025.16 - 4030.20] what I want and I'm feeling better from
[4027.92 - 4033.68] it what they're feeling is the strength
[4030.20 - 4036.20] of the adrenals that they restored on
[4033.68 - 4038.12] the medical medium protocols so what the
[4036.20 - 4040.82] medical medium protocols do
[4038.12 - 4042.86] is they restore and strengthen adrenals
[4040.82 - 4045.20] to such a point that the minute you
[4042.86 - 4048.26] start to use your adrenaline you
[4045.20 - 4050.90] self-medicate you feel like
[4048.26 - 4053.90] like oh my God I feel incredible you
[4050.90 - 4056.66] feel the hit from the adrenaline because
[4053.90 - 4058.76] you brought your adrenals back so people
[4056.66 - 4061.76] come to Medical medium information with
[4058.76 - 4063.38] weak adrenals they come to mm info with
[4061.76 - 4065.84] weakened broken down adrenals from
[4063.38 - 4068.00] intermittent fasting from Bad eat better
[4065.84 - 4070.82] diets from dysfunctional eat better
[4068.00 - 4072.68] diets from keto diets from carnivore
[4070.82 - 4075.44] diets they come to Medical medium
[4072.68 - 4078.44] information and diet and medical medium
[4075.44 - 4082.34] food protocols they come here with
[4078.44 - 4084.26] broken adrenals and then they they start
[4082.34 - 4087.38] to restore them with the celery juice
[4084.26 - 4090.26] and the eating every couple of hours and
[4087.38 - 4092.72] the fruits and the leafy greens and they
[4090.26 - 4094.76] start to restore their adrenals and
[4092.72 - 4097.52] after a year they finally got their
[4094.76 - 4100.04] adrenals so much stronger
[4097.52 - 4101.54] that all of a sudden they feel like they
[4100.04 - 4103.76] could eat other things so they start
[4101.54 - 4105.38] bringing in other stuff and more fat and
[4103.76 - 4107.36] higher fat and more things and the
[4105.38 - 4112.16] minute they start bringing all that in
[4107.36 - 4115.78] it proves itself the adrenals are so
[4112.16 - 4118.48] strong at that point that they release
[4115.78 - 4121.22] self-medication they release
[4118.48 - 4125.20] adrenaline hits and then all of a sudden
[4121.22 - 4125.20] you feel euphoric like wait a minute
[4125.60 - 4131.48] I feel better now that I'm eating three
[4128.42 - 4134.12] slices of vegan pizza and I'm eating two
[4131.48 - 4136.40] avocados every day and I'm eating
[4134.12 - 4137.84] whatever I feel better and I'm eating
[4136.40 - 4139.88] more chicken or something or whatever
[4137.84 - 4142.16] they're doing or chocolate
[4139.88 - 4143.90] and they're like wait a minute I feel
[4142.16 - 4145.10] better and then all of a sudden someone
[4143.90 - 4146.96] will put something in their head and go
[4145.10 - 4149.60] like oh you were orthorexic before
[4146.96 - 4151.76] meanwhile what you were restoring your
[4149.60 - 4154.58] adrenals you were bringing yourself back
[4151.76 - 4156.74] you were you were blowing lowering your
[4154.58 - 4158.66] inflammation
[4156.74 - 4161.30] and then
[4158.66 - 4163.34] even if you weren't totally fully hail
[4161.30 - 4165.62] healed yet and you still had some
[4163.34 - 4167.18] problems like a knee problem that
[4165.62 - 4169.22] wouldn't quite get to where it needed to
[4167.18 - 4171.20] go or an ankle problem that wasn't quite
[4169.22 - 4174.32] there the minute you started bringing in
[4171.20 - 4177.62] all that fat or bringing in other Foods
[4174.32 - 4180.50] your adrenals were so strong from doing
[4177.62 - 4183.74] mm stuff even if you're just doing it on
[4180.50 - 4185.54] and off it made them so strong that the
[4183.74 - 4188.18] minute you brought in some fat your
[4185.54 - 4190.18] adrenals were like and just released all
[4188.18 - 4192.14] this adrenaline and it became
[4190.18 - 4193.82] self-medication where all of a sudden
[4192.14 - 4195.20] you're just like whoa it was like bee
[4193.82 - 4198.20] sting therapy
[4195.20 - 4200.66] but the difference is you you know your
[4198.20 - 4203.54] adrenals just got so strong and healthy
[4200.66 - 4205.76] that you you can afford to just blow out
[4203.54 - 4207.86] a bunch of adrenaline that's that's
[4205.76 - 4209.54] what's incredible about the mm info I
[4207.86 - 4211.64] know this is really
[4209.54 - 4213.92] detailed information there's so much
[4211.64 - 4215.66] more I can say about it but I think
[4213.92 - 4217.40] that's a mistake people make they don't
[4215.66 - 4220.70] realize it like for instance I remember
[4217.40 - 4222.56] a couple years ago
[4220.70 - 4224.24] right
[4222.56 - 4226.04] um someone
[4224.24 - 4229.46] I remember this one and I see it a lot
[4226.04 - 4231.68] right but someone restored
[4229.46 - 4233.78] their health
[4231.68 - 4235.94] by doing the mono eating the medical
[4233.78 - 4237.68] media monocleens
[4235.94 - 4239.36] and they got the medical media
[4237.68 - 4241.40] monocleanse from the cleanse the heel
[4239.36 - 4243.50] book right I don't know I think I have
[4241.40 - 4244.82] it somewhere the Clinton Hill book and
[4243.50 - 4246.56] the restored
[4244.82 - 4249.20] their
[4246.56 - 4250.70] their health
[4249.20 - 4252.56] but they did it because they were doing
[4250.70 - 4254.78] the medical media monocleanse and they
[4252.56 - 4256.76] restored their adrenals and they've got
[4254.78 - 4259.16] their inflammation down and they lowered
[4256.76 - 4261.38] their viral load and then
[4259.16 - 4264.38] they
[4261.38 - 4266.18] said hey I'm gonna go and just eat
[4264.38 - 4267.68] whatever but good vegan food but I'm
[4266.18 - 4269.42] gonna go eat a whole bunch of good vegan
[4267.68 - 4270.86] food and they went and they had all this
[4269.42 - 4272.42] vegan food and they were eating all
[4270.86 - 4274.10] kinds of dishes and delights and going
[4272.42 - 4277.18] out to dinner
[4274.10 - 4280.28] and they felt great like better because
[4277.18 - 4282.14] they restored their adrenals for a
[4280.28 - 4284.66] couple of years
[4282.14 - 4288.70] and then they started using their
[4284.66 - 4288.70] adrenaline and man did it feel good
[4289.58 - 4293.84] that's how it works cold White Springs
[4292.04 - 4296.72] says fat triggers adrenals yes fat
[4293.84 - 4298.34] triggers adrenaline correct because the
[4296.72 - 4302.12] more fat you put into your bloodstream
[4298.34 - 4304.64] your hearts your heart struggles
[4302.12 - 4306.56] so
[4304.64 - 4308.30] you know so what happens is the more fat
[4306.56 - 4310.34] that's why vegans get sick they're
[4308.30 - 4312.56] eating nut Butters just so much coconut
[4310.34 - 4314.96] oil and and almond butter and they're
[4312.56 - 4316.58] eating so much it's okay to have some of
[4314.96 - 4318.26] that if if you want to have some but
[4316.58 - 4322.28] what happens is that in when people
[4318.26 - 4324.80] become vegan they end up eating so much
[4322.28 - 4327.38] vegan cheese which is pure this is pure
[4324.80 - 4329.84] fat they end up eating vegan cheese and
[4327.38 - 4332.18] coconut oil and they end up eating a lot
[4329.84 - 4334.22] of it and cocoa butter coconut I mean
[4332.18 - 4337.16] sorry cacao butter right they end up
[4334.22 - 4338.66] eating cacao and chocolate more of it so
[4337.16 - 4341.06] when you're vegan you're like oh I can
[4338.66 - 4343.04] eat I'm not going to eat meat or chicken
[4341.06 - 4345.38] I'm not gonna have fish I'm vegan now
[4343.04 - 4346.64] but I can have more chocolate incredible
[4345.38 - 4348.32] and chocolate's supposed to be good for
[4346.64 - 4350.54] me I'll have more chocolate so they'll
[4348.32 - 4353.30] do that and then they'll do
[4350.54 - 4355.04] then they'll do like more coconut oil
[4353.30 - 4356.90] and they're putting like coconut oil on
[4355.04 - 4358.58] everything and they're using olive oil
[4356.90 - 4360.26] on everything and then not only are they
[4358.58 - 4362.30] doing olive oil they're eating more
[4360.26 - 4363.32] avocados than they ever did before and
[4362.30 - 4364.70] then
[4363.32 - 4366.56] they were feeling a little better from
[4364.70 - 4368.30] the start because they got off of their
[4366.56 - 4370.88] their processed food diet or whatever
[4368.30 - 4373.04] they're doing and then they get sicker
[4370.88 - 4375.26] and now they're back on eggs
[4373.04 - 4376.88] they're vegans that go back on eggs and
[4375.26 - 4379.06] every like they're they're not vegan
[4376.88 - 4379.06] anymore
[4379.10 - 4383.36] and people also heal so many other
[4381.20 - 4385.28] things on medical medium
[4383.36 - 4388.22] and the adrenals
[4385.28 - 4390.62] you know give you a high once you drop
[4388.22 - 4393.14] that fat in so here you go you're on
[4390.62 - 4395.00] medical Medium you're healing your Ms
[4393.14 - 4396.80] your lupus your Lyme disease your
[4395.00 - 4398.90] healing your tingles numbness vertigo
[4396.80 - 4401.12] aches and pains you're healing your
[4398.90 - 4403.22] restless leg syndrome you're healing all
[4401.12 - 4405.80] these conditions your eczemas your
[4403.22 - 4407.66] psoriasis and now you go and you you
[4405.80 - 4409.04] blow up your diet with a whole bunch of
[4407.66 - 4412.10] fat in there
[4409.04 - 4414.50] and then you get a high for a little
[4412.10 - 4417.80] while like whoa
[4414.50 - 4419.60] like and that high is adrenaline surging
[4417.80 - 4422.18] through your bloodstream and that stuff
[4419.60 - 4424.82] can medicate you people don't realize it
[4422.18 - 4426.82] but our adrenaline could medicate us
[4424.82 - 4430.70] like our adrenals are just like
[4426.82 - 4433.22] squeezing out that gasoline that that
[4430.70 - 4435.64] fuel
[4433.22 - 4440.74] the kerosene and it's like and it's it's
[4435.64 - 4440.74] igniting and we are on adrenaline
[4441.08 - 4445.04] I don't know how we got into an adrenal
[4442.94 - 4448.58] talk adrenaline to oh a question to
[4445.04 - 4450.86] happen Renata Renata
[4448.58 - 4453.44] so to clarify here's your question right
[4450.86 - 4456.14] you're on YouTube so to clarify if we
[4453.44 - 4458.48] need to cry should we go ahead and do it
[4456.14 - 4460.40] without worrying about our adrenals or
[4458.48 - 4462.50] possible adrenaline surges
[4460.40 - 4464.00] that could feed viruses if you have to
[4462.50 - 4465.62] cry if you feel like you need to cry you
[4464.00 - 4467.06] can cry I mean
[4465.62 - 4468.62] you're taking care of yourself you're
[4467.06 - 4470.48] doing you're doing the medical mean
[4468.62 - 4472.46] protocols you're you're strengthening
[4470.48 - 4474.14] your adrenals like you do and all that
[4472.46 - 4477.02] you do that you've done throughout the
[4474.14 - 4479.00] process right all of it
[4477.02 - 4481.90] if you have to let out some tears let
[4479.00 - 4481.90] out some tears
[4489.14 - 4491.32] foreign
[4494.84 - 4500.62] so I want to read about this little part
[4496.88 - 4500.62] right here which is really powerful too
[4500.84 - 4503.26] so
[4503.42 - 4509.18] as our cells release those physical
[4506.48 - 4511.28] toxins such as neurotoxins and
[4509.18 - 4513.10] dermatoxins produced by the very viruses
[4511.28 - 4516.68] behind your symptoms and conditions
[4513.10 - 4519.98] emotions bubble up
[4516.68 - 4522.02] you may find yourself angry with the
[4519.98 - 4523.94] people who told you your illness was
[4522.02 - 4525.74] psychosomatic we talked about that and
[4523.94 - 4530.44] you may grieve for the years you lost
[4525.74 - 4530.44] about being unwell so many people grieve
[4530.96 - 4537.08] so fernica Monica says self-medicated
[4533.54 - 4540.14] adrenaline is then good
[4537.08 - 4543.02] using too much of it's not good it's
[4540.14 - 4544.94] like you restored your adrenals that's
[4543.02 - 4547.16] what medical mean information is always
[4544.94 - 4549.44] done for people going back decades it
[4547.16 - 4551.18] restores their adrenals makes them
[4549.44 - 4554.54] really strong
[4551.18 - 4556.16] and then we self-medicate all over again
[4554.54 - 4558.08] like I can't tell you how many times
[4556.16 - 4560.54] like you got to read the brain saver
[4558.08 - 4563.74] books you guys uh the eating disorder
[4560.54 - 4566.42] chapter alone is like
[4563.74 - 4567.92] mind-blowing right and it talks about
[4566.42 - 4569.54] adrenaline and stuff like that right
[4567.92 - 4573.56] I've helped so many people that have had
[4569.54 - 4575.60] like bulimia right and they were just on
[4573.56 - 4577.96] adrenaline highs that's what bulimia is
[4575.60 - 4580.76] it's an adrenaline High
[4577.96 - 4582.92] and um
[4580.76 - 4584.78] and they had to restore using so many
[4582.92 - 4587.96] people that were bulimic had to use
[4584.78 - 4590.66] medical medium info and to restore their
[4587.96 - 4593.54] adrenals again
[4590.66 - 4596.18] and then if they ever go back to bulimia
[4593.54 - 4598.64] like a trigger happens right a severe
[4596.18 - 4601.46] emotional abuse and they go back to
[4598.64 - 4604.58] bulimia
[4601.46 - 4607.34] it's euphoric because they restored
[4604.58 - 4608.90] their adrenals again what happens is
[4607.34 - 4611.60] there's this thing what happens is when
[4608.90 - 4613.82] your bulimic you run out of adrenaline
[4611.60 - 4615.68] as the years go by because you're using
[4613.82 - 4618.50] it to propel and vomit the food up right
[4615.68 - 4620.60] but what's happening is that then you
[4618.50 - 4624.20] don't get high anymore
[4620.60 - 4626.72] but when you restore your adrenals
[4624.20 - 4629.48] it's like it's Euphoria when you restore
[4626.72 - 4634.10] your adrenals and you eat whatever you
[4629.48 - 4636.14] want it's euphoric because your adrenals
[4634.10 - 4638.12] got so strong they're
[4636.14 - 4640.46] peeing out adrenaline and it's
[4638.12 - 4643.28] self-medication so you so yeah you got
[4640.46 - 4647.12] to be careful like you don't like overdo
[4643.28 - 4649.88] your your well you actually created a
[4647.12 - 4651.98] Wellspring of adrenaline to protect you
[4649.88 - 4654.94] to have you live longer you don't want
[4651.98 - 4654.94] to blow it all out
[4658.52 - 4661.82] how his health said just made this live
[4660.44 - 4663.74] we talked about a lot of things you got
[4661.82 - 4665.66] to watch from the beginning and I think
[4663.74 - 4667.70] right isn't that funny like it's like
[4665.66 - 4670.36] but I'm glad you're here thank you Holly
[4667.70 - 4670.36] for being here
[4671.30 - 4674.96] yeah think about that I'm listening to
[4673.58 - 4676.64] Spirit of compassion right here so just
[4674.96 - 4678.62] bear with me I'll just
[4676.64 - 4681.64] I'm mumbling a little bit and listening
[4678.62 - 4681.64] Spirit of compassion
[4682.58 - 4686.60] Veronica says how would you how will how
[4684.86 - 4688.28] will you know that your adrenals are
[4686.60 - 4689.72] strong after being bedridden for almost
[4688.28 - 4691.94] two years
[4689.72 - 4694.88] what happens is that your adrenals could
[4691.94 - 4697.76] get really strong while you're bedridden
[4694.88 - 4700.10] and your bedridden for other reasons
[4697.76 - 4701.30] right so someone could be bedridden for
[4700.10 - 4703.10] other reasons like in the medical meme
[4701.30 - 4704.60] books talks about so you can be
[4703.10 - 4706.82] bedridden for another reason but your
[4704.60 - 4709.60] adrenals could still get stronger
[4706.82 - 4709.60] and stronger
[4710.84 - 4715.82] the one thing about since I was younger
[4713.24 - 4717.50] that Spirit of compassion
[4715.82 - 4720.26] taught me to help people and message
[4717.50 - 4722.06] people like taught me so I could be the
[4720.26 - 4724.94] messenger
[4722.06 - 4726.74] was how to restorage renals
[4724.94 - 4729.50] I think one of the things when I see
[4726.74 - 4731.60] someone say something like you know
[4729.50 - 4733.58] medical medium doesn't address the
[4731.60 - 4735.62] adrenaline or so are you kidding oh my
[4733.58 - 4737.12] God the books are there's so much
[4735.62 - 4740.12] adrenal information in these books I
[4737.12 - 4741.98] almost I almost can't when Spirit of
[4740.12 - 4744.92] compassion just keeps on giving me more
[4741.98 - 4746.78] information about adrenals and I have to
[4744.92 - 4748.82] write it down I almost can't handle it
[4746.78 - 4750.62] anymore because I'm like oh my God
[4748.82 - 4753.76] there's so much information about
[4750.62 - 4753.76] adrenals in these books
[4763.28 - 4767.18] here's here's what I look here's here's
[4765.92 - 4768.44] the when someone goes through a lot of
[4767.18 - 4770.08] trauma and they go through a lot of
[4768.44 - 4772.46] hardship and they've been really hurt
[4770.08 - 4775.28] emotionally they've been hurt they've
[4772.46 - 4777.14] gone through a lot I'd like to I know
[4775.28 - 4780.14] that a lot of people that they will use
[4777.14 - 4782.84] crying as a release they will use crying
[4780.14 - 4784.10] as a release okay and
[4782.84 - 4787.22] um
[4784.10 - 4789.76] uh but what happens is you know the
[4787.22 - 4792.98] bottom line and that can if you feel
[4789.76 - 4795.34] compelled to cry you can cry but what I
[4792.98 - 4795.34] love about
[4795.38 - 4798.86] What Spirit of compassion puts inside
[4797.18 - 4801.38] these books
[4798.86 - 4803.42] like

[4895.40 - 4899.66] certain reasons why you do that work and
[4898.16 - 4903.10] so many other things that I'm not even
[4899.66 - 4906.98] mentioning right you work for a paycheck
[4903.10 - 4909.74] benefits to support your family to serve
[4906.98 - 4912.32] your clients to please your boss
[4909.74 - 4914.24] that's the part everyone knows that's
[4912.32 - 4915.80] why we work right that's the part
[4914.24 - 4917.84] everybody knows
[4915.80 - 4921.32] if your job feels like a burden though
[4917.84 - 4923.60] if you have a demeaning supervisor or a
[4921.32 - 4926.36] grueling schedule if you feel like your
[4923.60 - 4927.98] work has no meaning or no one
[4926.36 - 4931.40] appreciates you
[4927.98 - 4934.10] if you if the inspiration or passion for
[4931.40 - 4936.44] what you do is disappearing and you feel
[4934.10 - 4940.34] lost then it's time to shift your
[4936.44 - 4945.20] mindset no matter what you do no matter
[4940.34 - 4948.28] where you do it you work for God
[4945.20 - 4948.28] you work for God
[4950.42 - 4955.40] repeat this aloud
[4953.30 - 4958.46] using whatever term feels most
[4955.40 - 4962.18] comfortable for you each day connect to
[4958.46 - 4964.16] it and everything will change
[4962.18 - 4968.60] when you wake up in the morning and open
[4964.16 - 4971.54] your eyes or sit up in bed open the door
[4968.60 - 4975.04] to the day and say it
[4971.54 - 4975.04] I work for God
[4976.10 - 4980.42] and if
[4977.78 - 4983.00] if you don't believe in God then maybe
[4980.42 - 4986.96] something else fits in
[4983.00 - 4989.12] like I work for the higher source
[4986.96 - 4990.50] if that doesn't work for you I work for
[4989.12 - 4993.68] the light

[5471.88 - 5475.42] information Holly's Health aw is it
[5474.16 - 5478.18] normal to feel different on the
[5475.42 - 5479.62] different days after the light blast yes
[5478.18 - 5483.88] it is everybody has a different
[5479.62 - 5485.86] experience it's so some people days
[5483.88 - 5487.18] later like tomorrow they're going to be
[5485.86 - 5489.22] doing a whole bunch of different stuff
[5487.18 - 5491.56] it it's
[5489.22 - 5493.78] it's like time release
[5491.56 - 5495.10] what's incredible I didn't tell you guys
[5493.78 - 5496.42] and I'm going to talk about it on the
[5495.10 - 5499.84] next light blast
[5496.42 - 5501.64] and I forgot to talk about it
[5499.84 - 5503.02] um I forgot to talk about it on the
[5501.64 - 5505.72] light blast
[5503.02 - 5508.06] uh live we just did right just talking
[5505.72 - 5509.08] about it and all that
[5508.06 - 5510.58] but
[5509.08 - 5512.74] you have to remember what's happening
[5510.58 - 5515.26] with the light and where it's coming
[5512.74 - 5517.42] from it's coming from far away
[5515.26 - 5519.58] but it's breaking time and space so
[5517.42 - 5522.46] what's happening is that light is coming
[5519.58 - 5525.30] it's traveling through time it's it's
[5522.46 - 5528.90] literally
[5525.30 - 5528.90] beating time itself
[5528.94 - 5534.64] and what's incredible about that light
[5531.88 - 5536.74] is because that's not light like from
[5534.64 - 5538.18] you look in the sky and there's the sun
[5536.74 - 5540.82] right
[5538.18 - 5542.02] and the Sun is this ball of fire and gas
[5540.82 - 5543.52] right
[5542.02 - 5546.28] and so
[5543.52 - 5547.84] that sun is a physical light like that
[5546.28 - 5549.40] right it's just up there and it's just
[5547.84 - 5551.20] burning
[5549.40 - 5553.26] the light from the light blast is an
[5551.20 - 5555.94] entirely different light and it's just
[5553.26 - 5558.88] crushing time and space
[5555.94 - 5561.46] to get here like it does from God it's
[5558.88 - 5564.52] just unbelievable
[5561.46 - 5567.12] the power in it is just mind-blowing
