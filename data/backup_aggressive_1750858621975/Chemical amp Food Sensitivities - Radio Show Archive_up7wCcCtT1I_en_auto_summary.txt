==================================================

In this episode, Anthony William, the Medical Medium, discusses the rising issue of chemical sensitivities and chronic illnesses that are often misunderstood or overlooked by conventional medicine. He emphasizes the importance of compassion towards those suffering from these conditions and highlights the role of the liver in managing toxins and sensitivities. William argues that many people are misled into thinking their symptoms are psychological or self-inflicted, rather than acknowledging the biological and environmental factors at play.
