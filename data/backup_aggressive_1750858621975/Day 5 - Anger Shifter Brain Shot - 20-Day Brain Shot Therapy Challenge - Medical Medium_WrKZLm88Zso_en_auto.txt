[0.00 - 6.84] what happens in our brain when we get
[3.12 - 7.74] angry what goes wrong inside of our
[6.84 - 9.36] brain
[7.74 - 10.98] when we get mad
[9.36 - 14.28] we get upset
[10.98 - 16.80] and we get angry or we even hold that
[14.28 - 20.10] anger out it's not like we want to hold
[16.80 - 22.20] that anger out we don't want to be angry
[20.10 - 24.78] you don't want to be angry do you know
[22.20 - 27.54] anybody that wants to be angry where you
[24.78 - 30.42] want to be angry and you want to stay
[27.54 - 32.46] angry no way right
[30.42 - 35.88] because people don't want to be
[32.46 - 38.52] naturally angry on any level do they
[35.88 - 41.34] we're talking about the anger shifter
[38.52 - 45.00] this is day five of the medical medium
[41.34 - 47.28] brain shot therapy cleanse Challenge and
[45.00 - 50.88] I really like the anger shifter because
[47.28 - 52.98] if you've been betrayed or Something's
[50.88 - 55.76] Happened where you've just gotten really
[52.98 - 58.08] mad maybe you're dealing with
[55.76 - 60.12] emotions and they come up and they
[58.08 - 62.82] Bumble up and they they Bubble Up and
[60.12 - 64.62] you get mad anyway you get upset anyway
[62.82 - 66.78] and you feel like it's out of your
[64.62 - 68.64] control the anger shifter is a great
[66.78 - 70.26] tool so this is a medical medium tool
[68.64 - 71.88] this is day five of the brain shot
[70.26 - 73.44] therapy cleanse challenge we're doing
[71.88 - 75.42] the anger shifter today but I'm going to
[73.44 - 77.16] read about what happens inside of our
[75.42 - 81.00] brain when we get angry what happens
[77.16 - 82.98] inside of our head when we get angry
[81.00 - 85.50] so it's really important information
[82.98 - 87.24] critical information to anyone who's
[85.50 - 89.34] struggling with some kind of mood
[87.24 - 91.46] disorder too where you're getting pissed
[89.34 - 94.92] off and angry all the time or frustrated
[91.46 - 96.72] constantly frustrated or maybe you're
[94.92 - 98.64] trying to beat out that frustration and
[96.72 - 100.32] anger and you're moving along okay and
[98.64 - 102.36] then someone trips you up and you get
[100.32 - 104.76] triggered that's another thing too
[102.36 - 105.66] everybody seems to be getting triggered
[104.76 - 107.58] now
[105.66 - 109.32] and getting triggered along the way and
[107.58 - 111.42] that's interfering with them so they're
[109.32 - 113.16] getting angry because they're triggered
[111.42 - 115.56] and they get triggered into the anger
[113.16 - 117.48] then the anger makes them more triggered
[115.56 - 119.04] then the triggered makes them more angry
[117.48 - 120.60] and now they're in a vicious cycle and
[119.04 - 122.52] they can't get out of it and it's like
[120.60 - 125.88] how do I break this anger how do I break
[122.52 - 128.22] this anger or what if you got OCD
[125.88 - 130.56] OCD is a whole other thing if you're
[128.22 - 132.84] struggling with obsessive thoughts and
[130.56 - 135.24] you can't break them and it's making you
[132.84 - 138.24] angrier and more frustrated and more
[135.24 - 140.70] upset and what happens there right
[138.24 - 142.34] that's a whole other problem too so many
[140.70 - 146.82] people have
[142.34 - 148.68] OCD and it becomes a vicious cycle where
[146.82 - 151.26] it's like it's over and over again it's
[148.68 - 153.24] like you got the obsessive thoughts you
[151.26 - 154.74] can't stop the obsessive thoughts you
[153.24 - 156.12] know you need to stop them so you can
[154.74 - 157.92] have some peace in your heart for the
[156.12 - 160.08] moment peace in your mind and then you
[157.92 - 162.60] get upset because you can't stop them
[160.08 - 164.46] and then you're angry and then it's bet
[162.60 - 166.74] it's like it's getting triggered and
[164.46 - 170.34] it's Recycling and it's this Catch-22
[166.74 - 173.04] right so many people struggle with anger
[170.34 - 175.68] in so many ways and so many different
[173.04 - 176.82] having different complications with it
[175.68 - 178.80] too so I'm going to talk about what
[176.82 - 181.38] happens inside this brain right here
[178.80 - 183.96] your brain our brain
[181.38 - 186.18] what happens in the brain when we get
[183.96 - 188.58] angry I'm going to read about that we're
[186.18 - 189.84] going to do the anger shifter too so
[188.58 - 194.16] let's get into it now let's start
[189.84 - 199.28] reading about it let's roll into it
[194.16 - 199.28] so I'm going to go to page 30 I think
[199.38 - 205.44] I am looking for page 30. there we are
[202.38 - 206.88] page 31 right here brain saver you guys
[205.44 - 208.74] this is going to be really important
[206.88 - 211.20] information imperative information for
[208.74 - 212.76] anybody who's struggling or suffering
[211.20 - 217.92] with
[212.76 - 220.50] chronic mystery anger or anger bouts or
[217.92 - 223.38] frustration bouts or maybe you're
[220.50 - 225.18] depressed and the anger hits when you've
[223.38 - 227.04] been depressed for a while
[225.18 - 229.38] and then you have that burst of anger
[227.04 - 231.06] and then you cry and then now you're
[229.38 - 233.10] depressed again
[231.06 - 235.56] and then you're angry the next day and
[233.10 - 238.62] it keeps on going so many people have
[235.56 - 240.78] this issue so many people are struggling
[238.62 - 243.06] so there's a section in brain saver
[240.78 - 246.36] called melting down
[243.06 - 249.54] and it's page 30 right here I really
[246.36 - 251.10] need the anger shifter today actually I
[249.54 - 253.02] would love to have the anger shifter
[251.10 - 254.52] today that'd be fantastic
[253.02 - 255.96] there's people out there that are
[254.52 - 260.58] struggling with
[255.96 - 263.52] Untold unbalanced Untold unknown bouts
[260.58 - 265.98] of mystery anger at different times of
[263.52 - 268.68] of the day different times of the week
[265.98 - 271.02] the month for so many and this is so
[268.68 - 273.42] helpful let's talk about melting down
[271.02 - 275.70] what does that mean melting down
[273.42 - 276.66] it's a meltdown right we're having a
[275.70 - 280.22] meltdown
[276.66 - 280.22] when our brains get hot
[280.98 - 284.58] and there's metal involved I'm talking
[283.02 - 286.74] about toxic heavy metals a little bit
[284.58 - 289.38] because this is important
[286.74 - 291.30] because so many people you can be angry
[289.38 - 293.46] and frustrated not have toxic heavy
[291.30 - 295.44] metals inside the brain but so many
[293.46 - 296.52] people do have toxic heavy metals inside
[295.44 - 298.14] the brain
[296.52 - 300.06] they really do this is Advanced
[298.14 - 302.10] information it's Unique information from
[300.06 - 306.48] above just so you know it's in the brain
[302.10 - 309.18] saver books published here first
[306.48 - 311.52] it's incredible info when our brains get
[309.18 - 313.98] hot and there's metal involved the toxic
[311.52 - 315.60] heavy metal particles break down
[313.98 - 317.10] think about that
[315.60 - 319.26] how incredible that piece of information
[317.10 - 321.72] is since research doesn't know that
[319.26 - 324.42] alternative medicine doesn't know that
[321.72 - 327.90] when our brains get hot
[324.42 - 330.02] and there's metal involved the toxic
[327.90 - 332.58] heavy metal particles
[330.02 - 337.14] yacto particles
[332.58 - 338.94] the tiny particles nanoparticles
[337.14 - 341.52] break down
[338.94 - 343.80] the metals melt
[341.52 - 344.94] did you hear that you guys the metals
[343.80 - 348.54] melt
[344.94 - 350.94] these tiny nanoparticles septoparticles
[348.54 - 353.46] the active particles whatever these tiny
[350.94 - 356.58] particles melt
[353.46 - 360.60] every time a brain gets hot
[356.58 - 363.18] the metals melt inside of our brain
[360.60 - 365.22] toxic heavy metals in the brain get wear
[363.18 - 367.50] and tear
[365.22 - 368.76] when electrical currents are entering
[367.50 - 370.98] them
[368.76 - 373.74] all the electricity in your brain you
[370.98 - 377.52] guys has to hit
[373.74 - 381.00] every bit of metal that's in our brain
[377.52 - 382.74] Mercury copper lead arsenic
[381.00 - 386.28] aluminum
[382.74 - 389.70] cadmium nickel right
[386.28 - 393.98] we have metal in our brains toxic heavy
[389.70 - 395.82] metals and electrical currents
[393.98 - 399.90] entering
[395.82 - 402.18] arm like our neurons are hitting these
[399.90 - 403.56] metals and they're giving them wear and
[402.18 - 405.54] tear
[403.56 - 410.30] and when that happens
[405.54 - 410.30] the metals start to change
[410.52 - 414.96] their shapes change
[412.62 - 418.32] this is incredible information when I
[414.96 - 421.92] was writing this information down
[418.32 - 424.98] through the painstaking process
[421.92 - 428.04] that I desperately needed anger shifter
[424.98 - 429.72] the anger shifter at that time right
[428.04 - 432.18] this information is so incredible
[429.72 - 434.82] there's a comment on IG
[432.18 - 438.36] let's see Boheme says my ayurvedic
[434.82 - 440.16] teacher taught me this I beg to differ
[438.36 - 441.96] that's for sure
[440.16 - 445.26] somebody else said oh the same person
[441.96 - 447.42] said stop claiming you're the first
[445.26 - 449.82] your ayurvedic practitioner did not
[447.42 - 452.64] teach you what I'm telling you it was
[449.82 - 454.86] never published anywhere it's Unique and
[452.64 - 458.22] original I know
[454.86 - 461.04] that's hard to take in I'm gonna need
[458.22 - 462.54] the anger shifter today you know I know
[461.04 - 464.52] that's really hard to take in and hard
[462.54 - 466.56] to digest
[464.52 - 468.48] but the medical medium books are all
[466.56 - 471.48] from above
[468.48 - 474.62] my publisher has no requirements for me
[471.48 - 478.02] to create any citations because it's not
[474.62 - 480.24] taken from any sources here in the
[478.02 - 482.64] Alternative Health World on any level
[480.24 - 486.24] so your ayurvedic doctor
[482.64 - 488.94] does not know that electricity melts
[486.24 - 490.74] yacto particles of metals in your brain
[488.94 - 492.66] nobody did
[490.74 - 494.46] your ayurvedic practitioner didn't know
[492.66 - 496.32] about toxic heavy metals I spent 35
[494.46 - 497.52] years teaching about it and how they
[496.32 - 499.08] work in the brain and how to get them
[497.52 - 501.12] out of the brain and body that
[499.08 - 503.04] information is unknown to research in
[501.12 - 506.42] science so unless you're ayurvedic
[503.04 - 508.74] medicine doctor is making it up
[506.42 - 510.60] there's no study that shows it or
[508.74 - 512.22] anything of the sort in their teachings
[510.60 - 515.34] or any other teachings
[512.22 - 517.44] I'm not dissing alternative medicine
[515.34 - 519.30] whether you're naturopathic
[517.44 - 521.40] acupuncturist an ayurvedic doctor or
[519.30 - 524.06] whoever you are the information is
[521.40 - 524.06] unique and original
[524.64 - 528.20] and that's just a fact
[528.54 - 531.60] anyway I appreciate though you're saying
[530.58 - 533.82] that
[531.60 - 535.44] because it actually at least gives me a
[533.82 - 537.18] chance to talk about how incredible this
[535.44 - 540.92] information is how it's original how
[537.18 - 540.92] it's Unique and how amazing that is
[541.08 - 546.48] a publisher
[543.12 - 550.22] would never let this out
[546.48 - 550.22] if it wasn't original and unique
[550.56 - 554.82] that's how it works
[552.36 - 557.40] it would all have to be cited to all its
[554.82 - 561.56] sources to all the different sources out
[557.40 - 561.56] there if it wasn't original and unique
[563.82 - 567.48] enough with the fun let's get into let's
[565.80 - 569.22] talk about the powerful bits of
[567.48 - 570.66] information on here
[569.22 - 572.70] pieces of information Phyllis is
[570.66 - 574.38] absolutely fascinating when peeps claim
[572.70 - 576.12] they've heard it before just fascinating
[574.38 - 577.80] I know there's a reason for that there's
[576.12 - 581.16] a bunch of reasons for that I can go
[577.80 - 582.96] into all that someday but some do it on
[581.16 - 584.52] purpose because they heard Metals before
[582.96 - 587.42] from somebody so they think everybody
[584.52 - 587.42] knows about it
[587.96 - 594.00] does not know a lot and they have a lot
[591.24 - 597.18] of misinformation I agree with you same
[594.00 - 599.52] with TCM in fact they say the opposite I
[597.18 - 602.06] agree 100 that's accurate that's really
[599.52 - 602.06] accurate
[602.64 - 606.12] all right
[604.44 - 608.22] and maybe somebody's ayurvedic
[606.12 - 610.26] practitioner purchased the medical
[608.22 - 612.12] medium books maybe they purchased
[610.26 - 614.16] medical media maybe they purchased
[612.12 - 615.48] cleans a heel maybe they purchased Liver
[614.16 - 617.34] Rescue maybe they purchased
[615.48 - 619.56] life-changing foods and they learned
[617.34 - 623.22] about something from their
[619.56 - 626.16] and incorporated or maybe a patient came
[623.22 - 628.26] into the ayurvedic doctor's office with
[626.16 - 629.94] a book or just with the information and
[628.26 - 632.46] just started talking about metals and
[629.94 - 634.50] metals in the brain mm info and that's
[632.46 - 638.66] how they heard it
[634.50 - 638.66] but it's all original and unique
[638.94 - 643.86] the metals
[641.04 - 646.02] change shape when electricity is hitting
[643.86 - 647.28] them and then corrosion can can occur
[646.02 - 648.92] first of all there's no signs of
[647.28 - 652.02] research or anything
[648.92 - 654.60] anywhere that talks about the metals the
[652.02 - 658.04] active part-sized metals particles in
[654.60 - 658.04] the brain corroding
[658.56 - 664.74] no one knew anywhere on this planet on
[662.40 - 668.34] this Earth
[664.74 - 670.92] that corrosion occurs to nanoparticle
[668.34 - 673.56] sized Metals in the brain
[670.92 - 676.74] nobody knew that corrosion occurred to
[673.56 - 679.46] them this is just one out of whatever
[676.74 - 679.46] it's in here
[680.28 - 687.24] I need the anger shifter shot today they
[685.44 - 688.62] don't want me to be able to claim my own
[687.24 - 691.32] information
[688.62 - 693.78] isn't that hilarious they don't want me
[691.32 - 696.96] to claim my own information from above
[693.78 - 699.84] they want me to be silenced they want to
[696.96 - 702.66] make it like they can that I can't stick
[699.84 - 704.58] up for myself or stick up for the
[702.66 - 706.32] information that's so powerful
[704.58 - 709.26] they they want to take the information
[706.32 - 711.24] though from me and then
[709.26 - 712.74] and then just basically tell me that I
[711.24 - 714.24] don't know what I'm talking about and
[712.74 - 716.82] it's already out there
[714.24 - 718.80] and it keeps people from coming to it
[716.82 - 720.42] right that's the reason they do it it
[718.80 - 724.82] stops people
[720.42 - 724.82] from coming to this information
[726.42 - 729.20] it's amazing
[730.08 - 734.94] the smaller of the particles the more
[732.42 - 736.26] easily they melt under the heat of the
[734.94 - 739.08] brain
[736.26 - 741.24] so metal changes shape in the brain and
[739.08 - 743.22] the tinier the particles the easier they
[741.24 - 745.80] melt inside the brain
[743.22 - 747.90] they transform into a liquid gas
[745.80 - 751.04] chemical composition I'm sorry but that
[747.90 - 751.04] information is not out there
[753.30 - 758.52] that is the metals change from a solid
[756.12 - 760.50] to a liquid gas and can spread and cover
[758.52 - 762.48] more ground inside the brain more easily
[760.50 - 764.76] because I have a real publisher behind
[762.48 - 767.34] me right it's not independently
[764.76 - 769.70] published I can't just put any old
[767.34 - 769.70] in here
[769.74 - 775.64] cite the source
[772.20 - 775.64] I have a real publisher
[775.80 - 781.46] I can't just put information in here if
[778.38 - 781.46] I took it somewhere else
[781.68 - 787.20] I would have to cite it
[784.56 - 789.42] your serious responsibilities
[787.20 - 790.20] that go along with all of this right
[789.42 - 791.88] here
[790.20 - 793.68] in these books
[791.88 - 794.88] if I was independently published and I
[793.68 - 796.32] wanted to put out anything and
[794.88 - 798.48] everything and steal whatever I want to
[796.32 - 801.36] steal that's one thing
[798.48 - 803.10] but I can't do that this is all unique
[801.36 - 806.40] and original
[803.10 - 808.44] you guys have we even started yet
[806.40 - 810.42] when toxic heavy metals reside inside
[808.44 - 812.70] the brain and they melt you guys heavy
[810.42 - 814.56] metals that reside in the brain they can
[812.70 - 816.84] transform into a liquid gas chemical
[814.56 - 820.46] composition the metals in your brain can
[816.84 - 820.46] literally turn into liquid gas
[821.34 - 826.34] Hannity I think uh Dr Nesbit showing up
[823.92 - 826.34] today later
[828.36 - 832.82] Metals change from a solid to a liquid
[833.40 - 838.62] Madeline Scott if the info wasn't true
[836.76 - 839.46] why would they say it's already out
[838.62 - 842.04] there
[839.46 - 844.46] both can't be true thank you for sharing
[842.04 - 847.92] the truth with this aw
[844.46 - 849.24] it's a powerful comment
[847.92 - 851.70] you know what I love about the medical
[849.24 - 854.58] meaning community
[851.70 - 856.38] you guys actually understand you're
[854.58 - 859.20] smart you're seasoned
[856.38 - 860.64] your intelligence level is just off the
[859.20 - 863.22] charts
[860.64 - 864.60] you guys are smarter than me many of the
[863.22 - 866.76] people in the community are way smarter
[864.60 - 868.02] than me I'm a messenger I hear the
[866.76 - 869.94] information I write it down word for
[868.02 - 871.68] word but that doesn't make me a really
[869.94 - 873.42] highly intelligent guy there's some
[871.68 - 876.86] incredibly smart people in the medical
[873.42 - 876.86] medium Community it blows my mind
[877.08 - 881.28] but their games will all make you crazy
[878.88 - 884.52] out there the games that they play
[881.28 - 887.10] you know there are no real studies
[884.52 - 888.60] from any of it but they'll like post
[887.10 - 890.46] they'll post somebody will put a link to
[888.60 - 892.26] a blog post of something that mentions
[890.46 - 893.70] metal
[892.26 - 895.86] and then all of a sudden there's the
[893.70 - 898.04] answer but there's no even answer in
[895.86 - 898.04] there
[899.34 - 901.88] all right
[903.18 - 907.02] toxic heavy metals when they get hit
[904.98 - 912.08] with electricity and your brain heats up
[907.02 - 912.08] turns from a solid to a liquid gas
[913.08 - 916.80] science also publishes papers and
[915.24 - 919.32] theories
[916.80 - 921.00] they just study they just publish papers
[919.32 - 923.10] and theories that are written by people
[921.00 - 924.42] that steal medical medium information by
[923.10 - 927.96] the way
[924.42 - 931.38] and they also they also backdate
[927.96 - 933.12] and change and edit articles they take
[931.38 - 935.40] medical meme information now did you
[933.12 - 937.56] know this and they back date
[935.40 - 939.18] articles articles that we have
[937.56 - 943.38] screenshot
[939.18 - 945.78] they came out in like 2019 what they do
[943.38 - 947.46] is they literally change the date to use
[945.78 - 949.50] the same article and then take the date
[947.46 - 952.34] off and make it look like it's older
[949.50 - 952.34] they do that too
[952.58 - 958.44] we have so much data from so much of the
[956.22 - 960.96] trickery and the clinics are taking
[958.44 - 963.42] medical meme information every day right
[960.96 - 966.30] now with no studies behind them they're
[963.42 - 968.04] taking the mm info all the clinics right
[966.30 - 970.22] now have the medical medium brain saver
[968.04 - 973.62] books and they have
[970.22 - 975.24] clinicians reading them extracting from
[973.62 - 977.70] it
[975.24 - 979.68] and trying to publish it on their sites
[977.70 - 982.02] when there's no studies behind it and
[979.68 - 984.20] never existed before
[982.02 - 984.20] foreign
[984.48 - 988.34] but there's no darkness in this world
[989.88 - 993.84] Metals change from a solid to a liquid
[991.98 - 995.40] gas and can spread and cover more ground
[993.84 - 997.74] inside the brain more easily what that
[995.40 - 1000.44] means is when the when the metal heats
[997.74 - 1002.60] up and it turns
[1000.44 - 1005.50] from a solid to a liquid it can spread
[1002.60 - 1005.50] throughout the brain more
[1005.54 - 1009.02] and then you hear all the fork tongue
[1007.34 - 1012.44] out there
[1009.02 - 1013.88] remember that word for tongue
[1012.44 - 1017.24] because
[1013.88 - 1019.04] there's a crap ton of it going on now
[1017.24 - 1021.62] and then the media is never nice to
[1019.04 - 1023.84] Medical medium we know that how many hit
[1021.62 - 1026.00] pieces have been out there on me
[1023.84 - 1028.52] it's unbelievable
[1026.00 - 1029.96] it's unbelievable what's happening out
[1028.52 - 1031.64] there
[1029.96 - 1033.08] there's a new hit piece on medical
[1031.64 - 1036.80] medium
[1033.08 - 1039.02] like in the media every month
[1036.80 - 1040.64] and the it's just you know and that's
[1039.02 - 1042.20] what's crazy media can say whatever they
[1040.64 - 1044.42] want it's all false they can say
[1042.20 - 1047.74] whatever they want
[1044.42 - 1047.74] it's actually sick
[1049.52 - 1053.66] hey this is really great because you
[1051.50 - 1056.12] know what we're doing the anchor shifter
[1053.66 - 1057.86] today so we should talk about all this
[1056.12 - 1060.56] crap that's going down that's really
[1057.86 - 1062.24] frustrating and then we can do like an
[1060.56 - 1063.86] experiment which can get me as
[1062.24 - 1065.60] frustrated as possible out on this
[1063.86 - 1069.52] information and then I'll I'll send down
[1065.60 - 1069.52] the anger shifter it'll be fun
[1069.74 - 1073.82] let's see draw says this is my first
[1071.84 - 1075.80] time watching in medical medium live
[1073.82 - 1077.78] video after just purchasing the celery
[1075.80 - 1079.94] juice book are they always like this no
[1077.78 - 1082.04] they're not always like this
[1079.94 - 1084.26] this is the brain shot therapy cleanse
[1082.04 - 1086.84] challenge this is different so if you're
[1084.26 - 1088.76] watching this right now on IG that we're
[1086.84 - 1090.44] doing a 20-day braid shot therapy
[1088.76 - 1092.36] cleanse challenge you're welcome to join
[1090.44 - 1094.10] us for free so if you just learned about
[1092.36 - 1095.90] medical medium and you say you purchased
[1094.10 - 1097.28] a celery juice book know that
[1095.90 - 1098.84] everything's for free
[1097.28 - 1100.94] and it's powerful healing information
[1098.84 - 1103.16] it's healed Millions around the world
[1100.94 - 1105.50] saved lives all around the world you can
[1103.16 - 1107.96] join this free cleanse challenge right
[1105.50 - 1109.28] here we're doing 20 days we're having
[1107.96 - 1111.08] some fun
[1109.28 - 1112.66] we're talking about some of the stuff
[1111.08 - 1114.80] going on and when you read the books
[1112.66 - 1117.80] you'll you'll see like the information
[1114.80 - 1120.80] is just mind-blowing it's incredible
[1117.80 - 1124.10] all right so we all have toxic heavy
[1120.80 - 1126.68] metals in our head the particle size the
[1124.10 - 1129.08] smaller the particle size is
[1126.68 - 1132.14] then the change the composition of that
[1129.08 - 1134.68] metal changes so that metal then melts
[1132.14 - 1137.48] turns into from a solid to a liquid form
[1134.68 - 1139.58] the hotter your brain gets and for
[1137.48 - 1141.38] example if you're angry
[1139.58 - 1144.08] if you're mad
[1141.38 - 1146.42] the matter you get the more Angry you
[1144.08 - 1148.46] get or the amount of stress you could be
[1146.42 - 1151.70] under the brain heats up when the brain
[1148.46 - 1155.68] heats up it then transforms
[1151.70 - 1159.50] solid particles of metal like yacto size
[1155.68 - 1162.14] septocise Nano size it transforms them
[1159.50 - 1165.56] into a liquid gas then that metal
[1162.14 - 1168.14] actually travels through neurons and
[1165.56 - 1170.44] brain tissue worsening a condition over
[1168.14 - 1170.44] time
[1173.48 - 1179.80] they move and they slowly travel to
[1175.82 - 1179.80] adjacent brain tissue over the years
[1179.84 - 1184.10] melting toxic heavy metals in the brain
[1182.42 - 1185.54] are one reason why so many conditions
[1184.10 - 1187.58] and symptoms like Alzheimer's for
[1185.54 - 1190.10] example worsened with time the gas alone
[1187.58 - 1192.32] can worsen any mental physical or
[1190.10 - 1193.70] emotional condition so someone has any
[1192.32 - 1197.00] kind of issue
[1193.70 - 1199.58] whether it's brain fog confusion focus
[1197.00 - 1201.80] and concentration issues whether it's
[1199.58 - 1203.06] Alzheimer's dementia whether it's none
[1201.80 - 1204.86] of that then they're just dealing with
[1203.06 - 1207.76] some depression right
[1204.86 - 1210.68] if the metals are actually moving about
[1207.76 - 1212.00] it changes the symptoms too that's why
[1210.68 - 1213.32] someone's psychiatrist would be like
[1212.00 - 1215.90] well how come you know it's different
[1213.32 - 1217.64] than it was a year ago how come it's
[1215.90 - 1220.24] different than it was two years ago they
[1217.64 - 1224.20] don't know meanwhile metals are melting
[1220.24 - 1224.20] transforming and moving around
[1224.84 - 1230.78] another reason brain conditions worsen
[1227.66 - 1232.28] with time is that more toxic heavy
[1230.78 - 1234.26] metals continue to collect in certain
[1232.28 - 1237.38] areas of the brain
[1234.26 - 1240.74] the brain's electromagnetic field draws
[1237.38 - 1244.84] Metals in I'm on page 30 of brain saver
[1240.74 - 1244.84] people keep on asking where am I
[1248.30 - 1253.06] so toxic heavy metals
[1251.18 - 1255.20] get attracted to the electric
[1253.06 - 1257.68] electromagnetic field that the brain
[1255.20 - 1257.68] causes
[1257.78 - 1263.84] that electromagnetic field draws metal
[1260.06 - 1265.88] in creating an accumulation effect that
[1263.84 - 1268.60] makes large deposits of toxic heavy
[1265.88 - 1271.58] metals keep growing so our
[1268.60 - 1273.14] electromagnetic field pulls Metals into
[1271.58 - 1274.76] the deposits that are happening inside
[1273.14 - 1277.22] the brain that are collecting inside the
[1274.76 - 1278.90] brain building these deposits bigger and
[1277.22 - 1280.22] bigger that's another thing that happens
[1278.90 - 1282.56] too
[1280.22 - 1285.38] especially if we're angry all the time
[1282.56 - 1287.78] and we're melting the particles and the
[1285.38 - 1289.82] particles are going from a solid to a
[1287.78 - 1292.76] liquid form and then hardening back up
[1289.82 - 1294.92] into a solid form they eventually can go
[1292.76 - 1296.54] and find other metal deposits like
[1294.92 - 1301.00] Mercury
[1296.54 - 1301.00] so Mercury can find Mercury this way
[1301.10 - 1306.80] as mercury melts
[1303.32 - 1310.40] it can transform into a gas and then
[1306.80 - 1312.02] move as it's moving and we're angry and
[1310.40 - 1315.08] that electricity is going through our
[1312.02 - 1318.02] brain an electromagnetic field can draw
[1315.08 - 1320.86] the mercury in even more collecting into
[1318.02 - 1320.86] a deposit
[1324.26 - 1327.86] um creating an accumulation effect that
[1326.12 - 1330.44] makes large deposits of toxic heavy
[1327.86 - 1333.14] metals keep growing the larger the
[1330.44 - 1335.00] deposit the greater its electromagnetic
[1333.14 - 1337.34] pool so that's another thing too the
[1335.00 - 1340.28] larger the deposit of metal aluminum
[1337.34 - 1342.20] Mercury lead arsenic cadmium nickel
[1340.28 - 1345.14] building up in the brain the larger the
[1342.20 - 1349.10] deposit that's inside our brain
[1345.14 - 1351.74] the more electromagnetic pull it has so
[1349.10 - 1354.50] that metal deposit inside somebody's
[1351.74 - 1355.94] brain whether it's the left hemisphere
[1354.50 - 1358.82] the right hemisphere frontal lobe
[1355.94 - 1360.62] whatever wherever it's residing the
[1358.82 - 1363.44] brain stem
[1360.62 - 1364.76] it's going to draw more
[1363.44 - 1367.28] metal
[1364.76 - 1370.22] to that deposit it's going to be a
[1367.28 - 1372.80] stronger electromagnetic field
[1370.22 - 1375.56] it will keep attracting toxic heavy
[1372.80 - 1377.54] metals into it making the deposit larger
[1375.56 - 1379.76] and larger over time because that's what
[1377.54 - 1383.06] happens to people if you don't get the
[1379.76 - 1385.76] metals out of your brain
[1383.06 - 1389.02] the deposits will keep growing and
[1385.76 - 1389.02] growing and growing
[1389.06 - 1394.34] and that gets us in trouble because if
[1392.06 - 1396.92] we're not being at if we're not actively
[1394.34 - 1399.20] getting the metals out of our brain and
[1396.92 - 1402.52] the metal deposits are growing larger
[1399.20 - 1402.52] inside of our brain
[1403.58 - 1409.10] then there's more corrosion that current
[1405.50 - 1410.84] occurs within that big deposit
[1409.10 - 1412.52] and then we end up getting Alzheimer's
[1410.84 - 1414.56] down the road
[1412.52 - 1417.08] Tamara Jones says
[1414.56 - 1419.18] there is high level competition among
[1417.08 - 1421.22] scientists to get grants yes and their
[1419.18 - 1423.56] careers ride on this yes the lying is
[1421.22 - 1425.48] rampant true 100 percent
[1423.56 - 1427.52] and they're also hungry for new
[1425.48 - 1430.94] information so they take it from the
[1427.52 - 1432.50] little medical medium and we know this
[1430.94 - 1435.08] if someone's doubting that it's actually
[1432.50 - 1437.24] factual we have evidence for instance
[1435.08 - 1439.16] the publication of multiple sclerosis
[1437.24 - 1442.46] being caused by Epstein-Barr and then
[1439.16 - 1443.96] Harvard took that info and published it
[1442.46 - 1445.58] eight years later after medical medium
[1443.96 - 1449.32] already published it
[1445.58 - 1449.32] and I taught about it for years too
[1450.68 - 1456.58] so we have
[1452.60 - 1456.58] lots of evidence of that
[1457.58 - 1462.02] while the brain's electromagnetic field
[1459.68 - 1464.12] is drawing toxic heavy metals into other
[1462.02 - 1465.68] areas of the brain too the metals tend
[1464.12 - 1468.74] to accumulate where the field is
[1465.68 - 1470.60] stronger due to these nuggets nuggets
[1468.74 - 1473.00] you know about gold nuggets
[1470.60 - 1475.90] right gold nuggets everybody wants a
[1473.00 - 1475.90] gold nugget
[1477.32 - 1480.98] all the miners the gold miners are
[1479.18 - 1483.98] looking for gold
[1480.98 - 1486.26] always want gold nuggets
[1483.98 - 1489.14] well we get in our head instead of gold
[1486.26 - 1491.36] nuggets we get Mercury nuggets we get
[1489.14 - 1494.42] nickel nuggets we get aluminum nuggets
[1491.36 - 1496.10] we get copper nuggets Jackie B good to
[1494.42 - 1498.38] see you hey at least if we're pissed
[1496.10 - 1500.72] beforehand we'll feel it working laugh
[1498.38 - 1502.76] out loud and I can't wait that's exactly
[1500.72 - 1505.04] true like I think I'm getting you guys
[1502.76 - 1507.80] all riled up by accident or something
[1505.04 - 1509.96] because I'm getting riled up
[1507.80 - 1512.48] Hannah T been on heavy metal detox
[1509.96 - 1514.34] smoothie for three years and now in the
[1512.48 - 1517.22] metal exposure shots I'm getting medals
[1514.34 - 1520.28] out like crazy my mental state has
[1517.22 - 1524.72] improved a thousand fold Hannity there's
[1520.28 - 1527.72] a guest coming on later to say hi to you
[1524.72 - 1527.72] doctor
[1532.34 - 1536.12] when it comes to Mercury deposits
[1534.38 - 1539.12] they're not just formed through
[1536.12 - 1540.80] electromagnetic Pole
[1539.12 - 1542.78] Mercury doesn't need this
[1540.80 - 1544.16] electromagnetic field to accumulate in
[1542.78 - 1546.92] the brain so Mercury is one of those
[1544.16 - 1549.38] rare metals that doesn't need the
[1546.92 - 1552.50] electromagnetic electromagnetic field in
[1549.38 - 1554.72] our brain to grab onto an additional
[1552.50 - 1556.04] metal and bring it in and create that
[1554.72 - 1561.64] nugget
[1556.04 - 1561.64] Mercury finds Mercury on its own
[1564.08 - 1568.04] and
[1565.64 - 1570.26] hence it says it right here Mercury
[1568.04 - 1572.30] finds Mercury on its own
[1570.26 - 1575.84] with Mercury deposits forming in the
[1572.30 - 1578.96] brain both from electromagnetic
[1575.84 - 1581.60] nature and from Mercury's tendency to
[1578.96 - 1583.76] find Mercury Mercury deposits are that
[1581.60 - 1585.74] much more of a hindrance so what happens
[1583.76 - 1587.36] with people with Alzheimer's dementia
[1585.74 - 1590.18] what happens with people
[1587.36 - 1592.34] with the personalization with depression
[1590.18 - 1594.20] with severe anxiety severe depression
[1592.34 - 1598.46] what happens with people with bipolar
[1594.20 - 1601.04] and OCD Mercury deposits they're a big
[1598.46 - 1603.80] nuisance because Mercury finds Mercury
[1601.04 - 1606.20] easily without even our electromagnetic
[1603.80 - 1609.02] field doing it so Mercury finds Mercury
[1606.20 - 1610.82] easy so Mercury deposits become bigger
[1609.02 - 1612.98] in our brains that's why it's critical
[1610.82 - 1617.50] to get those Mercury deposits out
[1612.98 - 1617.50] because they're really a hindrance
[1618.74 - 1624.98] scientists need a hypotheses
[1622.16 - 1626.42] to do anything with to even attempt to
[1624.98 - 1628.34] do anything
[1626.42 - 1630.86] where do where do they get their
[1628.34 - 1632.90] hypotheses I'd like to know well from
[1630.86 - 1635.00] medical medium all the time
[1632.90 - 1637.60] that
[1635.00 - 1637.60] that
[1638.60 - 1642.82] when it comes to Mercury deposits
[1640.76 - 1645.32] they're not just formed through
[1642.82 - 1647.12] electromagnetic fields as I said Mercury
[1645.32 - 1648.98] finds itself important thing to remember
[1647.12 - 1651.62] if we're experiencing a lot of friction
[1648.98 - 1654.74] and stress in our lives
[1651.62 - 1656.84] yeah what electricity travels through
[1654.74 - 1659.32] our brain at a higher intensity and
[1656.84 - 1659.32] velocity
[1659.60 - 1667.04] so for under stress electricity travels
[1663.32 - 1669.38] through our brain at a higher velocity
[1667.04 - 1671.54] a higher intensity
[1669.38 - 1673.76] because adrenaline here science and
[1671.54 - 1676.58] researchers know this check this out
[1673.76 - 1678.92] because adrenaline both increases heart
[1676.58 - 1682.06] rate and enters the brain raising the
[1678.92 - 1686.30] brain's heat levels
[1682.06 - 1688.64] adrenaline raises the brain's heat
[1686.30 - 1690.32] levels
[1688.64 - 1691.58] I remember when I was writing that down
[1690.32 - 1694.10] and I heard that piece of information
[1691.58 - 1696.94] from above right from SOC I was just
[1694.10 - 1696.94] like Blown Away
[1699.32 - 1702.98] so when we're under stress electricity
[1701.60 - 1705.74] is running through our brain in that
[1702.98 - 1708.20] high velocity and high intensity
[1705.74 - 1711.80] and it raises the heat levels but
[1708.20 - 1714.32] adrenaline contributes to
[1711.80 - 1718.06] because it increases the heart rate and
[1714.32 - 1718.06] that adrenaline then enters the brain
[1718.52 - 1722.54] the more toxic heavy metals in the brain
[1720.74 - 1724.94] the hotter it runs
[1722.54 - 1727.40] so here's another problem the more metal
[1724.94 - 1730.30] we have in our brains the hotter our
[1727.40 - 1730.30] brains run
[1730.76 - 1735.02] the more metal particles we have
[1732.50 - 1738.28] throughout our brain the hotter our
[1735.02 - 1738.28] brain is
[1738.74 - 1745.52] and remember this Metals retain heat
[1742.64 - 1746.90] metal retains
[1745.52 - 1748.82] Heat
[1746.90 - 1751.10] that's so important to know it could
[1748.82 - 1752.36] become a vicious cycle I don't like this
[1751.10 - 1754.88] vicious cycle
[1752.36 - 1757.58] for instance someone who's
[1754.88 - 1760.46] perpetually angry about anything and
[1757.58 - 1763.82] everything we're talking about anger
[1760.46 - 1766.52] someone who's always angry about
[1763.82 - 1770.72] anything and everything
[1766.52 - 1773.54] or who has frequent spells of anger
[1770.72 - 1775.66] may have higher levels of toxic heavy
[1773.54 - 1778.58] metals in the brain in the first place
[1775.66 - 1780.50] and that's aggravating the anger and I
[1778.58 - 1783.20] talked about that earlier right the more
[1780.50 - 1785.54] metal we have in our brain the more it
[1783.20 - 1788.92] makes us frustrated and angry the more
[1785.54 - 1788.92] we have bouts of anger
[1789.68 - 1793.70] the more bouts of anger we have the more
[1791.90 - 1795.68] we're heating up the battles it's this
[1793.70 - 1798.34] vicious cycle that keeps on going over
[1795.68 - 1798.34] and over again
[1801.92 - 1807.38] as he is generated for any reason the
[1805.16 - 1809.84] metals change shape and form those anger
[1807.38 - 1811.70] spells will then generate more heat as
[1809.84 - 1815.00] anger raises the electrical field
[1811.70 - 1816.98] creating an electrical storm
[1815.00 - 1820.34] what you'll notice when someone's really
[1816.98 - 1822.92] angry and they got medals involved an
[1820.34 - 1824.96] electrical storm happens inside their
[1822.92 - 1827.42] brain grid
[1824.96 - 1829.28] which in turn melts more metal so that
[1827.42 - 1830.90] it spreads and has the potential to
[1829.28 - 1832.88] interfere with even more electrical
[1830.90 - 1834.38] signals in the brain that's the Vicious
[1832.88 - 1835.46] Cycle about it that's why it's critical
[1834.38 - 1837.38] to
[1835.46 - 1839.12] be on anchor shifter if you're angry all
[1837.38 - 1840.98] the time the other thing is it's
[1839.12 - 1843.52] critical to know this so you can get the
[1840.98 - 1843.52] metals out
[1845.24 - 1848.72] which in turn melts more metal so that
[1847.16 - 1850.28] it spreads and the potential to
[1848.72 - 1852.38] interfere with more electrical signals
[1850.28 - 1854.60] in the brain those melting toxic heavy
[1852.38 - 1856.52] metal spreading through spreading their
[1854.60 - 1858.44] liquid gas can hinder bodily functions
[1856.52 - 1862.24] and communication I see so many people
[1858.44 - 1865.72] out there suffering so bad
[1862.24 - 1869.00] suffering emotionally suffering mentally
[1865.72 - 1871.76] suffering physically just
[1869.00 - 1873.26] just plain out suffering and they're
[1871.76 - 1875.36] stuck in these Vicious Cycles of
[1873.26 - 1876.86] depression and frustration and anger
[1875.36 - 1880.52] then depression and sadness to
[1876.86 - 1883.46] frustration and anger then then OCD then
[1880.52 - 1886.64] bipolar frustration Mania then anger
[1883.46 - 1890.54] than just all of it like they're stuck
[1886.64 - 1894.44] in it and no one's telling them no one's
[1890.54 - 1896.78] teaching them the cause of this is toxic
[1894.44 - 1899.96] heavy metals you have mercury you have
[1896.78 - 1902.48] aluminum you have copper you have nickel
[1899.96 - 1905.66] you have lead in the brain and it's not
[1902.48 - 1908.06] findable unless someone cuts open your
[1905.66 - 1909.56] brain and puts it under a microscope and
[1908.06 - 1911.42] they're not going to do that because
[1909.56 - 1912.38] they don't want to find metal in the
[1911.42 - 1915.50] brain
[1912.38 - 1917.72] if the industry finds metal inside our
[1915.50 - 1919.88] brains the industry would be blamed for
[1917.72 - 1921.62] it because those Metals will go back the
[1919.88 - 1923.00] forensics will show where those Metals
[1921.62 - 1924.80] go back to in a lot of its
[1923.00 - 1928.04] Pharmaceuticals
[1924.80 - 1932.60] because Pharmaceuticals use a branding
[1928.04 - 1935.24] type of metal an industrial metal that's
[1932.60 - 1937.52] different than other metals and if that
[1935.24 - 1939.80] was ever distinguished it would show
[1937.52 - 1942.28] pharmaceutical Metals inside of our
[1939.80 - 1942.28] brains
[1943.52 - 1947.24] so so the science of research doesn't
[1945.62 - 1949.76] want to know metals are inside our
[1947.24 - 1951.32] brains they just let people stay sick
[1949.76 - 1952.82] and sick and sick till down the road
[1951.32 - 1954.02] they end up dying down the road or
[1952.82 - 1955.28] something for some reason they're never
[1954.02 - 1957.80] going to cut open their brain and look
[1955.28 - 1960.86] and say oh whoa what's all this metal
[1957.80 - 1962.78] doing here in the brain tissue hmm why
[1960.86 - 1964.76] is the brain stem filled with metal hmm
[1962.78 - 1966.50] what kind of metal is this well it looks
[1964.76 - 1969.62] like an industrial variety of metal
[1966.50 - 1972.04] that's used in Pharmaceuticals
[1969.62 - 1975.26] foreign
[1972.04 - 1977.06] on YouTube thanks let's see what does
[1975.26 - 1979.58] this comment say from Omar this is
[1977.06 - 1982.18] actually very fascinating honored thank
[1979.58 - 1982.18] you for being here
[1982.36 - 1987.08] if you're new here you guys anybody new
[1985.40 - 1988.88] here
[1987.08 - 1991.28] you're wondering if this is a normal
[1988.88 - 1993.44] medical medium
[1991.28 - 1996.02] this is a normal medical medium live
[1993.44 - 1998.84] we're live right now by the way
[1996.02 - 2000.76] this isn't pre-recorded
[1998.84 - 2002.14] if this is normal I don't know if this
[2000.76 - 2004.12] is normal
[2002.14 - 2005.80] but check out medical meme podcasts at
[2004.12 - 2007.60] Apple podcast when you get a chance and
[2005.80 - 2008.80] listen to all my podcast episodes if
[2007.60 - 2011.04] you're brand new to Medical beam
[2008.80 - 2011.04] information
[2016.54 - 2020.64] all right let's keep on going just
[2018.28 - 2024.52] looking into the info here
[2020.64 - 2026.80] people know stress and anger as bad for
[2024.52 - 2029.62] our brain and body and health we do know
[2026.80 - 2031.36] that too much stress not good give you a
[2029.62 - 2033.70] headache
[2031.36 - 2036.82] those in the health world don't know why
[2033.70 - 2039.06] they're bad for our health
[2036.82 - 2039.06] foreign
[2039.88 - 2045.70] it is innately known out there that too
[2043.30 - 2048.58] much anger and too much stress isn't
[2045.70 - 2050.92] good for our body that's known out there
[2048.58 - 2054.94] but those in the health world don't know
[2050.92 - 2058.32] why we're talking about why
[2054.94 - 2062.70] that's all about the mm info it's why
[2058.32 - 2062.70] how where what
[2065.86 - 2070.60] they don't know what systematically is
[2068.32 - 2073.00] at the root of it they don't know about
[2070.60 - 2075.40] the process occurring inside of our
[2073.00 - 2077.68] brain the health world has no idea how
[2075.40 - 2079.54] anger affects the brain in this way they
[2077.68 - 2082.48] don't know why even with the best
[2079.54 - 2084.46] Neuroscience techniques meditations and
[2082.48 - 2086.44] thought pattern construction which is
[2084.46 - 2088.66] all great and all mastering the mind is
[2086.44 - 2090.58] a struggle for so many wise strategies
[2088.66 - 2093.46] for managing stress and anger patterns
[2090.58 - 2095.74] can fail and why people fall back to Old
[2093.46 - 2098.70] patterns we don't know why
[2095.74 - 2098.70] why
[2099.46 - 2104.02] this is why
[2101.44 - 2107.38] people struggle because of the toxic
[2104.02 - 2110.32] heavy metals Underneath It All
[2107.38 - 2112.18] trying to hack or rewire our minds leads
[2110.32 - 2113.50] us back to the same old patterns if
[2112.18 - 2115.60] toxic heavy metals are not being
[2113.50 - 2117.64] addressed at the same time
[2115.60 - 2119.38] there are people in the medical medium
[2117.64 - 2121.50] community over the years
[2119.38 - 2125.38] that have healed
[2121.50 - 2128.08] their emotional
[2125.38 - 2130.68] struggles through just ridding Metals
[2128.08 - 2134.14] out of their brain
[2130.68 - 2137.86] allowing them to play in meditation land
[2134.14 - 2140.14] again allowing them to play in the
[2137.86 - 2142.24] spiritual world again allowing them to
[2140.14 - 2145.42] do these things because
[2142.24 - 2148.42] they were healed the medals got out of
[2145.42 - 2151.18] their brain and the natural process that
[2148.42 - 2153.04] followed was beautiful The Details
[2151.18 - 2156.06] Matter
[2153.04 - 2156.06] with all of this
[2158.50 - 2161.68] if you don't get the medals out of your
[2160.54 - 2164.76] brain
[2161.68 - 2166.96] you can be
[2164.76 - 2171.54] seeking help
[2166.96 - 2171.54] for your emotional torment forever
[2171.64 - 2175.36] a whole lifetime of doing it 30 40 50
[2174.34 - 2177.70] years
[2175.36 - 2179.98] Hennis says no other modality worked
[2177.70 - 2182.38] when I was dying with botox poisoning
[2179.98 - 2184.30] people don't talk about Botox Botox
[2182.38 - 2186.16] poisoning enough out there
[2184.30 - 2188.86] I just don't
[2186.16 - 2191.44] only medical medium info works if you
[2188.86 - 2193.66] are too sick and that the details matter
[2191.44 - 2195.40] right there if you are too sick
[2193.66 - 2196.78] Hannah thank you for writing this
[2195.40 - 2199.96] comment
[2196.78 - 2203.14] I am forever grateful to have found UAW
[2199.96 - 2205.18] thank you so much aw and SOC
[2203.14 - 2207.40] people don't talk about Botox poisoning
[2205.18 - 2208.90] enough how bad it really is meaning how
[2207.40 - 2210.40] many people have suffered from Botox
[2208.90 - 2212.56] poisoning
[2210.40 - 2213.88] holy cow and the needle doesn't always
[2212.56 - 2216.58] land right
[2213.88 - 2218.68] when they when they apply Botox
[2216.58 - 2220.48] it's like sure you know
[2218.68 - 2221.56] okay I'm ready I'm in the chair it's
[2220.48 - 2223.96] like
[2221.56 - 2226.72] oh
[2223.96 - 2228.58] okay it's in there pull it out
[2226.72 - 2231.12] and
[2228.58 - 2231.12] right
[2232.84 - 2235.50] but anyway
[2238.00 - 2243.76] sure you know it's like botulism variety
[2241.78 - 2246.52] of pharmaceuticals right
[2243.76 - 2250.32] cosmetic botulism use people don't talk
[2246.52 - 2250.32] about cosmetic botulism use
[2251.26 - 2255.16] all right
[2253.12 - 2256.66] let's move on a little bit
[2255.16 - 2259.14] yeah
[2256.66 - 2261.40] thank you for dealing with me
[2259.14 - 2263.68] reading through all of this I really
[2261.40 - 2266.56] appreciate you guys your patience too
[2263.68 - 2268.84] Iona says McLeod says I healed extreme
[2266.56 - 2271.24] OCD whoa just knowing that you went
[2268.84 - 2273.94] through extreme OCD it's just terrible
[2271.24 - 2276.54] which used to take up hours of my day I
[2273.94 - 2280.18] understand why is social anxiety
[2276.54 - 2283.96] stuttering taking longer to heal okay so
[2280.18 - 2286.36] first of all if your OCB is healed
[2283.96 - 2289.78] extreme OCD
[2286.36 - 2292.18] that's incredible because OCD metal
[2289.78 - 2295.12] deposits
[2292.18 - 2297.40] we're stopping electrical impulses from
[2295.12 - 2298.60] going through and they were bouncing I
[2297.40 - 2300.22] talk about in the Brain book They're
[2298.60 - 2303.22] bouncing off that metal deposit then
[2300.22 - 2304.48] ricocheting up then ricocheting up
[2303.22 - 2307.84] if you have other things you're working
[2304.48 - 2310.38] on healing if you had severe OCD to
[2307.84 - 2310.38] begin with
[2311.32 - 2315.34] then
[2312.58 - 2317.38] there was a lot of metal there
[2315.34 - 2318.82] we we have to do a lot of work take the
[2317.38 - 2321.52] books to your doctor ask your doctor
[2318.82 - 2323.74] what's right for you
[2321.52 - 2325.54] but when I talk to doctors about OCB I
[2323.74 - 2327.28] notice that there are patients have a
[2325.54 - 2329.08] tremendous amount of metal inside their
[2327.28 - 2330.34] brains
[2329.08 - 2333.10] and
[2330.34 - 2334.42] so severe OCD means there's more Metals
[2333.10 - 2335.74] inside the brain with so many doctors
[2334.42 - 2337.00] I've talked to with their patients that
[2335.74 - 2338.02] have helped with that I helped the
[2337.00 - 2340.56] doctors figure out what's wrong with
[2338.02 - 2340.56] their patients
[2343.90 - 2348.76] if he says only after doing medical
[2345.82 - 2350.74] medium protocols did I realize all
[2348.76 - 2353.56] non-physical techniques like meditation
[2350.74 - 2355.96] therapy counseling psychedelics Etc just
[2353.56 - 2358.12] try to compensate for physical defects
[2355.96 - 2362.58] in the body but don't heal they're just
[2358.12 - 2362.58] Band-Aids they're just Band-Aids
[2363.94 - 2367.48] I don't like the Psychedelic Band-Aid
[2365.86 - 2369.22] but meditation Band-Aids cool there's
[2367.48 - 2371.02] there's that mean I'm totally I'm
[2369.22 - 2372.28] totally into meditations Spirit of
[2371.02 - 2375.40] compassion has given me so many
[2372.28 - 2377.14] meditations to help to help um everybody
[2375.40 - 2378.94] and they're in the books there's so many
[2377.14 - 2382.18] meditations in these books now there's
[2378.94 - 2385.12] medically there's meditations in Liver
[2382.18 - 2387.10] Rescue there's meditations in medical
[2385.12 - 2389.02] medium book one there's meditations in
[2387.10 - 2391.00] brain saver there's there
[2389.02 - 2394.18] right and they're really powerful and
[2391.00 - 2397.48] they help really shift and rewire but I
[2394.18 - 2398.80] notice out there like psychedelics and I
[2397.48 - 2400.84] always tell people go to your therapist
[2398.80 - 2402.40] go to your accounts counselor go to your
[2400.84 - 2404.62] therapist go to your counselor do your
[2402.40 - 2406.84] meditations but I never tell them do
[2404.62 - 2409.42] your psychedelics
[2406.84 - 2411.34] I'm always pro-counselors Pro therapy
[2409.42 - 2412.72] whatever Pro meditation anybody wants to
[2411.34 - 2413.56] do any meditations out there in the
[2412.72 - 2417.70] world
[2413.56 - 2420.70] but I'm not pro psychedelics
[2417.70 - 2423.46] I'm sorry but I'm not and I never will
[2420.70 - 2427.00] be Pro psychedelic
[2423.46 - 2430.42] I'm I'm pro- why someone is trying to
[2427.00 - 2432.40] use a psychedelic because I feel for
[2430.42 - 2433.90] them and I'm not judging them I know
[2432.40 - 2436.66] they're using a psychedelic because
[2433.90 - 2438.40] they're not well they're sick and no one
[2436.66 - 2439.78] understands them and what's wrong so
[2438.40 - 2441.64] they're trying a psychedelic because
[2439.78 - 2444.46] they really don't know what else to do
[2441.64 - 2446.50] so I'm Pro that person not judging them
[2444.46 - 2449.86] or shaming them I'm not pro-sychedelic
[2446.50 - 2452.32] use read the chapter on microdosing
[2449.86 - 2455.32] inside brain saver here the micro dosing
[2452.32 - 2458.82] chapter it's insane I can't wait to read
[2455.32 - 2458.82] it someday to you guys too
[2465.22 - 2468.88] trying to hack or rewire our minds leads
[2467.44 - 2470.98] us back to the same old patterns of
[2468.88 - 2472.84] toxic heavy if toxic heavy metals are
[2470.98 - 2474.52] still stuck in the brain and not leaving
[2472.84 - 2476.92] the brain
[2474.52 - 2478.42] all right
[2476.92 - 2482.16] I want to find another little spot to
[2478.42 - 2482.16] read if you guys got a moment
[2482.26 - 2485.34] if that's okay
[2486.88 - 2492.28] it's chronic anger disorder section
[2489.94 - 2494.02] I don't know if you guys want to do uh
[2492.28 - 2495.46] an intermission at all do you want to do
[2494.02 - 2497.26] a half time maybe break it up before
[2495.46 - 2499.92] we'll do that a little later all right
[2497.26 - 2499.92] let's keep on going
[2500.98 - 2506.94] chronic anger disorder on page 340 in
[2504.10 - 2506.94] brain saver
[2507.10 - 2513.58] if post-traumatic stress disorder
[2510.46 - 2516.22] has been ruled out
[2513.58 - 2519.52] which is to say if it's been determined
[2516.22 - 2522.10] that Trauma from past abuse or suffering
[2519.52 - 2523.90] is not the cause of someone's chronic
[2522.10 - 2527.44] anger
[2523.90 - 2529.92] and rather it's unexplained chronic
[2527.44 - 2534.42] anger
[2529.92 - 2534.42] unexplained chronic anger
[2536.26 - 2542.86] then toxic heavy metals saturating
[2539.52 - 2545.68] emotional areas of the brain
[2542.86 - 2549.06] and a stagnant sluggish liver are the
[2545.68 - 2549.06] underlying causes
[2550.96 - 2557.08] keep in mind
[2552.94 - 2559.92] you can also have a mix of all three
[2557.08 - 2559.92] trauma
[2560.68 - 2565.12] metals
[2562.66 - 2567.40] and an overloaded overworked stagnant
[2565.12 - 2570.58] sluggish overburdened liver
[2567.40 - 2573.06] all terms from original medical medium
[2570.58 - 2573.06] info
[2573.10 - 2579.34] if I don't shout out for my self then
[2577.06 - 2581.80] what am I going to do
[2579.34 - 2584.32] if someone had a sluggish liver and went
[2581.80 - 2586.66] through mental abuse and toxic heavy
[2584.32 - 2588.94] metal exposure at roughly the same time
[2586.66 - 2590.56] The Chronic anger will often be
[2588.94 - 2593.32] expressed more aggressively and more
[2590.56 - 2595.90] frequently so many people have had toxic
[2593.32 - 2598.86] heavy metal exposure during some trauma
[2595.90 - 2598.86] at the same moment
[2599.14 - 2605.38] I can tell you one area where that has
[2602.02 - 2607.30] happened recently with millions of
[2605.38 - 2610.24] people
[2607.30 - 2612.64] not just millions of people in this
[2610.24 - 2614.86] country of the United States but
[2612.64 - 2618.12] millions of people all around the world
[2614.86 - 2618.12] in other countries
[2620.08 - 2623.68] there was a lot of trauma that occurred
[2622.00 - 2625.24] the last two and a half years a couple
[2623.68 - 2628.60] years whatever it's been now a little
[2625.24 - 2631.42] bit more and a lot of mercury entered a
[2628.60 - 2633.40] lot of people's bodies at the same time
[2631.42 - 2637.86] they were emotionally
[2633.40 - 2637.86] trauma traumatized and tortured
[2644.38 - 2648.46] and it's heartbreaking
[2646.66 - 2650.44] I'm not just talking about 10 people I'm
[2648.46 - 2654.82] talking about Millions
[2650.44 - 2657.46] tens and tens and tens and millions
[2654.82 - 2660.24] were tortured emotionally recently and
[2657.46 - 2663.22] Mercury entered their bodies
[2660.24 - 2665.02] their brains
[2663.22 - 2666.82] someone had a sluggish liver and went
[2665.02 - 2669.82] through mental abuse of toxic heavy
[2666.82 - 2671.62] metal exposure roughly the same time
[2669.82 - 2674.26] that's what I'm talking about that's
[2671.62 - 2676.12] just one example chronic anger will
[2674.26 - 2678.16] often be expressed more aggressively and
[2676.12 - 2680.02] more frequently for example if someone
[2678.16 - 2681.04] went and got their Mercury Dental
[2680.02 - 2682.66] filling so it wasn't talking about
[2681.04 - 2684.94] Mercury Dental fillings but I'm just
[2682.66 - 2686.98] saying I'm talking about it now
[2684.94 - 2688.48] this is just I think one example if
[2686.98 - 2690.46] someone went and got their Mercury
[2688.48 - 2692.92] Dental fillings removed
[2690.46 - 2695.56] which destabilizes the metal and also
[2692.92 - 2697.48] got the worst news that day or week so
[2695.56 - 2700.30] the day they had their Mercury amalgam
[2697.48 - 2701.74] removed they also was they also got a
[2700.30 - 2703.54] bunch of bad news
[2701.74 - 2706.12] keep this in mind how it works this is
[2703.54 - 2708.52] incredible information
[2706.12 - 2710.92] simultaneously if someone had a Mercury
[2708.52 - 2713.08] filling removed at the same time they
[2710.92 - 2714.88] had a breakup in a relationship or some
[2713.08 - 2718.14] other type of trauma or some kind of
[2714.88 - 2718.14] emotional hardship or stress
[2718.84 - 2724.00] the emotional impact of
[2721.72 - 2725.62] of the difficult development plus the
[2724.00 - 2727.90] Mercury exposure can lead to more
[2725.62 - 2729.58] symptoms of frustration and anger if the
[2727.90 - 2732.00] Mercury saturates the brain's emotional
[2729.58 - 2732.00] centers
[2732.28 - 2735.66] it's really Advanced information
[2735.94 - 2739.84] go back and read the medical mean and
[2737.86 - 2741.70] book series all the time people think I
[2739.84 - 2743.92] should know every single word that's
[2741.70 - 2747.18] been put in these eight volumes these
[2743.92 - 2747.18] eight volumes here in books
[2747.22 - 2750.82] but between hearing Spirit of compassion
[2749.38 - 2753.16] all the time in my ear giving me
[2750.82 - 2756.10] additional information non-stop every
[2753.16 - 2757.90] day including what SSC already put in
[2756.10 - 2759.64] all these books it's it's almost like an
[2757.90 - 2761.82] impossibility to just keep it all
[2759.64 - 2761.82] together
[2762.64 - 2770.08] see Vex lens on IG said yep therapy is a
[2767.62 - 2774.34] coping mechanism to help you
[2770.08 - 2777.64] love with symptoms but it does not get
[2774.34 - 2780.76] rid of symptoms since it does not
[2777.64 - 2783.82] address the cause
[2780.76 - 2786.82] that's really that's really so true
[2783.82 - 2788.46] it's a really amazing comment
[2786.82 - 2791.14] foreign
[2788.46 - 2793.18] saturating other areas of the brain can
[2791.14 - 2795.76] lead to other neurological symptoms such
[2793.18 - 2797.74] as fatigue
[2795.76 - 2799.30] nobody knew that
[2797.74 - 2801.04] mm info
[2799.30 - 2803.14] just saying
[2801.04 - 2806.20] most often chronic anger stems from
[2803.14 - 2810.00] toxic heavy metal exposures long ago in
[2806.20 - 2810.00] childhood happens a lot too
[2810.04 - 2814.72] here with Mariana says I healed an
[2812.56 - 2817.68] addiction
[2814.72 - 2817.68] that's incredible
[2821.86 - 2827.02] so most often chronic anger stems from
[2824.08 - 2828.40] toxic heavy metal exposures long ago in
[2827.02 - 2831.52] childhood
[2828.40 - 2834.60] can you think of any
[2831.52 - 2838.48] toxic heavy metal exposures in childhood
[2834.60 - 2841.84] oh I can think of plenty
[2838.48 - 2844.18] as someone gets older the metals age and
[2841.84 - 2847.08] oxidize causing chronic anger to worsen
[2844.18 - 2847.08] through later years
[2847.24 - 2852.16] anger can worsen as you get older
[2849.88 - 2855.16] because the metals are oxidizing that
[2852.16 - 2857.44] happens to so many people anger worsens
[2855.16 - 2859.12] as the years go on
[2857.44 - 2861.88] cold white spring says I could think of
[2859.12 - 2863.98] some kind as the years go on Tara
[2861.88 - 2866.74] Appleman mind-blowing information no one
[2863.98 - 2869.56] could come up with this if they tried I
[2866.74 - 2873.76] agree it can only be from above
[2869.56 - 2878.04] so complex but clear exactly and Tara I
[2873.76 - 2878.04] am not a smart guy
[2878.74 - 2882.64] there's a doctor like pretty recently
[2880.78 - 2884.44] called me a genius
[2882.64 - 2887.32] because he doesn't believe it comes from
[2884.44 - 2890.20] above so he thinks I'm a genius
[2887.32 - 2892.36] I was like I don't know what to tell you
[2890.20 - 2893.62] but it came from above and it didn't
[2892.36 - 2896.38] come from me
[2893.62 - 2899.44] so now you have to be a genius like I'm
[2896.38 - 2901.72] not I'm not
[2899.44 - 2904.00] realist says that's why it's hard for
[2901.72 - 2905.80] all of us to start to change it's so
[2904.00 - 2908.50] much information I wish it was easier
[2905.80 - 2910.78] step one two three to heal thank you for
[2908.50 - 2913.48] everything I know but that's why I
[2910.78 - 2915.34] always say start where you can customize
[2913.48 - 2916.84] it start with celery juice just
[2915.34 - 2919.00] customize it
[2916.84 - 2920.68] start with something right I tell people
[2919.00 - 2922.18] start with a heavy metal detox smoothie
[2920.68 - 2925.78] start with celery you start with the 20
[2922.18 - 2927.28] day cleanse start with the 369
[2925.78 - 2930.16] you know
[2927.28 - 2933.16] the you know start with a 369 of any
[2930.16 - 2934.96] choice or start with the monocleanse or
[2933.16 - 2937.48] start with the morning cleanse maybe
[2934.96 - 2939.16] just the morning cleanse maybe look at
[2937.48 - 2940.90] the protocols for just your symptom or
[2939.16 - 2942.04] condition take the book to your doctor
[2940.90 - 2943.90] or practitioner your favorite
[2942.04 - 2946.48] practitioner ask them to help you with
[2943.90 - 2948.16] the book all kinds of different things I
[2946.48 - 2950.52] know I tell people a lot of different
[2948.16 - 2950.52] stuff
[2951.06 - 2956.32] when people aren't feeling well
[2953.38 - 2958.84] physically it can be angering
[2956.32 - 2960.16] I mean come on you guys know that come
[2958.84 - 2962.92] on
[2960.16 - 2966.76] MD on YouTube you just have to stay
[2962.92 - 2969.40] steeped in this info and really study it
[2966.76 - 2970.54] gets me emotional because that's what I
[2969.40 - 2973.30] have to do
[2970.54 - 2975.58] like in my own personal experience I
[2973.30 - 2978.94] have to stay steeped in it
[2975.58 - 2981.16] you know because it's a lot of info
[2978.94 - 2983.02] every time Spirit of compassion says we
[2981.16 - 2985.54] have to do another book
[2983.02 - 2987.94] we have to get these Bibles out there
[2985.54 - 2990.76] for people so that they're here 30 years
[2987.94 - 2993.34] from now 40 years from now
[2990.76 - 2994.42] 50 years from now that these books are
[2993.34 - 2996.10] here
[2994.42 - 2998.62] Spirit of compassion is always thinking
[2996.10 - 3000.42] about me being gone someday
[2998.62 - 3003.68] and always like well we have to have
[3000.42 - 3003.68] these Bibles here
[3003.72 - 3007.32] in hopes that even when they're book
[3005.40 - 3011.10] burning down the road
[3007.32 - 3014.34] that these somehow survive
[3011.10 - 3017.46] there's a IG comment there
[3014.34 - 3019.32] see Marcel says celery heavy metal detox
[3017.46 - 3022.38] smoothie and brain shot therapies are
[3019.32 - 3025.08] helping with my caffeine withdrawal feel

[3025.08 - 3029.66] is amazing by the way congratulations
[3031.44 - 3034.58] here's a comment on IG

[3063.84 - 3068.28] that's incredible
[3066.12 - 3069.84] I never judged anybody who smoked weed
[3068.28 - 3071.46] by the way I don't smoke weed but I
[3069.84 - 3073.86] never judge anybody I do fool around
[3071.46 - 3076.22] every now and then and I make a joke and
[3073.86 - 3076.22] I'm like
[3076.68 - 3080.16] I'm like
[3077.82 - 3084.56] this is good stuff man
[3080.16 - 3084.56] let me get it rolled up
[3085.38 - 3090.90] some good buds this is Sage

[3093.17 - 3096.41] [Music]
[3097.02 - 3102.06] this is Sage it's gonna go on our anger
[3100.50 - 3104.40] shifter
[3102.06 - 3107.04] so I could be yep the books need to be
[3104.40 - 3108.66] re-read over and over I'm rereading all
[3107.04 - 3111.66] of them and I amazed at how much I
[3108.66 - 3114.60] forgot muck till Freedom says
[3111.66 - 3116.34] anger is not always bad
[3114.60 - 3120.54] depend
[3116.34 - 3122.94] there is look there is obviously
[3120.54 - 3126.36] a healthy reason
[3122.94 - 3129.54] right to get upset I'm not saying it's
[3126.36 - 3133.50] it's it's bad to be like angry or upset
[3129.54 - 3138.02] that's not it I'm saying though that we
[3133.50 - 3138.02] can't stay in a perpetually angry place
[3138.18 - 3145.44] if we have a spark of anger inside of us
[3142.14 - 3148.14] because we feel we're not justified or
[3145.44 - 3150.30] in Injustice Justice occurred it's a
[3148.14 - 3152.58] natural experience and emotion
[3150.30 - 3154.20] but what's not natural to us is the
[3152.58 - 3158.12] metal inside our brains that gets
[3154.20 - 3158.12] affected from when we have that anger
[3161.10 - 3165.12] and that's the part I'm trying to help
[3162.72 - 3167.58] people with because we got to take care
[3165.12 - 3169.56] of ourselves
[3167.58 - 3171.12] anger can spur
[3169.56 - 3173.88] action
[3171.12 - 3177.18] there is a healthy level of it and I
[3173.88 - 3179.46] know that like I'm pissed off I want to
[3177.18 - 3182.82] do something about that
[3179.46 - 3184.92] but we're talking about when it feels
[3182.82 - 3187.92] like it's past that
[3184.92 - 3191.04] and if anybody wants a healthy small
[3187.92 - 3193.44] bout of anger to propel an action to
[3191.04 - 3196.26] justify something let's get the metals
[3193.44 - 3199.02] out of your brain so they're not melting
[3196.26 - 3201.24] during that process many get stuck in
[3199.02 - 3202.86] constant chronic anger and that's a
[3201.24 - 3204.48] whole nother thing
[3202.86 - 3207.90] when people aren't feeling well
[3204.48 - 3209.70] physically it can be angry is that true
[3207.90 - 3213.02] is that true if you don't feel good
[3209.70 - 3213.02] physically can it be anchoring
[3213.60 - 3218.94] because there's a physical reason not
[3216.48 - 3220.56] just because we want to be angry there's
[3218.94 - 3223.86] a physical reason why we get spurred on
[3220.56 - 3226.68] into mystery chronic anger all the time
[3223.86 - 3228.66] if you're chronically sick plus you're
[3226.68 - 3230.64] also experiencing any of these factors
[3228.66 - 3232.32] trauma heavy metals or an overloaded
[3230.64 - 3234.60] liver
[3232.32 - 3236.16] the feeling of that chronic unwellness
[3234.60 - 3237.78] can act as a trigger for these
[3236.16 - 3239.52] underlying cause of chronic anger if
[3237.78 - 3241.38] you're not feeling good and you got
[3239.52 - 3244.50] Metals in your brain man you could be
[3241.38 - 3247.44] stuck with chronic anger happening in
[3244.50 - 3248.76] your life many get blamed for it not
[3247.44 - 3250.56] managing their motions that's what
[3248.76 - 3252.84] they're blamed for you're not managing
[3250.56 - 3254.76] your emotions
[3252.84 - 3256.62] you're angry because you're not managing
[3254.76 - 3259.32] your emotions you're crappy at managing
[3256.62 - 3261.30] your emotions and it's sad because dude
[3259.32 - 3262.92] you don't know what's inside their head
[3261.30 - 3264.42] you don't know how much metal is inside
[3262.92 - 3266.88] their head and how much trauma they've
[3264.42 - 3269.22] had and everything else
[3266.88 - 3271.08] don't be punishing people because they
[3269.22 - 3272.58] can't manage their emotions don't tell
[3271.08 - 3274.68] them that they're not good at managing
[3272.58 - 3276.48] it
[3274.68 - 3279.12] you think they want to be angry you
[3276.48 - 3281.34] think people want to be angry
[3279.12 - 3283.74] you don't pun you can't punish people
[3281.34 - 3285.12] for being angry I get it that we want we
[3283.74 - 3286.68] want to punish people for being angry
[3285.12 - 3288.48] shouldn't be angry but the point is is
[3286.68 - 3290.70] what if they're really suffering they
[3288.48 - 3292.20] really don't feel good physically what
[3290.70 - 3293.88] if they're that one person that gets
[3292.20 - 3296.04] blamed for not managing their emotions
[3293.88 - 3299.16] right when it's not their fault they got
[3296.04 - 3302.46] they literally have all this this
[3299.16 - 3305.46] trauma and medals and
[3302.46 - 3307.98] their brain needs help
[3305.46 - 3309.66] physically no one knows that their
[3307.98 - 3312.78] electrolytes are down their metals are
[3309.66 - 3315.32] actually causing problems nobody knows
[3312.78 - 3315.32] foreign
[3318.86 - 3324.00] problem that hasn't been addressed
[3321.96 - 3325.14] they can't
[3324.00 - 3326.58] think
[3325.14 - 3329.10] yourself
[3326.58 - 3331.56] out of that
[3329.10 - 3333.06] it's hard to think yourself out of that
[3331.56 - 3334.86] if you have a physical problem that's
[3333.06 - 3338.58] not being addressed you can't just wheel
[3334.86 - 3340.32] yourself out of that so easy I'm gonna
[3338.58 - 3342.98] I'm gonna try to think myself out of
[3340.32 - 3342.98] this so fast
[3343.02 - 3347.22] so we're doing the anchor shifter
[3345.36 - 3348.68] because that
[3347.22 - 3351.06] has
[3348.68 - 3352.86] phytochemical compounds synergistically
[3351.06 - 3354.12] working together to hit the emotional
[3352.86 - 3355.74] centers of the brain to help somebody
[3354.12 - 3357.78] get relief while they're fixing other
[3355.74 - 3359.88] problems
[3357.78 - 3362.34] homely said all the anger management
[3359.88 - 3364.32] classes not based on real knowledge
[3362.34 - 3366.12] exactly it's not like you go into your
[3364.32 - 3369.74] anger management class and they're like
[3366.12 - 3369.74] well Mr Ferguson
[3370.38 - 3373.74] I know you're really angry because
[3372.00 - 3376.86] you've been on the toilet constipated
[3373.74 - 3379.44] every day you can't go to bathroom Mrs
[3376.86 - 3381.78] Ferguson made you come in because you're
[3379.44 - 3384.12] angry every day
[3381.78 - 3386.52] so we're going to try to rethink
[3384.12 - 3388.56] you out of this
[3386.52 - 3390.48] Mr Ferguson's like I can't go to
[3388.56 - 3393.72] bathroom that's why I'm angry I'm on the
[3390.48 - 3396.90] toilet for four hours a day trying to
[3393.72 - 3399.48] push out of bowel movement
[3396.90 - 3401.40] that's why I'm frustrated and angry well
[3399.48 - 3404.06] we can rethink this differently Mr
[3401.40 - 3404.06] Ferguson
[3409.38 - 3416.94] you said Mr Ferguson twice today hmm

[3931.74 - 3935.00] least I swear to God
[3937.80 - 3944.10] use this anger shifter
[3940.56 - 3947.58] if your anger is towards yourself
[3944.10 - 3950.16] if you're angry at yourself
[3947.58 - 3952.50] use the anger shifter if you're pissed
[3950.16 - 3953.58] off at yourself
[3952.50 - 3956.94] which
[3953.58 - 3959.76] I get pissed off at myself periodically
[3956.94 - 3961.56] I'll be like geez aw
[3959.76 - 3963.54] and the anger shifter is definitely
[3961.56 - 3965.82] satisfying there's two books right here
[3963.54 - 3968.76] you're gonna want both of them they're
[3965.82 - 3972.18] both critical it was one book how to be
[3968.76 - 3974.04] put into two big Bibles
[3972.18 - 3975.36] people are asking about the books right
[3974.04 - 3977.22] now that's why I'm mentioning it they're
[3975.36 - 3979.68] saying which book do I get well there's

[3979.68 - 3983.46] one brain saver you need them both it's
[3981.48 - 3986.94] critical take a look when you get a
[3983.46 - 3988.98] chance if you're in the U.S oh my God

[3993.42 - 3997.26] something but incredible the pricing's
[3995.88 - 4000.32] insane

[4000.32 - 4007.40] when you start reading the brain saver
[4002.12 - 4009.26] books you can't go back to the

[4092.60 - 4095.26] foreign
[4095.38 - 4102.62] cup of mint fresh mint tightly packed
[4100.88 - 4105.32] let's do it
[4102.62 - 4108.98] and listen I wasn't making fun of
[4105.32 - 4111.86] anybody who's using weed I realized that
[4108.98 - 4113.48] most people using weed are really just
[4111.86 - 4115.46] hurting bad
[4113.48 - 4117.26] emotionally and physically they have
[4115.46 - 4119.36] real physical problems wrong with their
[4117.26 - 4122.12] brain and they're using the weed to
[4119.36 - 4124.90] medicate and I'm not making fun of them
[4122.12 - 4124.90] I'm not
[4127.16 - 4131.56] um
[4128.78 - 4131.56] I'm not
[4132.50 - 4137.48] I got a friend named Bryce
[4134.96 - 4139.16] and Bryce is totally stoned every day
[4137.48 - 4142.66] out of his mind
[4139.16 - 4142.66] and he sits on his couch
[4143.12 - 4146.32] his wife left him
[4148.34 - 4152.78] tightly packed just a half cup so I'm
[4150.32 - 4154.64] putting a decent amount of uh French
[4152.78 - 4157.04] fresh mint in here
[4154.64 - 4160.00] so anyway Bryce's my friend Bryce his
[4157.04 - 4160.00] wife left him
[4164.18 - 4168.02] this is a real story though by the way
[4166.22 - 4169.52] even though you know how I come on here
[4168.02 - 4171.38] as rice right
[4169.52 - 4173.54] but it's a real story though I do have a
[4171.38 - 4175.58] friend and
[4173.54 - 4177.26] he didn't do anything but smoked weed on
[4175.58 - 4180.68] the couch
[4177.26 - 4183.02] and his wife just walked in one day
[4180.68 - 4185.78] the pizza boxes were everywhere and his
[4183.02 - 4188.80] wife walked in and said
[4185.78 - 4188.80] I'm out of here
[4193.40 - 4197.60] all right we got some mint in there
[4195.38 - 4201.04] incredible quarter cup tightly Pat
[4197.60 - 4201.04] packed fresh Sage
[4204.74 - 4211.06] and he doesn't know he doesn't know why
[4207.38 - 4211.06] it happened and I told him
[4211.10 - 4217.12] there's only so many years when you're
[4214.16 - 4220.04] finally out of college
[4217.12 - 4222.44] that you can just smoke weed every day
[4220.04 - 4224.96] and every night or every night where
[4222.44 - 4227.18] chances are
[4224.96 - 4228.68] your girlfriend or your wife is just
[4227.18 - 4230.66] going to be like I can't take this
[4228.68 - 4232.34] anymore
[4230.66 - 4234.44] this is going to be really strong this
[4232.34 - 4235.76] anger shifter man it's just gonna be
[4234.44 - 4237.74] strong
[4235.76 - 4239.90] I'm actually scared on how strong this
[4237.74 - 4241.58] is going to be maybe that's a good thing
[4239.90 - 4244.30] I'm actually spooked this thing's gonna
[4241.58 - 4244.30] be Wicked
[4246.38 - 4251.06] that's a lot of sage I put in there but
[4249.02 - 4252.38] it's tightly packed and it's it's from
[4251.06 - 4253.76] it's going to be tightly packed because
[4252.38 - 4255.74] I kind of measured into what I'm going
[4253.76 - 4258.98] to do that's not usually up to you so
[4255.74 - 4262.06] much I know half cup of fresh or thawed
[4258.98 - 4262.06] frozen mango
[4263.84 - 4267.92] all right
[4265.16 - 4269.84] it's common on IG right now is the Omega
[4267.92 - 4272.36] Juicer from Amazon
[4269.84 - 4273.56] the same as the one from Omega go to the
[4272.36 - 4276.44] Omega company
[4273.56 - 4278.00] okay because it's not on sale on Amazon
[4276.44 - 4279.74] I got to shut this down because I'm
[4278.00 - 4281.48] worried someone's gonna get the juicer
[4279.74 - 4284.36] and it's not gonna be on sale the mm
[4281.48 - 4286.52] 1500 and the mm900 are on sale at Omega
[4284.36 - 4287.90] juicers.com the link is in the
[4286.52 - 4290.60] description the link is in the profile
[4287.90 - 4292.16] see mm 1500 is what I'm using it's an
[4290.60 - 4293.84] incredible juicer it's cold pressed
[4292.16 - 4297.44] masticating juicer that actually
[4293.84 - 4299.30] squeezes more juice out of the produce
[4297.44 - 4301.22] so you save money and if you're juicing
[4299.30 - 4303.98] celery every day and you're juicing
[4301.22 - 4305.90] celery and greens and all that your pulp
[4303.98 - 4308.30] comes out dry
[4305.90 - 4311.00] and you're saving all this money it's
[4308.30 - 4312.26] really really incredible right so it
[4311.00 - 4315.14] pays for itself there's people that
[4312.26 - 4317.48] claim they're saving 80 a week 100 a
[4315.14 - 4318.80] week on produce fifty dollars a week on
[4317.48 - 4321.56] produce eighty dollars a month on
[4318.80 - 4323.48] produce it's incredible
[4321.56 - 4325.22] um look what it got out of these herbs
[4323.48 - 4328.88] okay I'm just gonna show you do you guys
[4325.22 - 4332.06] okay this is really critical to know
[4328.88 - 4335.24] I Juiced some mint
[4332.06 - 4340.06] I Juiced some Sage
[4335.24 - 4340.06] I didn't even juice the stems okay
[4340.58 - 4346.82] okay that's super dry right there
[4344.24 - 4350.60] the pulp
[4346.82 - 4352.28] and look how much juice I got out of two
[4350.60 - 4355.28] herbs
[4352.28 - 4359.48] you can't get juice out of herbs
[4355.28 - 4362.18] it's so hard you need more and more with
[4359.48 - 4363.62] other juicers this is incredible what
[4362.18 - 4367.64] this does
[4363.62 - 4370.42] the warranty is 15 years including Parts
[4367.64 - 4373.28] 15 years
[4370.42 - 4375.86] it's insane
[4373.28 - 4377.18] anyway you can't buy it on Amazon you
[4375.86 - 4379.88] buy it on Amazon you don't get the
[4377.18 - 4382.04] discount it's on sale right now
[4379.88 - 4385.04] just saying all right let's go let's get
[4382.04 - 4387.44] moving let's do the Frozen mango next
[4385.04 - 4389.54] that's why I endorse these juicers and
[4387.44 - 4391.10] work with these guys because of the food
[4389.54 - 4393.74] prices going up
[4391.10 - 4397.76] I predicted the food prices were going
[4393.74 - 4399.44] up I predicted it years ago before they
[4397.76 - 4401.48] went up
[4399.44 - 4404.06] and so
[4401.48 - 4407.30] what was incredible about this juicer
[4404.06 - 4410.72] was that very thing because it it helped
[4407.30 - 4414.64] remedy it helped to do something to the
[4410.72 - 4414.64] food pricing that was going up okay
[4414.86 - 4418.76] so it's really incredible
[4416.96 - 4421.18] all right so I think I need some carrot
[4418.76 - 4421.18] decks
[4421.22 - 4426.32] so
[4422.96 - 4427.64] now the blueberry juice
[4426.32 - 4429.08] I'm gonna put some blueberries you can
[4427.64 - 4430.70] do the wild blueberries the Frozen wild
[4429.08 - 4432.74] blueberries right the Wyman's Frozen
[4430.70 - 4435.88] wild blueberries I'm just going to add
[4432.74 - 4435.88] some blueberry juice in here
[4436.34 - 4442.48] fit exact amount
[4438.86 - 4442.48] I've got a little touch of that in there
[4442.58 - 4445.52] so I didn't put the Frozen wild
[4443.96 - 4447.86] blueberries in this time I'm just using
[4445.52 - 4451.24] the juice in there because you can
[4447.86 - 4451.24] it says it in the book
[4452.84 - 4456.02] so now I'm going to look at this carrot
[4454.76 - 4461.92] here
[4456.02 - 4461.92] and it says one cup of chopped carrots
[4462.20 - 4465.88] one cup of chopped carrots
[4477.44 - 4482.12] foreign
[4479.30 - 4483.92] you guys I really love doing
[4482.12 - 4485.78] this with you guys

[4485.78 - 4491.96] anchor shifter if you just got on here
[4488.36 - 4493.34] we don't close these challenges off from
[4491.96 - 4495.68] the public
[4493.34 - 4497.18] the problem with that is people from the
[4495.68 - 4499.46] public come on and they go what the hell
[4497.18 - 4500.78] is he doing what is this what's
[4499.46 - 4503.84] happening
[4500.78 - 4505.58] this is a free challenge I won't close
[4503.84 - 4507.92] it off to the public
[4505.58 - 4509.72] in charge
[4507.92 - 4511.58] it's free
[4509.72 - 4513.62] I don't want to charge for that charge
[4511.58 - 4515.96] for programs subscription fees on the
[4513.62 - 4517.76] website I don't do any of that
[4515.96 - 4520.22] much
[4517.76 - 4522.44] no commercials in front of my podcast no
[4520.22 - 4525.44] advertising in front of my podcast
[4522.44 - 4527.12] so I'm doing uh some carrots
[4525.44 - 4529.24] cup of carrots gonna do a little bit
[4527.12 - 4529.24] more
[4533.90 - 4538.28] some more carrot
[4536.66 - 4540.70] are you guys doing it with me or just
[4538.28 - 4540.70] watching
[4542.00 - 4549.02] let's see I used to be Bryce so grateful
[4545.96 - 4552.08] for the medical medium info that healed
[4549.02 - 4554.66] and I can be a free person for my family
[4552.08 - 4557.90] and for myself incredible incredible
[4554.66 - 4557.90] America amazing
[4559.22 - 4562.24] all right we're good
[4562.52 - 4566.24] now what you want to do because of the
[4564.26 - 4568.04] high compression in here that sometimes
[4566.24 - 4569.60] when you use something like mango it's a
[4568.04 - 4572.00] little softer it takes time to go down
[4569.60 - 4573.68] you can spend a little time have a
[4572.00 - 4576.34] little patience and it'll go down and
[4573.68 - 4576.34] you can push it down
[4577.28 - 4581.18] but that high compression makes it so
[4579.20 - 4582.26] when you do juicing when you're juicing
[4581.18 - 4584.48] juicing
[4582.26 - 4586.58] man the amount of money you save is just
[4584.48 - 4588.08] incredible
[4586.58 - 4591.38] and you can't say that with other
[4588.08 - 4593.66] juicers amazing what you'll find is the
[4591.38 - 4595.48] pulp doesn't come out sloppy wet where
[4593.66 - 4597.98] all your money's thrown out the window
[4595.48 - 4600.44] it's thrown out the window with a lot of
[4597.98 - 4602.12] juicers because the pulp is sloppy wet
[4600.44 - 4603.74] as it's coming out that's all your juice
[4602.12 - 4604.94] so you have to put a lot more in you
[4603.74 - 4606.86] don't have to do that with the medical
[4604.94 - 4610.94] medium
[4606.86 - 4614.24] um the mm-1500 and 900 that pulp is dry
[4610.94 - 4617.20] like dust dry nothing wet in there it's
[4614.24 - 4617.20] on sale you guys
[4617.78 - 4622.52] all right so we got a juice right here I
[4620.18 - 4625.96] got a lot more than I bargained for in
[4622.52 - 4625.96] that one though I have to say
[4626.90 - 4630.28] let's get a shot glass out
[4635.42 - 4639.32] all right

[4639.32 - 4642.86] I'm ready for it
