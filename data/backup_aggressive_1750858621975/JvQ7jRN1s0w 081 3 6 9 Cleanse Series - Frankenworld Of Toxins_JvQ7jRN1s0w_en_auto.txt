[1.28 - 7.72] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.72 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.56] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.48 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.56 - 25.88] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.40 - 28.44] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.88 - 31.24] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.24 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 44.96] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 47.84] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[44.96 - 50.60] William we're talking about the 369
[47.84 - 53.20] cleanse there's never been a more
[50.60 - 55.96] important time in history to cleanse
[53.20 - 57.60] than now if you're somebody that doesn't
[55.96 - 59.24] feel well and you got all kinds of
[57.60 - 60.88] different symptoms and conditions and
[59.24 - 63.40] you've been struggling
[60.88 - 65.84] you might want to think about cleansing
[63.40 - 68.48] but not just cleansing cleansing with
[65.84 - 71.80] something that has worked and has
[68.48 - 74.44] already saved lives not just one life
[71.80 - 76.60] but thousands of lives and let's be
[74.44 - 79.36] clear about something this isn't a
[76.60 - 81.72]  expensive program sales pitch a
[79.36 - 83.80] nasty dirty pyramid scheme in health for
[81.72 - 85.84] a water machine this isn't a biohack
[83.80 - 88.36] game to sell you a bunch of trendy
[85.84 - 90.52] things like collagen and this ain't no
[88.36 - 94.76] probiotic gut health micro mob biome
[90.52 - 98.48] feal implant ice bath bone broth charade
[94.76 - 101.28] this is the 369 cleanse you could walk
[98.48 - 103.60] right into your local library and say
[101.28 - 106.52] hey do you guys have a copy of cleanse
[103.60 - 108.88] to heal that I could borrow the 369
[106.52 - 112.28] cleanse has pulled people out of living
[108.88 - 114.12] hell and back back to life from Lyme
[112.28 - 116.84] disease multiple sclerosis severe
[114.12 - 119.44] depression migraines anxiety taking
[116.84 - 121.80] people out of wheelchairs getting them
[119.44 - 124.92] to walk walk again and getting their
[121.80 - 128.40] lives to where it used to be quality of
[124.92 - 130.92] life and how does the 369 do this by
[128.40 - 133.84] removing things out of our bodies that
[130.92 - 137.32] should not be there toxins that thicken
[133.84 - 140.56] our blood filled with modern day poisons
[137.32 - 143.24] that never wash away until we do
[140.56 - 143.24] something about
[144.16 - 149.00] it yeah I'm in my favorite coffee shop
[146.56 - 151.20] right now yeah yeah just chilling out
[149.00 - 153.24] working trying to get some things done
[151.20 - 155.48] God I'm looking outside right now in the
[153.24 - 158.44] window I should take a video of this
[155.48 - 161.16] this is crazy it's just endless streaks
[158.44 - 165.16] in this guy like here I'll count for you
[161.16 - 166.60] like it's crazy it's 1 two three 4 8 9
[165.16 - 172.28] 10 11
[166.60 - 174.76] 12 17 18 19 21 this there's got to be 50
[172.28 - 177.72] or 60 of them up there why am I freaking
[174.76 - 179.32] out I don't know but all I know is I see
[177.72 - 181.12] them every now and then but this is like
[179.32 - 183.12] getting out of control like why are they
[181.12 - 185.96] doing this it's like planes I think it's
[183.12 - 187.68] like planes yeah I'm just going to stand
[185.96 - 189.28] by the door right here I need some fresh
[187.68 - 191.24] air anyway I've been in the coffee shop
[189.28 - 194.04] for a little bit let me just take a deep
[191.24 - 197.48] breath out here it's a nice
[194.04 - 199.52] day crisp air but I just can't get over
[197.48 - 204.64] these Trails up there do you think that
[199.52 - 208.76] stuff is like falling down on us I don't
[204.64 - 210.36] know I remember at the beginning of Co
[208.76 - 213.84] the streets were
[210.36 - 215.16] quiet I was on the highway and there was
[213.84 - 219.60] no
[215.16 - 223.00] traffic in fact I drove two miles and
[219.60 - 225.48] did not pass a car on the other side I
[223.00 - 230.40] remember hearing and seeing information
[225.48 - 234.08] out there streets were dead dead empty
[230.40 - 235.64] streets in cities were dead empty people
[234.08 - 237.72] were leaving their
[235.64 - 240.36] houses they were trying to get to a
[237.72 - 242.92] store then quickly back home
[240.36 - 245.48] and not too many people were traveling
[242.92 - 249.00] air traffic was minimal for commercial
[245.48 - 251.96] flights but guess what there were
[249.00 - 255.20] thousands of planes in the sky thousands
[251.96 - 258.08] all around the planet millions of planes
[255.20 - 261.20] in the sky you can look up in the sky
[258.08 - 262.84] and you can see 10 20 planes but guess
[261.20 - 264.72] what there weren't passengers on those
[262.84 - 267.32] planes they were chemtrail
[264.72 - 270.24] planes here the world seemed like it was
[267.32 - 272.68] ending down on the street
[270.24 - 275.72] it was ending in people's homes people
[272.68 - 276.80] were in fear they were scared no one was
[275.72 - 280.24] leaving their
[276.80 - 283.08] houses and up in the sky they were
[280.24 - 284.56] flying planes every single day every
[283.08 - 286.24] minute you can look up and you'll see
[284.56 - 288.08] them and the streaks were there the
[286.24 - 291.64] Chemtrails were there it was like
[288.08 - 294.96] nothing was stopping as far as
[291.64 - 297.72] evildoers nothing was stopping as far as
[294.96 - 301.36] the satanic cult behind the chemtrail
[297.72 - 304.48] movement evil was up high in the sky
[301.36 - 306.56] that's right evil was in the plains
[304.48 - 309.12] that's right chemicals being dumped on
[306.56 - 313.08] everybody day in and day out all night
[309.12 - 315.12] long all day long it wasn't halting you
[313.08 - 317.68] would think it would be nothing was
[315.12 - 320.60] happening everything was basically at a
[317.68 - 323.48] standstill the Chemtrails kept on coming
[320.60 - 326.68] and coming and coming heavier than ever
[323.48 - 329.76] before Darkness was above us dropping
[326.68 - 333.16] stuff on us and darkness was around us
[329.76 - 335.68] spreading stuff on us the manufacturing
[333.16 - 339.24] of the viruses the lab
[335.68 - 341.20] viruses the manufacturing engineering of
[339.24 - 343.12] viruses something that's been happening
[341.20 - 345.76] for over a hundred years classified
[343.12 - 347.80] medical research and Science Why do you
[345.76 - 350.32] think everybody's just sick out there
[347.80 - 352.60] they're filled with viruses of all kinds
[350.32 - 354.16] but during this time way up in the sky
[352.60 - 356.96] they were assaulting
[354.16 - 359.72] us who hired those millions of Pilots to
[356.96 - 362.44] drop all that chem on us nobody know
[359.72 - 364.40] knows interesting but they were
[362.44 - 366.84] assaulting us up there while assaulting
[364.40 - 369.36] us down here with engineered viruses
[366.84 - 372.40] like Co and maybe you remember this
[369.36 - 376.12] maybe you don't but right before Co
[372.40 - 379.52] there was an engineered flu a flu virus
[376.12 - 381.28] that ripped across the cities ripped
[379.52 - 384.16] across the United States around the
[381.28 - 387.12] world it injured a lot of people and a
[384.16 - 390.08] lot of people died from it it was a bad
[387.12 - 393.08] bad bad flu that was engineering
[390.08 - 395.72] that was released even before Co only a
[393.08 - 398.60] couple of months before Co so why am I
[395.72 - 400.88] talking about this all of it project
[398.60 - 404.12] Chemtrails started in the
[400.88 - 406.56] 1960s and it's still here today and
[404.12 - 408.76] these Chemtrails are composed of every
[406.56 - 411.84] toxin possible that the chemical
[408.76 - 415.40] industry creates this includes toxic
[411.84 - 418.12] heavy metals Mercury copper it's also
[415.40 - 420.24] including outdated Antiquated chemical
[418.12 - 423.56] storage bins that have been backlogged
[420.24 - 427.84] in storage for decades chemical waste
[423.56 - 431.04] that has sat in tanks for 50 60 70 or 80
[427.84 - 434.20] in even 100 years it's a combination of
[431.04 - 437.32] chemicals both old and new being placed
[434.20 - 439.04] in planes and dumped out of the sky when
[437.32 - 441.24] the Los Angeles fires were at their
[439.04 - 443.24] height days ago because they're still
[441.24 - 445.60] burning now when they were at their
[443.24 - 448.00] height Chemtrails were being dropped
[445.60 - 450.56] everywhere chemtrail planes were flying
[448.00 - 454.00] above dropping chemtrails over Los
[450.56 - 456.68] Angeles as the fires were raging the
[454.00 - 459.56] people behind the Chemtrails are above
[456.68 - 462.32] even the most powerful public figures
[459.56 - 464.84] and above the people who seem to run
[462.32 - 467.60] every country in the world the chemtrail
[464.84 - 470.12] hierarchy are not on the Forbes list
[467.60 - 472.28] it's the secret society of Doom they're
[470.12 - 474.56] behind engineering the viruses that
[472.28 - 476.64] spread around the world which there are
[474.56 - 478.72] more to come and they're going to be
[476.64 - 480.92] worse than the ones before and they're
[478.72 - 483.40] also behind all the chemicals falling
[480.92 - 486.12] out of the sky out of the Plains onto
[483.40 - 489.36] everyone if someone was just to say give
[486.12 - 492.48] me one good reason to cleanse I just
[489.36 - 495.80] gave you two pathogens love toxins
[492.48 - 497.64] pathogens eat and feed off of toxins the
[495.80 - 499.12] more toxins and the chemicals and
[497.64 - 502.32] everything else that we have inside of
[499.12 - 505.56] our body the more these bugs that stay
[502.32 - 508.84] dormant inside of us can wake up and
[505.56 - 510.04] feed and grow into something and turn
[508.84 - 512.68] into sick
[510.04 - 515.00] turn our bodies into sickness we keep
[512.68 - 517.88] the toxins away from the pathogens that
[515.00 - 520.36] are inside of us and we Empower
[517.88 - 523.00] ourselves if someone's battling
[520.36 - 525.56] autoimmune they're battling toxins and
[523.00 - 528.12] pathogens pathogens feeding off of
[525.56 - 529.84] toxins or they're battling a small
[528.12 - 532.44] amount of pathogens and a large amount
[529.84 - 535.00] of toxins the more toxins inside our
[532.44 - 538.28] body the more chances we can catch
[535.00 - 541.12] something the second the minute a bug
[538.28 - 542.64] enters us through exposure of some kind
[541.12 - 545.60] whether it's on the handle of a shopping
[542.64 - 547.48] cart Carriage whether it's in a bathroom
[545.60 - 550.08] a public bathroom on a toilet seat in
[547.48 - 551.92] the toilet water or by the sink whether
[550.08 - 553.84] it's somebody that you had a sexual
[551.92 - 556.24] encounter with whether it's bodily
[553.84 - 558.64] fluids on a glass that you drank out of
[556.24 - 561.80] that were somebody else's in any way
[558.64 - 564.80] shape or form when we get a new bug it's
[561.80 - 567.84] damage and danger to us depends on how
[564.80 - 570.72] toxic we are that means if we have what
[567.84 - 573.64] the bug needs so it can proliferate so
[570.72 - 576.96] it can actually expand so it can grow so
[573.64 - 579.44] it can multiply it needs toxins to do so
[576.96 - 581.28] it needs fuel and the more toxins we
[579.44 - 584.40] have inside of our body the more
[581.28 - 587.32] aggressive the pathogen can get and what
[584.40 - 589.28] about our immune system immune systems
[587.32 - 591.76] struggle when there's a lot of toxins in
[589.28 - 594.64] the body the more toxins we have in our
[591.76 - 597.04] body our brain our liver or spleen our
[594.64 - 599.48] pancreas or intestinal tract the more
[597.04 - 602.40] toxins we have inside of our tissue or
[599.48 - 605.00] cells or organs the more our immune
[602.40 - 608.36] system struggles and weakens because our
[605.00 - 611.20] immune system goes up against the toxins
[608.36 - 615.44] our immune system tries to gobble up the
[611.20 - 619.44] toxins our immune cells actually go up
[615.44 - 622.56] against the toxin consume it try to rid
[619.44 - 624.52] it try to stop it because it's a free
[622.56 - 627.12] radical it shouldn't be in the body and
[624.52 - 629.60] our immune systems know this but when
[627.12 - 631.76] our immune systems are busy trying to go
[629.60 - 635.24] after metals and all kinds of other
[631.76 - 640.52] toxins our immune system cells burst
[635.24 - 642.32] they weaken they get dried out they die
[640.52 - 644.40] and with the more exposure we get with
[642.32 - 646.60] the toxins and the toxins building up in
[644.40 - 649.12] every single cell in our body our immune
[646.60 - 651.56] system start to weaken pathogens take
[649.12 - 654.76] advantage of this they feed off the
[651.56 - 656.56] toxins not only feed off the toxins but
[654.76 - 658.76] they don't have an immune system to
[656.56 - 661.40] really battle against so they grow
[658.76 - 664.60] rapidly and then everything is
[661.40 - 667.52] fast-tracked every Cancer every disease
[664.60 - 670.04] every illness mach five cancers are
[667.52 - 673.60] prime example of pathogens feeding off
[670.04 - 677.20] of toxins and then creating cancer
[673.60 - 680.12] pathogens feeding off of toxins toxins
[677.20 - 682.88] feeding the pathogens viral cells
[680.12 - 685.04] becoming cancer cells so there's never
[682.88 - 687.96] been a more important time for getting
[685.04 - 692.16] rid of toxins and if we don't our bodies
[687.96 - 696.44] become the bath tub they become that old
[692.16 - 699.24] moldy rotten stinky bathtub and tiles
[696.44 - 702.32] filled with mold our blood gets thick
[699.24 - 704.64] our liver gets toxic stagnant it gets
[702.32 - 706.32] overworked overburdened it's not
[704.64 - 708.44] functioning like it should our
[706.32 - 710.72] intestinal tract gets all kinds of
[708.44 - 712.92] different buildup Linings of the
[710.72 - 715.24] intestinal tract and colon start to
[712.92 - 717.92] Harbor things that shouldn't be there
[715.24 - 720.16] it's not just toxins but it's a buildup
[717.92 - 722.44] of sludge and toxin
[720.16 - 724.72] along with different pathogens that
[722.44 - 727.72] start to make a home there our brains
[724.72 - 730.88] get dirty our brain cells die our brain
[727.72 - 733.28] tissue oxidizes we don't have enough
[730.88 - 736.00] antioxidants we don't have enough
[733.28 - 738.72] detoxifiers we don't cleanse enough and
[736.00 - 741.32] the buildup grows and it grows our
[738.72 - 743.64] brains start to hold things that it
[741.32 - 747.28] should never hold and what's making us
[743.64 - 749.52] so toxic viruses and viral waste matter
[747.28 - 752.28] Pharmaceuticals toxic heavy metals
[749.52 - 754.84] fragrances of all kinds bacteria and
[752.28 - 757.48] other microbes chemical industry
[754.84 - 760.16] domestic Invaders chemical neuro anagon
[757.48 - 762.48] ists petrochemicals and solvents
[760.16 - 765.32] Chemtrails and rainfall exposure
[762.48 - 768.36] radiation EMF harmful food and
[765.32 - 770.72] supplement chemicals harmful supplements
[768.36 - 773.56] harmful foods this is just scratching
[770.72 - 777.04] the surface and everyone is reaching
[773.56 - 779.76] their brain saturation limitation when
[777.04 - 782.64] exposure is small tiny
[779.76 - 785.04] an occasional here and there you may not
[782.64 - 787.56] react or experience symptoms if you are
[785.04 - 789.84] not a sensitive someone may be on a
[787.56 - 792.88] pharmaceutical for a month or a
[789.84 - 795.04] pharmaceutical for 10 years someone may
[792.88 - 797.52] be exposed to fumes for a few minutes at
[795.04 - 800.44] a gasoline pump or they have some
[797.52 - 802.44] gasoline spilled on their skin someone
[800.44 - 805.16] can be breathing in the fumes and get
[802.44 - 807.24] affected someone may not in the moment
[805.16 - 809.68] everybody has different exposures and
[807.24 - 812.56] symptoms to the exposures but all of
[809.68 - 815.32] this can penetrate the brain the brain
[812.56 - 817.76] has its saturation limits and people on
[815.32 - 820.80] this planet are experiencing that right
[817.76 - 823.32] now when we get exposed to toxins when
[820.80 - 826.24] toxins actually enter us they are
[823.32 - 828.44] usually attached to Metals this is how
[826.24 - 831.76] we get Mercury toxic copper aluminum
[828.44 - 835.84] lead cadmium barium nickel arsenic toxic
[831.76 - 839.80] calcium toxic chromium strontium uranium
[835.84 - 843.24] toxic iron toxic Platinum titanium tin
[839.80 - 845.60] inside of us we get these in us because
[843.24 - 847.12] they're attached to other toxins what a
[845.60 - 849.60] lot of people experience out there in
[847.12 - 853.04] the cleanse world the detox world is
[849.60 - 855.44] surface detoxing surface detoxing is
[853.04 - 858.04] getting rid of some of the Overflow some
[855.44 - 860.48] of the daily overflow their livers are
[858.04 - 862.60] clogged up their brains are clogged up
[860.48 - 865.44] their organs are clogged up but they're
[862.60 - 868.52] getting some of the lymphatic cloggage
[865.44 - 871.44] out but that just gets refilled so what
[868.52 - 875.32] happens is surface detoxing is different
[871.44 - 877.24] than deep cleansing deep detoxing
[875.32 - 878.96] surface detoxing won't be enough for
[877.24 - 881.44] somebody who's truly suffering with a
[878.96 - 885.28] chronic illness someone who has a high
[881.44 - 887.92] pathogen load a high toxic load lowgrade
[885.28 - 890.72] viral infections high-grade viral
[887.92 - 893.16] infections surface detoxing can be
[890.72 - 895.24] helpful but not enough and it might not
[893.16 - 897.68] even be the right kind of surface
[895.24 - 900.84] detoxing cleanses can't just be
[897.68 - 903.44] cleansing they have to be nourishing but
[900.84 - 905.68] not just the word nourishing it can't be
[903.44 - 907.76] just like this cleanse is nourishing it
[905.68 - 911.20] brings nutrients it has to be even more
[907.76 - 913.84] than that it has to be wired wired to
[911.20 - 916.60] repair a damaged sensitive nervous
[913.84 - 919.92] system toxins not only have to be
[916.60 - 922.16] excavated but tissue has to be repaired
[919.92 - 924.88] we have to bring the person back a
[922.16 - 927.48] cleanse needs to do that it has to be
[924.88 - 929.76] set so the person has every chance of
[927.48 - 932.00] fighting an illness every chance of
[929.76 - 934.52] recovery and what happens out there is
[932.00 - 937.24] cleanses aren't Geared for that it's all
[934.52 - 940.12] biohacks hit or miss and then the
[937.24 - 942.68] person's body doesn't truly go all the
[940.12 - 944.72] way with the healing process because
[942.68 - 948.08] first of all the cleanses and detoxes
[944.72 - 949.72] out there weren't built upon the
[948.08 - 952.28] understanding of why the person was
[949.72 - 955.52] really sick to begin with it wasn't
[952.28 - 958.12] built on the realization or the knowing
[955.52 - 960.36] about pathogens what kind of pathogens
[958.12 - 962.84] which ones which varieties what are they
[960.36 - 965.16] feeding on how sick people can really
[962.84 - 967.24] get from that and the process of what
[965.16 - 969.12] metals and other toxins do is they sit
[967.24 - 971.32] inside brain tissue and other organs in
[969.12 - 974.32] the body and what about the immune
[971.32 - 977.12] system cleanses aren't built to repair
[974.32 - 979.00] the immune system they're also not built
[977.12 - 980.92] to understand how the immune system
[979.00 - 983.44] works in regards to what you're even
[980.92 - 986.72] cleansing or how we got sick to begin
[983.44 - 989.28] with a cleanse has to understand all of
[986.72 - 991.88] this what that means is that when the
[989.28 - 994.28] cleanse enters the body whatever that
[991.88 - 996.32] cleanse is there has to be an
[994.28 - 999.56] understanding of exactly what the body
[996.32 - 1003.20] needs what is the person fighting what
[999.56 - 1006.28] are they struggling from what toxins how
[1003.20 - 1009.32] do these toxins get out of tissue how do
[1006.28 - 1011.60] the adrenal stay protected how does the
[1009.32 - 1015.08] liver function while it's under a
[1011.60 - 1017.24] cleanse all of this matters and that
[1015.08 - 1019.68] makes the difference to someone healing
[1017.24 - 1022.28] and someone not to someone actually
[1019.68 - 1024.80] getting their lives back and someone not
[1022.28 - 1028.88] and someone rising out of the ashes
[1024.80 - 1031.52] recovering and someone not 369 cleanse
[1028.88 - 1035.72] cleanses the body while protecting the
[1031.52 - 1038.76] brain from atrophy unlike water fasting
[1035.72 - 1041.60] a long water fast atrophies the brain
[1038.76 - 1044.92] you lose critical nutrients in the brain
[1041.60 - 1047.76] critical minerals glycogen storage Old
[1044.92 - 1049.96] glucose storage disappears and it's hard
[1047.76 - 1052.28] to get any of that back back getting
[1049.96 - 1055.40] nutrients back into the brain takes
[1052.28 - 1058.96] years it's not easy to do especially if
[1055.40 - 1063.00] you're not 10 years old 12 years old or
[1058.96 - 1066.00] a baby or 20 years old but you're 40 or
[1063.00 - 1068.20] 50 if you're 40 and 50 years old and you
[1066.00 - 1070.88] lose all these nutrients all that
[1068.20 - 1072.76] glycogen storage all the trace minerals
[1070.88 - 1075.00] all the neurotransmitter chemicals out
[1072.76 - 1076.96] of the brain because of a very long
[1075.00 - 1080.76] water fast thinking you're cleansing the
[1076.96 - 1083.08] body we get in big trouble we have to
[1080.76 - 1085.08] protect the brain while cleansing that's
[1083.08 - 1087.68] the biggest and most important thing to
[1085.08 - 1090.16] do making sure you're feeding the brain
[1087.68 - 1092.56] lots of glucose lots of trace minerals
[1090.16 - 1094.12] and that's what the 369 cleanse does
[1092.56 - 1096.36] another thing that goes terribly wrong
[1094.12 - 1098.76] with cleanses out there is feeding
[1096.36 - 1101.88] pathogens take the milk cleanse for an
[1098.76 - 1104.04] example the dairy cleanse what happens
[1101.88 - 1105.64] is that pathogens feed off of dairy
[1104.04 - 1107.64] doesn't matter if the dairy's raw
[1105.64 - 1109.56] doesn't matter what kind of dairy
[1107.64 - 1115.16] pathogens viruses Epstein bar the
[1109.56 - 1118.16] shingles hhv6 hh7 the simplexes all feed
[1115.16 - 1121.32] on Dairy so the person thinks they're
[1118.16 - 1123.60] cleansing but they're growing pathogens
[1121.32 - 1126.36] they may not feel the growth of those
[1123.60 - 1131.20] pathogens during the cleanse six months
[1126.36 - 1133.96] later a year later boom Wham whack
[1131.20 - 1136.36] they're sick a new development a new
[1133.96 - 1139.28] problem because the pathogens got
[1136.36 - 1141.24] ignited they strengthened and overt time
[1139.28 - 1143.88] they grew and that's what happens with
[1141.24 - 1147.08] the dairy cleanses another fat-based
[1143.88 - 1150.32] cleanse is olive oil the difference is
[1147.08 - 1153.68] olive oil won't feed a pathogen so
[1150.32 - 1157.48] Epstein bar won't feed off of olive oil
[1153.68 - 1160.56] hhv6 won't feed off of olive oil strep
[1157.48 - 1163.72] won't feed off olive oil directly not at
[1160.56 - 1167.00] all but what the fat cleanses do like
[1163.72 - 1169.68] olive oil and overt fat is shuts down
[1167.00 - 1173.00] the liver it doesn't cleanse the liver
[1169.68 - 1177.12] it shuts it down throws it into
[1173.00 - 1179.48] dorcy it hurts the liver it also hurts
[1177.12 - 1181.48] the brain because you lose glucose to
[1179.48 - 1184.00] the brain instead you're getting fat to
[1181.48 - 1186.20] the brain something people don't realize
[1184.00 - 1188.52] is not the answer our brains run on
[1186.20 - 1191.48] sugar reduce the sugar going to the
[1188.52 - 1194.16] brain someone dies that's the whole
[1191.48 - 1196.20] point so we don't want more fat and just
[1194.16 - 1199.00] that in the bloodstream heading to the
[1196.20 - 1201.84] brain cleanses that are based on olive
[1199.00 - 1204.76] oil drinking a larger quantity of olive
[1201.84 - 1207.60] oil also shock the gallbladder they
[1204.76 - 1210.72] shock the gallbladder into potentially
[1207.60 - 1212.88] spitting out a big gall stone now that
[1210.72 - 1214.96] sounds like a great idea oh clean my
[1212.88 - 1218.88] gallbladder maybe I can get a gall stone
[1214.96 - 1221.80] out but people usually get a gall stone
[1218.88 - 1223.96] stuck in the duct and now they're in the
[1221.80 - 1227.36] hospital getting emergency gallbladder
[1223.96 - 1228.68] surgery over drinking a few tablespoons
[1227.36 - 1230.96] of olive oil every single morning
[1228.68 - 1232.84] morning on its own now this doesn't mean
[1230.96 - 1235.64] the gallbladder is cleansing not
[1232.84 - 1237.68] necessarily at all instead the liver and
[1235.64 - 1240.48] the gallbladder go into spasm because of
[1237.68 - 1243.80] a crisis what happens when you send that
[1240.48 - 1245.88] much overt fat and oil down the chot we
[1243.80 - 1248.88] go into crisis that crisis doesn't
[1245.88 - 1251.60] release toxins instead that crisis
[1248.88 - 1254.20] causes a spasm your liver goes into
[1251.60 - 1257.16] spasm your gallbladder goes into spasm
[1254.20 - 1259.32] because it's shutting down it does that
[1257.16 - 1262.08] because it's going into shock
[1259.32 - 1264.40] that shock might Propel one gall stone
[1262.08 - 1266.16] into a duct but it doesn't mean
[1264.40 - 1269.12] anything's cleansing or moving you
[1266.16 - 1271.72] forward many fat-based cleanses atrophy
[1269.12 - 1274.40] the brain as well like a bone broth
[1271.72 - 1276.28] cleanse just drinking bone broth every
[1274.40 - 1277.76] now and then you see somebody out there
[1276.28 - 1280.80] they're saying I did a bone broth
[1277.76 - 1283.24] cleanse I lost this much on my waistline
[1280.80 - 1286.32] and I feel better and I have more energy
[1283.24 - 1288.64] but that energy eventually Fades and
[1286.32 - 1291.28] over time they feel tired and have
[1288.64 - 1293.80] fatigue years later and even months
[1291.28 - 1296.84] later don't know why what happened was
[1293.80 - 1299.88] their adrenals got tanked it was a no
[1296.84 - 1303.20] glucose diet a no glucose diet foods
[1299.88 - 1305.80] that are lacking sugars healthy sugars
[1303.20 - 1308.88] did not allow the adrenals to get a rest
[1305.80 - 1311.32] to get a break so adrenaline was used
[1308.88 - 1313.40] during the entire cleanse so someone was
[1311.32 - 1316.76] doing the bone broth cleanse they were
[1313.40 - 1319.80] on bone broth as a fuel and then
[1316.76 - 1322.72] adrenaline as a fuel adrenaline had to
[1319.80 - 1325.40] Surge through the body constantly day
[1322.72 - 1328.24] after day week after week it eventually
[1325.40 - 1331.24] tanked the adrenals bone broth is not
[1328.24 - 1334.00] only dehydrating and not hydrating at
[1331.24 - 1336.44] all for cells but it's also filled with
[1334.00 - 1339.76] adrenaline as well because when that cow
[1336.44 - 1341.24] was being killed the adrenals exploded
[1339.76 - 1343.96] they filled the bloodstream with
[1341.24 - 1346.28] adrenaline to try to save the cow's life
[1343.96 - 1348.68] during its death so your bloodstream
[1346.28 - 1351.24] fills up with adrenaline hurting your
[1348.68 - 1354.24] own adrenals also stimulating your own
[1351.24 - 1357.32] adrenals to release even more adrenaline
[1354.24 - 1359.80] basically you're doing a bone broth diet
[1357.32 - 1362.36] a bone broth cleanse and you're killing
[1359.80 - 1364.64] and destroying your adrenal glands many
[1362.36 - 1366.40] women who do the bone broth and only the
[1364.64 - 1369.28] bone broth and they do a cleanse out of
[1366.40 - 1370.96] it pay the price dearly years later and
[1369.28 - 1373.88] now are struggling with other problems
[1370.96 - 1375.60] like chronic fatigue and adrenal fatigue
[1373.88 - 1377.36] and skin problems where their skin
[1375.60 - 1380.68] starts to wrinkle quicker and they get
[1377.36 - 1383.72] the crept skin much earlier in life
[1380.68 - 1385.60] years earlier decades earlier these are
[1383.72 - 1388.24] just a few of the cleanses that don't
[1385.60 - 1389.96] farewell for the body it isn't even just
[1388.24 - 1392.12] some of the diets out there and diet
[1389.96 - 1394.28] belief systems that don't farewell
[1392.12 - 1398.40] either for the body cause a lot of
[1394.28 - 1401.20] problems a cleanse needs to gently feed
[1398.40 - 1404.80] the liver gently cleanse the liver while
[1401.20 - 1407.56] letting it function you can't shut down
[1404.80 - 1409.48] organs while trying to cleanse and
[1407.56 - 1411.72] that's what often happens happens you
[1409.48 - 1414.48] want organs like the liver to stay
[1411.72 - 1417.00] functioning at its best you want it to
[1414.48 - 1419.48] improve instead of weaken during a
[1417.00 - 1422.80] cleanse you want the liver to come back
[1419.48 - 1427.28] to life to get reignited to start to
[1422.80 - 1429.92] awaken not go to sleep shock cleanses
[1427.28 - 1433.96] cause the livers in people to actually
[1429.92 - 1437.08] go dormant to go into shock to start to
[1433.96 - 1439.92] dumb down you want the liver to start to
[1437.08 - 1442.88] ignite to start to to awaken to be
[1439.92 - 1445.64] fueled to know it's safe to cleanse and
[1442.88 - 1448.76] that's what 369 does you also want the
[1445.64 - 1450.84] liver to cleanse In Waves you want it to
[1448.76 - 1453.72] cleanse a little bit and a little bit at
[1450.84 - 1456.48] a time and let it go deeper and deeper
[1453.72 - 1459.44] and deeper into the liver until the
[1456.48 - 1462.20] liver is fully cleansed and even then
[1459.44 - 1466.08] there needs to be repair cell repair the
[1462.20 - 1468.72] 369 cleanse creates cell repair it
[1466.08 - 1471.72] offers the liver cells an ability to
[1468.72 - 1474.76] regenerate so the liver cells can
[1471.72 - 1477.68] replace themselves faster new tissue
[1474.76 - 1479.60] grow healthy tissue so it's not just
[1477.68 - 1481.84] getting rid of toxins it's about
[1479.60 - 1485.36] allowing the liver to get what it needs
[1481.84 - 1487.92] to restore and rebirth you need a liver
[1485.36 - 1490.04] rebirthing with other cleanses out there
[1487.92 - 1492.08] when the liver does release something it
[1490.04 - 1494.96] ends up back into the liver and you
[1492.08 - 1497.08] don't want that you don't want the liver
[1494.96 - 1499.40] getting recycled poisons that it
[1497.08 - 1502.16] released and now it's bringing them back
[1499.40 - 1504.40] into the liver you don't want a spill a
[1502.16 - 1506.56] spill over and that's what happens when
[1504.40 - 1509.52] people are doing biohacks they're trying
[1506.56 - 1511.84] to shake things up all that creates is a
[1509.52 - 1513.80] spillover it doesn't create an actual
[1511.84 - 1516.12] cleanse because they're eating other
[1513.80 - 1519.24] things and doing other things in those
[1516.12 - 1521.24] biohacks or with those biohacks included
[1519.24 - 1524.48] that stop the body from releasing any
[1521.24 - 1527.16] toxins it's just a mixed bag of nuts
[1524.48 - 1529.08] it's a guessing game so now the person
[1527.16 - 1532.24] is shaking up some stuff inside their
[1529.08 - 1534.36] body and it's got nowhere to go it goes
[1532.24 - 1536.52] back into the liver and the Brain
[1534.36 - 1539.12] there's no way to cleanse it out so if
[1536.52 - 1542.04] they do something to shock the liver or
[1539.12 - 1544.28] shock their system all those toxins just
[1542.04 - 1546.32] get trapped floating around the body and
[1544.28 - 1549.20] they think they're now having some kind
[1546.32 - 1552.40] of die off or some kind of cleanse or
[1549.20 - 1554.36] toxin reaction or detox reaction when in
[1552.40 - 1557.00] reality it's just stuff being shook
[1554.36 - 1559.04] around by some biohacks and going right
[1557.00 - 1561.24] back into the liver and other organs
[1559.04 - 1563.52] including the brain If you hear about
[1561.24 - 1567.08] cleanses out there that are detoxing the
[1563.52 - 1569.92] kidneys just know this that's utterly
[1567.08 - 1572.28] ridiculous you can't detox the kidneys
[1569.92 - 1574.84] unless the body's detoxed you can't
[1572.28 - 1577.96] detox the kidneys unless your liver is
[1574.84 - 1580.40] Thoroughly detoxed properly you can't
[1577.96 - 1583.08] detox the kidneys unless your spleen
[1580.40 - 1585.92] your pancreas your brain is detoxed
[1583.08 - 1588.76] cleansed properly your kidneys can't
[1585.92 - 1591.04] start cleansing first it's not possible
[1588.76 - 1593.40] wherever your kidneys are whatever stage
[1591.04 - 1595.72] they're in they stay in that stage while
[1593.40 - 1598.08] you're cleansing now you can strengthen
[1595.72 - 1600.60] kidneys you can make them stronger you
[1598.08 - 1603.36] can make them healthier you can fortify
[1600.60 - 1605.56] them you can feed them nutrients while
[1603.36 - 1608.96] you're cleansing and that's what the 369
[1605.56 - 1611.36] does it strengthens kidneys you can do
[1608.96 - 1613.68] things to help support kidneys and
[1611.36 - 1616.88] support where they're at but you can't
[1613.68 - 1619.88] per se cleanse the kidney itself the
[1616.88 - 1622.40] tissue itself unless everything else is
[1619.88 - 1625.08] cleansed but you can strengthen kidney
[1622.40 - 1627.48] tissue you can make it stronger you can
[1625.08 - 1631.00] make it healthier you can make it more
[1627.48 - 1633.48] vital while you're cleansing the 369 is
[1631.00 - 1635.40] not a cleanse where you stop eating
[1633.48 - 1638.08] where you're not eating anymore or
[1635.40 - 1640.76] getting any calories those kinds of
[1638.08 - 1645.36] cleanses aren't good they hurt the
[1640.76 - 1647.72] adrenals the 369 is designed it's geared
[1645.36 - 1649.60] to protecting the adrenals and all
[1647.72 - 1651.96] medical ium cleanses are geared to
[1649.60 - 1653.84] protecting the adrenals other cleanses
[1651.96 - 1656.16] out there are not geared to protect the
[1653.84 - 1658.20] adrenals because first of all they don't
[1656.16 - 1660.72] know how the adrenals really truly work
[1658.20 - 1663.20] when it comes down to eating and foods
[1660.72 - 1665.40] and health if you do intermittent
[1663.20 - 1667.76] fasting you're hurting your adrenals
[1665.40 - 1669.48] even if you're getting benefits even if
[1667.76 - 1671.52] you're starting to get improvements
[1669.48 - 1674.40] you're losing weight you're feeling more
[1671.52 - 1676.48] energy what happens is yes you're
[1674.40 - 1678.72] actually giving your liver a Break by
[1676.48 - 1682.04] not eating all these fats in the morning
[1678.72 - 1684.64] by not having sausages and bacon and ham
[1682.04 - 1687.00] and hash browns with oil in it and eggs
[1684.64 - 1689.12] and butter in the morning instead you're
[1687.00 - 1691.64] not eating at all you're intermittent
[1689.12 - 1694.52] fasting you're just living off of coffee
[1691.64 - 1696.80] coffee drinks caffeine you're waiting to
[1694.52 - 1698.56] eat at the end of the day but Meanwhile
[1696.80 - 1701.56] your adrenals suffered and you don't
[1698.56 - 1704.64] know it they suffered all day long there
[1701.56 - 1707.20] wasn't a balance of nutrients glucose
[1704.64 - 1709.20] trace minerals they weren't there
[1707.20 - 1711.60] instead it was coffee coffee it was
[1709.20 - 1713.60] going without you might have drank water
[1711.60 - 1715.60] or you might be consuming something else
[1713.60 - 1717.56] but you're starving yourself all morning
[1715.60 - 1720.44] and all afternoon your intermittent
[1717.56 - 1722.80] fasting this damages the adrenals over
[1720.44 - 1724.56] time and cleanses like intermittent
[1722.80 - 1727.44] fasting which a lot of people consider
[1724.56 - 1729.52] are a type of cleanse do not protect the
[1727.44 - 1731.88] adrenals there's never been a more
[1729.52 - 1734.36] important time to cleanse on this planet
[1731.88 - 1737.20] this planet has grown toxic and it's
[1734.36 - 1738.68] getting more toxic and are we truly
[1737.20 - 1742.84] adapting

[1751.92 - 1756.36] we're getting more toxic and it's only
[1753.80 - 1758.24] getting worse and I get it there's a lot
[1756.36 - 1759.60] of ads out there there's a lot of bioh
[1758.24 - 1761.76] hacks out there there's a lot of
[1759.60 - 1764.84] programs everybody thinks they have the
[1761.76 - 1766.72] answer influencers are experimenting
[1764.84 - 1768.36] they're experimenting on themselves
[1766.72 - 1770.88] they're taking a crowd of people with
[1768.36 - 1772.48] them they're experimenting 3 months
[1770.88 - 1774.48] later they change they're doing
[1772.48 - 1775.88] something different and then they grab a
[1774.48 - 1779.40] couple of things that originate from
[1775.88 - 1782.32] medical medium like metals and fluoride
[1779.40 - 1784.48] and Plastics and microplastics and at
[1782.32 - 1786.44] the same time they're screaming that
[1784.48 - 1789.20] they're also screaming about processed
[1786.44 - 1791.52] foods and food chemicals but what it all
[1789.20 - 1793.32] boils down to it they don't know why
[1791.52 - 1795.20] they're sick they don't know what's
[1793.32 - 1797.80] really causing their sicknesses they
[1795.20 - 1799.80] can't see it and maybe not even believe
[1797.80 - 1801.92] it and then they're looking at what's on
[1799.80 - 1803.88] their plate and that's what it boils
[1801.92 - 1805.44] down to they're staring at their plate
[1803.88 - 1807.52] and they're thinking okay I got to
[1805.44 - 1810.32] change my game I got to start doing

[1815.64 - 1819.36] they look at their plate and they get
[1817.32 - 1821.36] confused and then they switch gears
[1819.36 - 1823.44] again and then they add some Pearl
[1821.36 - 1825.76] powder to it and some collagen they try
[1823.44 - 1828.00] to Market it up and some colostrum they
[1825.76 - 1829.40] try to sell something at the same time
