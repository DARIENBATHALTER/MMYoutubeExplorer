==================================================

In this episode of the Medical Medium podcast, Anthony William discusses the ongoing 'food wars' between plant-based and animal-based diets, highlighting that both sides are often misled and brainwashed into believing their diets are the ultimate solution for health. He emphasizes that many individuals who switch diets often revert back due to health issues, which they incorrectly attribute to a lack of certain nutrients. Ultimately, he argues that true healing comes from understanding the underlying causes of illness rather than adhering rigidly to dietary beliefs.
