[1.28 - 7.68] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.28 - 10.20] with their health chances are whether
[7.68 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.20 - 17.52] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.48 - 21.36] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.52 - 25.84] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.36 - 28.44] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.84 - 31.20] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.48] condition you're far from from
[31.20 - 38.60] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.48 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.60 - 45.28] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 48.36] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[45.28 - 50.48] Williams we're talking about food Wars
[48.36 - 53.32] both sides of the food Wars are
[50.48 - 56.48] brainwashed meanwhile they're all still
[53.32 - 58.80] getting sick no matter what food belief
[56.48 - 61.40] system someone belongs to whether
[58.80 - 63.88] plant-based or animal-based or even
[61.40 - 66.40] everything in moderation they use
[63.88 - 69.36] science to attack anyone who doesn't
[66.40 - 72.68] share their belief system everybody's
[69.36 - 75.52] fighting both sides are at War and their
[72.68 - 77.92] eye isn't on the ball about what creates
[75.52 - 77.92] chronic
[78.40 - 85.64] illness as soon as vegans or people
[81.56 - 88.96] eating plant-based get sick they tend to
[85.64 - 92.28] run back to animal Foods when people on
[88.96 - 95.60] already animal base diets get sick most
[92.28 - 97.08] of them tend to stay with animal foods
[95.60 - 99.12] and keep searching searching and
[97.08 - 101.92] searching for other reasons they could
[99.12 - 104.00] be sick or suffering there are not a lot
[101.92 - 106.24] of vegan families and plant-based
[104.00 - 109.68] families where the children are born and
[106.24 - 112.12] bred vegan and stay that way nearly
[109.68 - 115.00] everybody is raised on animal protein
[112.12 - 118.04] diets nearly everybody on this planet is
[115.00 - 120.84] raised on animal protein in some shape
[118.04 - 123.76] fashion or form and now that's why most
[120.84 - 125.44] people who go plant-based or vegan and
[123.76 - 127.88] they get sick they end up running back
[125.44 - 130.80] to animal protein they go back to their
[127.88 - 133.04] roots to where they came from they get
[130.80 - 136.16] scared they get scared into it by
[133.04 - 139.12] practitioners doctors and family members
[136.16 - 141.20] they get scared into it by themselves
[139.12 - 142.72] they start thinking I'm lacking
[141.20 - 145.16] something they start thinking they're
[142.72 - 148.20] missing something something they get
[145.16 - 149.88] from animal protein something they get
[148.20 - 151.96] from some kind of animal product and it
[149.88 - 154.00] must be the answer to why they're sick
[151.96 - 156.72] even though they came from animal
[154.00 - 159.32] products that was their diet originally
[156.72 - 160.92] they were born and raised on it and
[159.32 - 162.44] after they went vegan for a little while
[160.92 - 164.12] they're still sick or they're getting
[162.44 - 165.96] sick they run back and they're like I
[164.12 - 168.56] must be missing something maybe I should
[165.96 - 171.12] start eating liver now and then they see
[168.56 - 173.12] something on social they see a video
[171.12 - 175.12] they see some material they read out
[173.12 - 177.32] there and it says they should be on beef
[175.12 - 179.08] Hearts that's where the nutrients are so
[177.32 - 181.16] they get really confused and now they're
[179.08 - 183.68] searching for the best beef Hearts they
[181.16 - 186.84] can find one of the interesting things
[183.68 - 189.76] is both sides the animal-based and
[186.84 - 192.44] plant-based believe that protein is the
[189.76 - 194.40] answer for everything so when anything
[192.44 - 197.08] goes wrong or any kind of Health
[194.40 - 199.60] struggle at all happens or any kind of
[197.08 - 201.88] deficiency they see in their blood work
[199.60 - 204.48] when they're at the doctor's office they
[201.88 - 206.28] instantly think protein and their
[204.48 - 208.76] practitioners and doctors Healthcare
[206.28 - 211.48] Providers say protein too so they think
[208.76 - 213.16] protein is the an answer for everything
[211.48 - 216.40] this partly comes from people being
[213.16 - 219.76] raised on animal protein just the word
[216.40 - 222.08] itself protein vegans and plant-based
[219.76 - 224.40] people won't adopt this way of eating
[222.08 - 226.88] unless someone convinces them in a
[224.40 - 229.44] confident manner that there's protein to
[226.88 - 232.72] be had that there's protein in a
[229.44 - 235.12] plant-based diet which there is but both
[232.72 - 237.92] animal-based and plant-based folks are
[235.12 - 241.68] brainwashed to think it's all about
[237.92 - 244.76] protein because protein protein sounds
[241.68 - 247.20] scientific both sides have to feel like
[244.76 - 249.68] their diet belief system no matter what
[247.20 - 252.68] kind of name it has no matter how fancy
[249.68 - 255.64] it is that it's science-based and you
[252.68 - 259.12] can get enough protein both sides are
[255.64 - 263.16] also conditioned and brainwashed for
[259.12 - 263.16] confrontation they get into a
[263.92 - 270.32] fight I got my money on Old
[267.04 - 274.04] Nessie who you got your money on Albert
[270.32 - 277.20] I got Alber is going to win I got my
[274.04 - 279.68] whoa no get get back in the pen no
[277.20 - 279.68] there's still
[279.88 - 284.76] fighting before plant-based people
[282.36 - 287.72] revert back to eating animal protein
[284.76 - 290.40] diets they got to fight in them first
[287.72 - 292.48] they fight back plant-based folks don't
[290.40 - 295.76] just look at animal-based folks and say
[292.48 - 298.20] hey look we're all sick instead each of
[295.76 - 300.52] them get their weapons out they find
[298.20 - 303.76] their weapons of choice in the form of
[300.52 - 306.00] studies research papers both the
[303.76 - 308.48] committed animal protein people and the
[306.00 - 311.20] committed plant-based and vegan people
[308.48 - 313.76] call themselves researchers now they're
[311.20 - 315.76] all researchers they spend a lot of time
[313.76 - 317.92] on the internet looking around for
[315.76 - 320.68] information they throw articles at each
[317.92 - 323.92] other's faces articles that they feel
[320.68 - 326.40] are based on science they say this keto
[323.92 - 330.92] study says when it isn't even a real
[326.40 - 334.08] study it's just a survey or a uniformed
[330.92 - 336.44] observation or Theory theoretical paper
[334.08 - 338.72] put together by somebody or anybody in
[336.44 - 341.64] health with limited experience on the
[338.72 - 344.80] issues or the subject and if they do
[341.64 - 348.08] reference an actual clinical study how
[344.80 - 350.60] reputable was it who funded it was it
[348.08 - 352.80] based on a handful of paid participants
[350.60 - 355.44] from the same age and background
[352.80 - 357.84] monitored over a very short time span
[355.44 - 359.84] leading to gross generalizations and
[357.84 - 364.68] misinformation where was the study study
[359.84 - 366.96] done was it even done the reality the
[364.68 - 369.20] bottom line is that both sides are
[366.96 - 370.92] brainwashed they're brainwashed that
[369.20 - 374.96] they can trust the science behind their
[370.92 - 377.24] diet they're brainwashed that protein is
[374.96 - 380.12] everything they're brainwashed to
[377.24 - 382.08] confront each other and fight each other
[380.12 - 384.64] both sides of the food Wars are
[382.08 - 387.64] brainwashed that intermittent fasting is
[384.64 - 390.16] healthy both sides are brainwashed that
[387.64 - 393.08] caffeine is good that adding quality
[390.16 - 395.84] salt to food is good that apple cider
[393.08 - 399.04] vinegar is good does that ring a bell to
[395.84 - 401.32] anyone both sides are brainwashed that
[399.04 - 403.76] you can fix all your problems through
[401.32 - 406.36] breathing techniques or through
[403.76 - 408.48] manifesting both sides are brainwashed
[406.36 - 411.64] that chocolate is plant medicine that
[408.48 - 413.44] it's good for you both are brainwashed
[411.64 - 416.28] that they don't create any waste with
[413.44 - 419.00] their food decisions and diets this is a
[416.28 - 420.96] good one right here both are brainwashed
[419.00 - 423.64] that they're diet belief systems are
[420.96 - 425.88] sustainable and are all about
[423.64 - 428.52] sustainability both sides are
[425.88 - 430.64] conditioned to run to the conventional
[428.52 - 433.56] doctor for antibiotics the moment they
[430.64 - 435.72] get sick both sides are brainwashed to
[433.56 - 438.16] believe that autoimmune symptoms a
[435.72 - 440.24] result of the body attacking itself
[438.16 - 442.44] here's another good one both sides are
[440.24 - 446.16] brainwashed to believe that their genes
[442.44 - 448.36] dictate why they're sick here's another
[446.16 - 451.92] both sides are brainwashed to be afraid
[448.36 - 454.44] of fruit so much so that even if they do
[451.92 - 456.68] start believing fruit is okay to eat a
[454.44 - 459.92] little more fruit each day all it could
[456.68 - 461.64] take is one whistle from a food Brigade
[459.92 - 464.28] that sends them right back into Fruit
[461.64 - 468.80] fear once again here's one of my
[464.28 - 471.48] favorites both sides have B12 iron and
[468.80 - 474.56] calcium deficiencies while both sides
[471.48 - 476.88] are brainwashed to believe that only
[474.56 - 479.00] plant-based and vegan people are at risk
[476.88 - 481.88] of these deficiencies not the animal-
[479.00 - 485.40] based people both sides are worried
[481.88 - 488.68] about vitamin D deficiency both sides
[485.40 - 492.00] are vitamin D deficient and both sides
[488.68 - 495.88] believe vitamin D Mega doses are the
[492.00 - 499.20] answer both sides believe in fermented
[495.88 - 502.48] foods both sides believe that all your
[499.20 - 505.00] problems stem from your gut and both
[502.48 - 507.88] sides believe that the brain is made of
[505.00 - 510.80] fat and you need fat in your brain to
[507.88 - 513.28] survive this is a great one right here
[510.80 - 516.56] both sides believe their blood tests are
[513.28 - 520.16] all accurate here's one for the record
[516.56 - 522.40] books both sides unknowingly get too
[520.16 - 525.48] much blood drawn when they get a blood
[522.40 - 528.72] test both sides believe that a diet of
[525.48 - 531.52] processed foods mad eating habits and
[528.72 - 533.84] fried and greasy Foods was the sole
[531.52 - 536.16] cause of any symptoms before they Chang
[533.84 - 539.68] their diet when really there's much more
[536.16 - 542.44] to it this is an interesting one both
[539.68 - 543.96] sides believe their food choices now
[542.44 - 547.52] make them spiritually
[543.96 - 549.96] enlightened and my favorite both sides
[547.52 - 552.80] believe they're very much different from
[549.96 - 556.44] the other side that they're opposites
[552.80 - 560.08] when they're not the funny thing is they
[556.44 - 562.00] are the same side the same belief system
[560.08 - 564.56] they shop at the same markets to get
[562.00 - 568.72] their food and the only difference is
[564.56 - 570.92] that one eats meat and one doesn't still
[568.72 - 574.24] the battle each other they fight each
[570.92 - 578.08] other they face off against each other
[574.24 - 581.68] and both sides use flawed science fake
[578.08 - 583.72] science underdeveloped science and
[581.68 - 586.60] broken science to back up their
[583.72 - 589.60] positions Animal product science doesn't
[586.60 - 592.36] believe in plant-based science
[589.60 - 594.84] plant-based science doesn't believe in
[592.36 - 598.04] Animal product science these science
[594.84 - 600.20] entities are against each other and the
[598.04 - 602.96] conventional mainstream Medical Science
[600.20 - 605.28] entity does not support any of the
[602.96 - 608.12] sciences that either plant-based or
[605.28 - 610.00] animal-based Believers are projecting I
[608.12 - 612.44] could just hear it now I know people are
[610.00 - 614.56] going to be like no that's not true I
[612.44 - 616.40] believe in science and my science is
[614.56 - 619.20] good and big science believes in my
[616.40 - 620.92] little science and my science is more
[619.20 - 622.08] important than the plant-based science
[620.92 - 623.60] and plant-based people are going to be
[622.08 - 625.48] like no my science is more important
[623.60 - 627.52] than your science that's a science to
[625.48 - 629.16] believe in you don't need to eat meat
[627.52 - 631.08] and then the meat eater is like you need
[629.16 - 634.48] eat meat and but yet they're all the
[631.08 - 638.88] same on top of everything food War
[634.48 - 641.24] Battlers go for the emotional side vegan
[638.88 - 643.20] and plant-based Believers tell Animal
[641.24 - 646.60] product Believers that they're killing
[643.20 - 649.24] animals destroying rainforests clueless
[646.60 - 650.96] that animals have souls and making their
[649.24 - 654.04] children eat dead
[650.96 - 656.28] animals Animal product Believers tell
[654.04 - 658.52] vegan and plant-based Believers they're
[656.28 - 662.00] causing malnutrition in their babies and
[658.52 - 665.04] children starving them of protein not
[662.00 - 666.88] preparing them for quote real life and
[665.04 - 669.76] keeping them away from
[666.88 - 671.88] moderation no matter what food belief
[669.76 - 674.00] system someone belongs to whether
[671.88 - 676.48] plant-based or animal- based or even
[674.00 - 679.24] everything in moderation they use
[676.48 - 681.64] science to attack anyone who doesn't
[679.24 - 683.80] share their belief system that any group
[681.64 - 685.92] can find Science and data to back up
[683.80 - 689.04] their position that science hands out
[685.92 - 693.12] the weapons to both sides of the battle
[689.04 - 695.64] should make us question that very War
[693.12 - 698.72] meanwhile this whole time everybody's
[695.64 - 701.72] fighting both sides are at War and their
[698.72 - 702.88] eye isn't on the ball about what creates
[701.72 - 706.24] chronic
[702.88 - 709.40] illness when a person or a person's
[706.24 - 710.28] child gets sideswiped or blindsided by
[709.40 - 712.48] health
[710.28 - 715.20] challenges and medical science and
[712.48 - 717.60] research doesn't have an answer and
[715.20 - 719.64] can't understand why they're sick
[717.60 - 722.76] whatever belief system they've consume
[719.64 - 725.28] themselves with starts to break apart
[722.76 - 728.36] whatever diet whatever diet belief
[725.28 - 730.96] system whatever Trend whatever they
[728.36 - 734.04] believed in that science backed or
[730.96 - 735.16] alternative science backed it all just
[734.04 - 738.44] Falls to
[735.16 - 741.80] Pieces it doesn't matter what study what
[738.44 - 744.60] research paper what trend they first
[741.80 - 747.76] believed in it doesn't matter what study
[744.60 - 750.36] that convinced them to go a certain way
[747.76 - 752.56] it doesn't matter what podcast doctor
[750.36 - 753.96] doesn't matter what book they read that
[752.56 - 756.92] seemed like it was backed up and
[753.96 - 759.24] supported by science it all just starts
[756.92 - 762.32] to fade away because when they get
[759.24 - 765.68] chronically sick and there's no answers
[762.32 - 767.88] it all falls apart when someone gets hit
[765.68 - 770.76] with neurological Lyme multiple
[767.88 - 772.24] sclerosis chronic fatigue syndrome or
[770.76 - 776.00] they're dealing with some form of
[772.24 - 778.40] anxiety that's crippling them depression
[776.00 - 780.40] they got the worst brain fog they can't
[778.40 - 783.08] function they can't be productive
[780.40 - 785.72] they're struggling or they got bad bad
[783.08 - 787.96] bad digestive problems they're
[785.72 - 791.20] constipated they're bloated they're in
[787.96 - 793.04] pain or they have vertigo and dizziness
[791.20 - 794.96] where they feel like they're on a boat
[793.04 - 796.64] and they're rocking back and forth or
[794.96 - 799.84] they're just vomiting because they have
[796.64 - 802.00] vertigo or they got tingles and numbness
[799.84 - 805.56] bad migraines where they can't live
[802.00 - 807.76] their life because the migraines ADHD or
[805.56 - 811.56] OCD crippling
[807.76 - 815.04] OCD autoimmune or eating disorders when
[811.56 - 817.96] those things start to disrupt their life
[815.04 - 820.20] any doubts someone has had in the back
[817.96 - 823.48] of their mind about a plant-based diet
[820.20 - 827.52] or veganism starts to grow like
[823.48 - 829.60] weeds the doubts usually take over fast
[827.52 - 830.80] and once again that person goes into the
[829.60 - 834.32] Land of the
[830.80 - 836.00] Lost they go searching all over again
[834.32 - 837.52] just like they were when they first
[836.00 - 839.24] started searching at the beginning
[837.52 - 841.88] looking for a direction and making a
[839.24 - 845.52] decision to go vegan and plant-based
[841.88 - 847.80] from the beginning some still hold on
[845.52 - 850.12] they hold on to plant-base and veganism
[847.80 - 852.48] beliefs and they fight for a little
[850.12 - 854.72] while in that lost land while they're
[852.48 - 856.80] sick they'll see their functional
[854.72 - 859.16] medicine doctor or their plant-based
[856.80 - 862.16] naturopath and they'll fight for it
[859.16 - 865.08] until a family member or friend ignites
[862.16 - 868.36] that tiny doubt that was in their head
[865.08 - 869.36] and the doubt grows and grows into a
[868.36 - 873.04] mean
[869.36 - 877.56] nasty monster they defect they change
[873.04 - 880.16] your diet belief system and poof unless
[877.56 - 882.36] someone finds medical medium
[880.16 - 884.48] information they don't know why they're
[882.36 - 886.76] sick so they believe it's caused by
[884.48 - 888.80] their diet it's not just a rookie thing
[886.76 - 891.56] in health to believe that diet is why
[888.80 - 894.68] you're sick it's an entrenched
[891.56 - 897.88] conditioning an entrenched belief system
[894.68 - 899.84] among long-term diet Believers too
[897.88 - 902.80] people who commit MIT to their diet
[899.84 - 906.20] belief systems believe that their diets
[902.80 - 908.64] beforehand were the sole reason for any
[906.20 - 912.36] symptoms they experienced instead of
[908.64 - 915.00] understanding pathogens heavy metals and
[912.36 - 917.72] chemical exposure as the source of their
[915.00 - 919.08] symptoms foundational landmarks of
[917.72 - 921.32] medical medium
[919.08 - 923.48] information part of the brainwashing
[921.32 - 926.84] mechanism that's out there is when
[923.48 - 930.52] symptoms arise and come up as they're
[926.84 - 932.76] already following a a belief system if
[930.52 - 935.88] it's plant-based they'll fall through
[932.76 - 938.32] the trapo of believing they got sick
[935.88 - 940.76] from the lack of animal products if they
[938.32 - 943.64] get sick on an animal-based diet on the
[940.76 - 946.12] other hand they won't blame their diet
[943.64 - 948.72] totally they'll be more apt to blame
[946.12 - 950.56] factors like stress or unhappiness
[948.72 - 953.32] they'll be more afraid of fruit than
[950.56 - 955.76] ever before they'll feel like maybe
[953.32 - 959.24] there's a spiritual or genetic reason
[955.76 - 962.08] why they're sick each side plant based
[959.24 - 964.68] and animal-based has its underbelly
[962.08 - 967.48] exposed plant-based Believers are more
[964.68 - 969.64] susceptible to getting slammed about
[967.48 - 972.12] deficiencies because they've long been
[969.64 - 974.44] fed doubt about whether a plant-based
[972.12 - 978.56] diet offers them all the nutrition they
[974.44 - 980.92] need both sides are susceptible to fear
[978.56 - 982.44] both sides get sick with the same types
[980.92 - 986.28] of symptoms and
[982.44 - 988.56] conditions once they become sick both
[986.28 - 990.24] plant-based and animal-based believers
[988.56 - 992.88] start worrying about the
[990.24 - 996.04] microbiome bacterial overgrowth in the

[1008.04 - 1014.56] enough they're clones of themselves it's
[1011.72 - 1016.56] a constant revolving door of trying to
[1014.56 - 1019.80] get improvements from mixing and
[1016.56 - 1022.24] matching flip-flopping guessing games
[1019.80 - 1024.52] try this try that eat this differently
[1022.24 - 1026.48] eat that differently but yet eat this a
[1024.52 - 1028.68] little differently than that it's a game
[1026.48 - 1030.96] that occupies you while your body is
[1028.68 - 1033.00] fighting for temporary results and
[1030.96 - 1035.32] fighting for its life temporary
[1033.00 - 1037.72] improvements and temporary relief come
[1035.32 - 1040.16] for some people but it's back into the
[1037.72 - 1043.80] game again the guessing games they don't
[1040.16 - 1047.80] stop some practices can be supportive
[1043.80 - 1049.88] some not you can't be sure which or
[1047.80 - 1052.12] which because you can't read the signs
[1049.88 - 1054.40] and symptoms that your body's providing
[1052.12 - 1057.40] you because whether you believe in
[1054.40 - 1061.48] plant-based or animal-based you don't
[1057.40 - 1063.96] know why you're really sick the game
[1061.48 - 1066.80] could go on for so long and go on and on
[1063.96 - 1071.40] and on it could go on forever in a
[1066.80 - 1073.80] person's life 10 20 50 years until they
[1071.40 - 1079.12] can finally find a way
[1073.80 - 1082.96] out healing from a symptom condition or
[1079.12 - 1085.76] disease isn't about choosing sides it
[1082.96 - 1088.72] isn't just about going plant-based or
[1085.76 - 1092.36] animal based or everything in
[1088.72 - 1096.36] moderation recovery isn't going to be
[1092.36 - 1097.64] Reliant upon a scientific study we may
[1096.36 - 1102.00] have that
[1097.64 - 1104.40] illusion in the end healing is about
[1102.00 - 1108.12] understanding that we've been tricked
[1104.40 - 1111.60] all along the way duped the wool has
[1108.12 - 1115.28] been pulled over our eyes we've been
[1111.60 - 1118.48] bamboozled healing is about learning
[1115.28 - 1122.52] that all sides are continually
[1118.48 - 1127.36] fold once you learn why you truly became
