[67.28 - 72.20] causes eczema so um do you have 30 years
[69.88 - 74.24] to wait for that to get those answers to

[110.96 - 115.80] see we might be able to pull it off the
[113.12 - 118.64] real causes of this chronic skin
[115.80 - 120.88] condition and it's all still largely
[118.64 - 122.96] unknown in medical community ities in
[120.88 - 125.84] fact what's really funny you look into
[122.96 - 127.56] it and you'll see it is unknown so so
[125.84 - 131.64] many millions of people are suffering
[127.56 - 134.20] with no clear answers in this episode I
[131.64 - 136.88] will reveal what's really behind skin
[134.20 - 139.92] conditions like exim unisis and even
[136.88 - 143.28] acne and how you can begin to heal
[139.92 - 145.64] pretty cool um so you know remember to
[143.28 - 148.24] go to my website too I wanted to mention

[174.44 - 177.64] what's happening here and this is your
[175.96 - 180.00] first time you know with the show and
[177.64 - 182.20] everything else started at the age four
[180.00 - 183.88] heard a voice perfectly clear just like
[182.20 - 185.84] someone standing in the room it's
[183.88 - 188.08] different it's not like channeling it's
[185.84 - 190.28] not like that kind of thing this is like
[188.08 - 193.64] you hearing your friend talk in real
[190.28 - 196.16] time in your ear so that's how it works
[193.64 - 197.84] and because of that it's been this thing
[196.16 - 199.28] where I can get the information for
[197.84 - 201.72] people no matter what I'm doing doesn't
[199.28 - 203.60] matter if I'm tired exhausted doesn't
[201.72 - 206.84] matter if I'm run down doesn't matter if
[203.60 - 209.00] I you know if if I'm upset or if I'm sad
[206.84 - 211.76] about something spirit will provide the
[209.00 - 214.08] information at all times nonstop no
[211.76 - 215.96] matter who's around me what's going on
[214.08 - 217.72] and because of that that medical
[215.96 - 219.32] information that's ahead of ahead of
[217.72 - 221.32] medical research and medical Sciences
[219.32 - 224.12] time I've been able to give that
[221.32 - 226.36] information since a child to people I've
[224.12 - 228.60] dedicated my entire life doing this
[226.36 - 231.00] literally doing this and only this my
[228.60 - 232.48] entire life and so that's a little bit
[231.00 - 235.00] about me I've helped tens of thousands
[232.48 - 237.88] of people heal find the information they
[235.00 - 241.56] need like we're doing on this show so
[237.88 - 244.08] let's go let's go into the eimos
[241.56 - 245.72] psoriasis let's start talking about that
[244.08 - 249.04] right now because I know we have to get
[245.72 - 251.16] this done um so if we're going to talk
[249.04 - 252.48] about Xmen psoriasis though I have to
[251.16 - 253.88] tell you something first of all fasten
[252.48 - 255.32] your seat bels get ready for this
[253.88 - 257.88] because I'm releasing some serious
[255.32 - 259.52] information in this show this is really
[257.88 - 261.72] serious if we're going to talk about
[259.52 - 264.44] Xmen psoriasis then we have to clear the
[261.72 - 267.04] air about the great auto immune mistake
[264.44 - 269.80] once again I talked about it recently
[267.04 - 271.64] you guys know okay the reason why I have
[269.80 - 274.64] to talk about this is because aom and
[271.64 - 276.08] psoriasis are they're classified and
[274.64 - 278.72] listed as
[276.08 - 282.44] autoimmune which medical communities
[278.72 - 284.16] believe it's your body attacking itself
[282.44 - 287.76] so Medical Research Medical Science
[284.16 - 290.28] believes your body's attacking itself
[287.76 - 293.16] autoimmunity so you know look if I went
[290.28 - 295.84] to the doctor because of a rash on my
[293.16 - 297.64] arm that was chronic and I was diagnosed
[295.84 - 300.16] with eczema or
[297.64 - 301.92] psoriasis and was told my body was
[300.16 - 305.00] attacking itself I would leave the
[301.92 - 306.96] office to feed it I really would now if
[305.00 - 310.20] that was the truth if that's just really
[306.96 - 312.64] how it worked then okay fine I at least
[310.20 - 314.72] it's the truth but it's not the truth I
[312.64 - 317.24] I it's not and I can prove it in many
[314.72 - 318.96] ways including helping people heal in
[317.24 - 320.56] all the years I put into it including
[318.96 - 322.60] the information I have that's Advanced
[320.56 - 325.72] you'll see you just hang in there we're
[322.60 - 327.32] going to learn about it all um you know
[325.72 - 329.00] if I drove home from that doctor's
[327.32 - 331.28] office of course I would feel let down
[329.00 - 334.20] defeated your body does not attack
[331.28 - 336.80] itself and the fact that I have to bring
[334.20 - 340.12] this great mistake up of autoimmune
[336.80 - 342.56] multiple times with almost every illness
[340.12 - 345.96] I have to cover shows me how many of us
[342.56 - 349.32] have been let down misled been given
[345.96 - 351.12] misinformation and truly this is really
[349.32 - 353.52] that serious and how serious this really
[351.12 - 355.00] is I mean think about it and there's
[353.52 - 358.44] very little known about what causes
[355.00 - 360.88] eczema for example so think about it if
[358.44 - 365.56] you even look up what causes eczema it
[360.88 - 368.12] it's unknown so how is it even possible
[365.56 - 370.44] to blame your body and say it's
[368.12 - 372.28] attacking itself destroying your skin
[370.44 - 375.76] that your tea cells are destroying the
[372.28 - 377.96] skin when it's unknown as to anything
[375.76 - 380.36] about the disease or illness or
[377.96 - 382.68] condition whatsoever in medical research
[380.36 - 385.36] and medical science think about that one
[382.68 - 386.92] think about that is that unbelievable
[385.36 - 389.88] just kind of think about that for a
[386.92 - 391.52] couple of minutes exactly so when you
[389.88 - 394.16] know someone says to me what does the
[391.52 - 395.84] big medical medium know about you know
[394.16 - 397.88] Medical Research Medical Science I'll
[395.84 - 399.60] tell you I have the answers from spirit
[397.88 - 404.00] thank God and I've been able to help
[399.60 - 406.32] people thank God and it's that important
[404.00 - 409.72] because what's the what's the opposite
[406.32 - 412.08] what's the lad the lad is unknown
[409.72 - 414.12] meaning cause of illness and disease
[412.08 - 416.40] unknown and we're going to blame it on
[414.12 - 418.48] you that's the latter what what's the
[416.40 - 420.96] difference there you want to go that way
[418.48 - 422.48] so when someone challenges you or
[420.96 - 423.84] challenges you on what you're doing to
[422.48 - 425.08] take care of yourself and all the good
[423.84 - 426.36] stuff you're doing for yourself they
[425.08 - 427.84] challenge you what are you going to are
[426.36 - 430.04] you going to say okay so I'm supposed to
[427.84 - 432.28] do the latter it's unknown and my body's
[430.04 - 434.40] attacking him itself and that's it so
[432.28 - 437.60] that's what you're supposed to do I mean
[434.40 - 439.40] come on so we we have to we have to come
[437.60 - 441.44] we have to be just honest we have to be
[439.40 - 443.80] honest we have to be clear there has to
[441.44 - 446.36] be Clarity there has to be understanding
[443.80 - 448.88] there has to be compassion with this
[446.36 - 451.88] there has to be all of this so there's
[448.88 - 454.00] very little Unknown about what causes
[451.88 - 457.00] azema for example in the in the world of
[454.00 - 462.36] medicine it's thought that your genes
[457.00 - 465.48] once again are fouled up or all miss
[462.36 - 467.68] combobulated or bumbled okay like your
[465.48 - 469.32] jeans are all messed up so that's
[467.68 - 472.60] actually the other option they have they
[469.32 - 474.00] think it could be your jeans listen
[472.60 - 476.28] that's one of the other great mistakes
[474.00 - 477.84] that I covered recently and and before
[476.28 - 479.44] you can't think it's your jeans whatever
[477.84 - 481.88] you do you think it's your jeans you're
[479.44 - 484.00] just going to get in trouble because
[481.88 - 486.32] it'll break down your immune system it
[484.00 - 487.60] will break down your immune system and
[486.32 - 489.72] and one of these days we're going to
[487.60 - 492.40] cover the whole methylation issue the
[489.72 - 494.56] MTHFR gene mutation which is actually
[492.40 - 496.68] going by storm raging through all the
[494.56 - 498.96] alternative doctor's offices right now
[496.68 - 501.28] and even conventional and functional
[498.96 - 503.00] that is a confusion now yes there is a
[501.28 - 505.32] methylation problem that we have out
[503.00 - 506.76] there but the gene mutation test is not
[505.32 - 508.56] what it's cracked up to be I'm going to
[506.76 - 510.52] have to expose that to help everybody
[508.56 - 512.08] out so we can move move forward that's a
[510.52 - 515.08] whole another thing it's about the genes
[512.08 - 517.08] anyway so you know basically another
[515.08 - 519.52] thing that the medical communities think
[517.08 - 521.92] that causes exmos orasis is
[519.52 - 523.64] allergies some kind of allergy to
[521.92 - 526.12] something I mean come on talking about
[523.64 - 530.04] throwing darts at a barn that I mean
[526.12 - 533.68] really um same with psoriasis it causes
[530.04 - 535.12] unknown um it's either your genes or
[533.68 - 537.20] it's your white blood count your te-
[535.12 - 541.68] cells that are attacking your
[537.20 - 544.36] skin yeah nice Theory nice Theory look
[541.68 - 547.40] I'm sarcastic I am I have to admit I'm a
[544.36 - 549.32] little more sarcastic today because I'll
[547.40 - 550.88] tell you why I'll tell you why we'll
[549.32 - 553.48] talk about why I'm sarcastic it's it's
[550.88 - 556.40] coming up look this is once again Theory
[553.48 - 558.48] no real answers and the best it gets in
[556.40 - 561.48] medical research and medical science is
[558.48 - 563.80] cause unknown so let's blame you and
[561.48 - 566.36] your body that's why I'm sarcastic about
[563.80 - 569.72] it because it's being you're being
[566.36 - 571.12] blamed so let's blame your genan once
[569.72 - 573.36] again that's why I'm sarcastic because
[571.12 - 576.40] you're being blamed think about that
[573.36 - 580.04] today is the day we air out the
[576.40 - 582.40] truth about psoriasis and eczema and
[580.04 - 584.52] also we will try to cover some AC acne
[582.40 - 586.36] today cystic acne if we can so I know
[584.52 - 588.96] the you know if you're suffering from
[586.36 - 592.72] that we're going to do our best as far
[588.96 - 596.20] as eczema and psoriasis goes it's a
[592.72 - 598.32] whole different level of suffering if
[596.20 - 601.60] you are a loved one or friend is dealing
[598.32 - 603.84] with it you know different illnesses and
[601.60 - 606.72] symptoms of conditions people who have
[603.84 - 608.16] created who people who have been dealing
[606.72 - 610.88] with suffering at different times and
[608.16 - 612.72] levels in different ways exen psoriasis
[610.88 - 615.36] is a different
[612.72 - 617.28] ballpark so we all suffer from these
[615.36 - 619.64] different illnesses out there we we you
[617.28 - 623.16] know different diagnoses conditions
[619.64 - 625.76] symptoms but examen orasis creates a
[623.16 - 629.28] suffering that sometimes just can't be
[625.76 - 632.08] matched and and this is why I have a
[629.28 - 634.96] snarkiness about me and and some sarcasm
[632.08 - 637.12] about everything because I've seen the
[634.96 - 639.24] suffering I've seen it for years I've
[637.12 - 640.96] seen it for decades if you've had eczema
[639.24 - 642.96] and it's been pretty bad or flared up if
[640.96 - 646.08] you've had um psoriasis you know what
[642.96 - 649.12] I'm talking about the itchiness is
[646.08 - 651.56] unlike any other the pain on the skin
[649.12 - 653.88] unlike any other the burning the
[651.56 - 656.12] swelling in many cases bleeding is
[653.88 - 658.04] unlike any other okay that we've dealt
[656.12 - 660.68] with or deal with you know think of the
[658.04 - 663.04] worst case of poison Ivy but then
[660.68 - 666.52] imagine it being
[663.04 - 668.56] chronic you know so this is this is a
[666.52 - 670.76] piece of it this is a piece of the deal
[668.56 - 672.88] of of why I get kind of snarky of why I
[670.76 - 676.20] seem like I have an attitude at some
[672.88 - 678.68] times because you know it I've seen the
[676.20 - 680.36] suffering I know what it is I know it's
[678.68 - 683.60] what it's about and I've had to help
[680.36 - 686.44] people recover and you know when when
[683.60 - 688.48] when the answer out there is only cause
[686.44 - 690.96] unknown it's your genes or maybe an
[688.48 - 694.08] allergy and your body's attacking itself
[690.96 - 698.40] and that's all we're given it's not
[694.08 - 700.72] enough it's just not and you know fine
[698.40 - 702.92] fine if it we can't blame anybody if
[700.72 - 705.36] that cause is unknown but we better at
[702.92 - 707.80] least be honest and get out of denial
[705.36 - 709.32] medical denial that that it's you know
[707.80 - 712.28] that they don't have the answer so we're
[709.32 - 714.36] blaming you that has to be fixed it has
[712.28 - 716.88] to be we have to say look we don't know
[714.36 - 721.12] what causes all this but we have to stop
[716.88 - 723.24] blaming the person we have to because it
[721.12 - 724.80] breaks down their immune system that's
[723.24 - 728.40] what we just talked about in the last
[724.80 - 731.20] immune system show is we talked about
[728.40 - 733.40] that very thing breaking down the immune
[731.20 - 736.80] system with this this
[733.40 - 740.24] misinformation so um there are different
[736.80 - 744.52] levels of psoriasis and eczema you know
[740.24 - 746.00] mild rash crack cracking in the skin
[744.52 - 748.36] different levels of itching different
[746.00 - 752.72] levels of bleeding to mild and to
[748.36 - 755.40] releasees s um so and the thing is is
[752.72 - 757.32] one of the things we have to understand
[755.40 - 760.68] this is important this is an important
[757.32 - 763.56] note there are hundreds of varieties
[760.68 - 766.44] meaning it's not just always the same
[763.56 - 770.12] it's not just different levels there's
[766.44 - 772.48] different varieties of examon psoriasis
[770.12 - 774.64] different different shapes different
[772.48 - 777.28] sizes different patterns different
[774.64 - 780.88] different way it's laid out on the body
[777.28 - 782.92] different levels of of um you know some
[780.88 - 785.24] even if some is some eczema or some
[782.92 - 789.16] psoriasis is really extreme it may not
[785.24 - 791.48] bleed some does you know it's so many
[789.16 - 793.64] different varieties it's not just like
[791.48 - 796.60] oh that's eczema you know that's an
[793.64 - 798.92] umbrella word for a 100 varieties of
[796.60 - 803.08] eczema I'm not exaggerating on that by
[798.92 - 806.44] the way I'm not 100 varieties of eczema
[803.08 - 808.44] I am not exaggerating that is serious I
[806.44 - 811.44] mean that's how many different varieties
[808.44 - 813.80] there are as far as with exim alone and
[811.44 - 816.12] psoriasis it's not just pla psoriasis
[813.80 - 818.92] and and serotic arthritis you know and
[816.12 - 820.40] different psor that involves with um
[818.92 - 821.64] arthritis and non- arthritis and
[820.40 - 823.60] everything else and not even just that
[821.64 - 827.44] there's there's not those two varieties
[823.60 - 829.72] or three varieties we're talking there
[827.44 - 833.32] is over a 100 with psoriasis
[829.72 - 836.12] 2 that's how many so we have to kind of
[833.32 - 838.32] do we just we just have to be open to
[836.12 - 840.44] this and to know this we can't just bury
[838.32 - 842.44] it and hide it like it doesn't exist now
[840.44 - 844.72] the reason why it's not talked about so
[842.44 - 846.28] much is because it'll confuse the bear
[844.72 - 847.68] it'll confuse everybody and they'll be
[846.28 - 849.72] like well what is it there 100
[847.68 - 851.88] medications then how come there's not
[849.72 - 854.72] 100 medications for 100 different
[851.88 - 856.20] eczemas the reason why it's the only
[854.72 - 858.92] medication for eczema is an
[856.20 - 861.48] immunosuppressive or a steroid so they
[858.92 - 863.92] no one cares in the Medical Science and
[861.48 - 866.84] medical research world no one really
[863.92 - 868.96] cares to identify different kinds the
[866.84 - 870.64] different shapes different sizes all the
[868.96 - 873.48] different varieties because they're just
[870.64 - 875.68] going to give a steroid out anyway or an
[873.48 - 878.80] IM immunosuppressive uh drug they're
[875.68 - 881.44] just going to hand something out and
[878.80 - 882.88] sure you know these things can Aid at
[881.44 - 885.52] different times when we're we're in
[882.88 - 887.24] crisis when we don't know how to deal
[885.52 - 889.32] with it when we don't know how to handle
[887.24 - 893.28] it and we don't know what we need to do
[889.32 - 895.12] for it of course you know the we we
[893.28 - 896.64] could use these things at different
[895.12 - 899.04] times in our life and I've seen them
[896.64 - 900.96] help people when they couldn't be helped
[899.04 - 902.88] because they weren't they weren't given
[900.96 - 906.24] the information they weren't given what
[902.88 - 909.24] they were supposed to do but the reason
[906.24 - 911.48] why a 100 varieties is not
[909.24 - 913.48] identified is because that very reason
[911.48 - 917.52] is because they don't have anything to
[913.48 - 920.96] offer it's just one drug or two drugs
[917.52 - 922.80] and that's it so why go crazy and trying
[920.96 - 925.40] to really look into this with research
[922.80 - 927.36] and Science and fund and funding and
[925.40 - 929.44] getting a lot of immunologist on board
[927.36 - 932.96] and figuring things out it's just it's
[929.44 - 935.48] just not worth it for the industry so um
[932.96 - 939.60] but it's worth it to get the answers and
[935.48 - 942.36] to get us in a better place so let's get
[939.60 - 946.20] down to the truth you know fasten your
[942.36 - 948.36] seat belts I'm with you on this ride and
[946.20 - 950.68] we're going to get down to it so if you
[948.36 - 953.32] just logged on we're going into it right
[950.68 - 955.64] now and if you just logged on you got to
[953.32 - 959.60] go back and and to the archive and hear
[955.64 - 963.60] the beginning of the show you have to so
[959.60 - 967.36] the real cause and the foundation to it
[963.60 - 971.68] all ecam and psoriasis stems from the
[967.36 - 973.68] liver but it's more than just the liver
[971.68 - 975.32] and I'm going to explain so we have to
[973.68 - 976.80] kind of have our thinking caps on
[975.32 - 979.08] because this is going to get a little
[976.80 - 981.72] bit more complexed um spirit's
[979.08 - 983.60] information can can do that I try to I
[981.72 - 986.84] try to deliver spirit's information in
[983.60 - 989.72] the best way I can um to try you know
[986.84 - 991.28] try to over complicate something so we
[989.72 - 994.40] have to hang on for this one that's what
[991.28 - 997.44] I mean by fasten your seat belt so the
[994.40 - 1000.40] truth is it stems from the liver that's
[997.44 - 1005.24] where the cause or that's where it all
[1000.40 - 1008.44] begins it's a liver condition the reason
[1005.24 - 1011.00] this is not on the radar of medical
[1008.44 - 1015.04] research and medical science is because
[1011.00 - 1016.60] it's not a liver disease okay so you
[1015.04 - 1019.36] have to understand how Medical Research
[1016.60 - 1022.08] Medical Science Works um if it's not a
[1019.36 - 1024.28] liver disease that's easily detected
[1022.08 - 1026.12] with what they use already and not
[1024.28 - 1030.08] creating something to detect what's
[1026.12 - 1033.60] really happening then it's not on the
[1030.08 - 1038.32] radar but it's a it's a liver issue it
[1033.60 - 1040.20] stems from the liver that's what causes
[1038.32 - 1044.68] this condition but we're going to go
[1040.20 - 1046.88] into it deeper it's more than that okay
[1044.68 - 1048.96] and and what happens is when you know
[1046.88 - 1052.40] the doctor tests your liver function he
[1048.96 - 1054.80] sees it's normal that doesn't mean there
[1052.40 - 1056.80] isn't a problem when they're checking
[1054.80 - 1058.64] for like liver enzymes cuz that really
[1056.80 - 1060.60] doesn't play that much of a role into
[1058.64 - 1062.44] psorasis or EXA until things have gotten
[1060.60 - 1064.52] too bad and I'm going to tell you what
[1062.44 - 1066.88] plays the most role what plays the
[1064.52 - 1068.20] biggest this biggest part of it so like
[1066.88 - 1070.76] I said if the doctor finds you know
[1068.20 - 1072.72] liver enzyme and the function is going
[1070.76 - 1075.92] good it's not going to be enough to
[1072.72 - 1079.60] uncover the deeper more complicated
[1075.92 - 1083.16] issues regarding the liver that creates
[1079.60 - 1086.60] eczema and psoriasis or both or one of
[1083.16 - 1090.40] them I've seen people with both so what
[1086.60 - 1093.88] is wrong with the liver of someone who
[1090.40 - 1095.96] is dealing with eczema and
[1093.88 - 1099.12] psoriasis what is
[1095.96 - 1101.56] wrong well it's a specific group of
[1099.12 - 1105.08] toxins that are not known to
[1101.56 - 1107.60] Conventional or alternative medicine and
[1105.08 - 1109.84] will not be singled out for at least
[1107.60 - 1112.68] another 30 years or
[1109.84 - 1115.44] more but everyone
[1112.68 - 1118.32] here I'm sure doesn't have the 30 years
[1115.44 - 1120.40] to wait for even the discovery so we're
[1118.32 - 1124.88] going to learn about this today right
[1120.40 - 1127.52] now this specific group of toxins is
[1124.88 - 1129.88] called a dermatoxin that's what it's
[1127.52 - 1132.04] called a dermatoxin that's what they're
[1129.88 - 1135.64] going to call it down the road
[1132.04 - 1138.72] dermatoxin now you know that a
[1135.64 - 1144.12] dermatoxin is a toxin that surfaces only
[1138.72 - 1146.88] to the skin and injures the Derma the
[1144.12 - 1149.84] Deep Derma tissue okay that's what the
[1146.88 - 1153.44] dermatoxin is I've talked about
[1149.84 - 1155.84] neurotoxins a lot neurotoxins come from
[1153.44 - 1158.68] viruses such as Epstein bar virus or
[1155.84 - 1161.84] shingles or hhb6 or ceglar virus and
[1158.68 - 1164.92] others neurotoxins inflame and affect
[1161.84 - 1169.12] the nervous system in the body causing
[1164.92 - 1173.28] fatigue anxiety depression pain tingles
[1169.12 - 1176.00] and numbness burning Etc okay that's a
[1173.28 - 1179.56] neurotoxin so that's different so I want
[1176.00 - 1181.80] you to know that so you know spirit's an
[1179.56 - 1183.64] expert at neurotoxins and has been
[1181.80 - 1185.56] talking about neurotoxins long before
[1183.64 - 1187.40] they were talked about I remember being
[1185.56 - 1191.32] 10 years old and telling someone they
[1187.40 - 1193.28] had neurotoxins from Spirit neurotoxins
[1191.32 - 1196.48] that was like basically an alien ship
[1193.28 - 1197.76] Landing because never mind 30 years ago
[1196.48 - 1199.28] telling somebody that they're allergic
[1197.76 - 1201.32] to weed
[1199.28 - 1203.04] that was like an alien ship Landing okay
[1201.32 - 1205.44] because meaning talking about blowing
[1203.04 - 1208.84] somebody's mind out 30 35 years ago or
[1205.44 - 1210.68] more and so um so just imagine saying
[1208.84 - 1212.80] neurotoxin out of a 10-year-old and
[1210.68 - 1215.44] that's that's what I'm saying it's it's
[1212.80 - 1218.16] but dermat toxins this is a whole
[1215.44 - 1220.88] another game now I'm releasing this
[1218.16 - 1222.20] first time here today and you know I
[1220.88 - 1224.56] thought about it and I said you know
[1222.20 - 1227.24] everybody just needs to know so the
[1224.56 - 1228.84] dermato toxins go to the skin it's
[1227.24 - 1230.60] different than the
[1228.84 - 1232.32] neurotoxin so I talked about the
[1230.60 - 1233.92] neurotoxin for a second I have to go
[1232.32 - 1235.68] back to that a little bit just so you
[1233.92 - 1240.44] know there's a difference the
[1235.68 - 1244.16] neurotoxin is a virus that's eating a
[1240.44 - 1246.28] specific food it likes it could and or a
[1244.16 - 1249.96] specific type of metal like for instance
[1246.28 - 1254.24] if a virus like Epstein bar um feeds off
[1249.96 - 1257.12] of mercury it goes to bathroom releases
[1254.24 - 1260.08] a neurotoxin it's like a methyl
[1257.12 - 1261.56] neurotoxin and that neurotoxin causes
[1260.08 - 1263.04] all kinds of tingles and numbness it
[1261.56 - 1265.00] causes all kinds of other stuff
[1263.04 - 1266.76] depression anxiety it inflames the
[1265.00 - 1269.68] nerves causes
[1266.76 - 1272.44] vertigo you name it and that's what it
[1269.68 - 1275.52] does okay so that's a neurotoxin so
[1272.44 - 1278.32] dermato toxins are different they go to
[1275.52 - 1282.64] the skin they don't go to the nervous
[1278.32 - 1285.92] system so deep underneath the skin in
[1282.64 - 1289.32] the Derma at the bottom base basically
[1285.92 - 1290.84] it starts there's it's like a dermatoxin
[1289.32 - 1294.12] acts as a
[1290.84 - 1296.84] Venom and these toxins are highly
[1294.12 - 1300.92] inflammatory the skin tries to release
[1296.84 - 1302.64] the Toxin and may crack and bleed in the
[1300.92 - 1305.04] event that it's trying to do this it's
[1302.64 - 1308.64] trying to eliminate the Toxin and that
[1305.04 - 1310.36] even hurts even more okay that's how it
[1308.64 - 1311.80] works the neurotoxin is created by a
[1310.36 - 1314.48] virus like I told you that you know
[1311.80 - 1317.04] epine bar that eliminates the poison
[1314.48 - 1321.64] it's neurotoxic a
[1317.04 - 1324.40] dermatoxin is also created by a
[1321.64 - 1326.44] pathogen but here's the difference so
[1324.40 - 1328.16] understand this so we have the liver
[1326.44 - 1330.72] remember when I said that I said the
[1328.16 - 1335.36] liver is where it all stems
[1330.72 - 1338.84] from okay well the liver has a pathogen
[1335.36 - 1341.12] in it it doesn't have to be a specific
[1338.84 - 1344.40] pathogen that's what's interesting about
[1341.12 - 1346.04] this with psoriasis and um eczema so a
[1344.40 - 1348.68] pathogen sits in the
[1346.04 - 1350.72] liver and it's a
[1348.68 - 1354.08] and it creates a
[1350.72 - 1357.00] dermatoxin by consuming
[1354.08 - 1358.72] copper you got to understand that by
[1357.00 - 1363.12] consuming
[1358.72 - 1368.24] copper that's how examen psoriasis is
[1363.12 - 1371.36] created it's from a bug consuming and
[1368.24 - 1373.76] eliminating copper you won't find that
[1371.36 - 1375.60] on the internet you just won't find that
[1373.76 - 1377.04] there and you won't find a lot of things
[1375.60 - 1378.76] that that I've discovered on and off
[1377.04 - 1381.64] over the years to with Spirit through
[1378.76 - 1384.88] spirit and this one here you're not
[1381.64 - 1388.24] going to find there either and but this
[1384.88 - 1391.80] is the real root cause I mean this is
[1388.24 - 1394.12] exactly the root cause it's a pathogen
[1391.80 - 1396.40] that is consuming copper wait till you
[1394.12 - 1398.32] hear this in the
[1396.40 - 1401.20] liver
[1398.32 - 1405.40] okay and that
[1401.20 - 1408.88] copper is also in the liver due to
[1405.40 - 1410.28] pesticides and herbicide exposure
[1408.88 - 1415.64] that are not
[1410.28 - 1418.24] new so I repeat not new so okay sure if
[1415.64 - 1419.52] you go and eat some conventional produce
[1418.24 - 1421.36] um which we're going to talk about next
[1419.52 - 1423.64] show by the way I think the next show if
[1421.36 - 1425.92] you eat conventional produce and there's
[1423.64 - 1427.20] some residue somewhere in there like if
[1425.92 - 1428.36] you have some grapes and it's on the
[1427.20 - 1430.76] skin of the
[1428.36 - 1434.24] grape and you have that
[1430.76 - 1438.36] pesticide you know it can add into it
[1434.24 - 1441.32] over time but it's not the root cause
[1438.36 - 1445.40] it's from copper and a
[1441.32 - 1446.56] pesticide from Generations past it's
[1445.40 - 1450.20] from your
[1446.56 - 1452.44] parents parents it's from your
[1450.20 - 1456.00] grandparents
[1452.44 - 1457.92] grandparents okay that's what it's from
[1456.00 - 1460.52] it's from
[1457.92 - 1464.96] DDT starting from
[1460.52 - 1468.36] 1874 that's what it's from okay
[1464.96 - 1470.76] and even though DDT was was really put
[1468.36 - 1475.48] into high use in
[1470.76 - 1478.96] 1939 it's its forefathers were from 1874
[1475.48 - 1481.72] and being used and being used widely so
[1478.96 - 1485.56] you have to understand this goes back to
[1481.72 - 1489.28] 1874 prior 1874 psoriasis and and and
[1485.56 - 1493.20] and um psoriasis and eczema was rare
[1489.28 - 1497.28] when I mean rare barely existed and what
[1493.20 - 1500.12] existed of it was from copper poisoning
[1497.28 - 1502.08] from copper
[1500.12 - 1504.88] pipes copper
[1502.08 - 1508.04] pipes and things of that nature that
[1504.88 - 1510.80] were just being developed you know
[1508.04 - 1513.48] basically um and the industries copper
[1510.80 - 1516.84] exposure copper poisoning from the
[1513.48 - 1521.40] industries but the Xmen psoriasis
[1516.84 - 1523.24] boom came out of the pesticide World
[1521.40 - 1527.12] starting in
[1523.24 - 1528.92] 1874 okay and has been passed down from
[1527.12 - 1530.60] our parents parents to their parents to
[1528.92 - 1532.20] their parents and sometimes you know
[1530.60 - 1534.52] depending how long someone lives it
[1532.20 - 1537.12] could be a more than a few Generations
[1534.52 - 1538.40] depending on I mean you know if they
[1537.12 - 1540.00] haven't lived that long in certain
[1538.40 - 1542.72] aspects of the family line then it could
[1540.00 - 1547.64] be multiple Generations between 1874 on
[1542.72 - 1550.92] and even earlier and so this is the root
[1547.64 - 1554.00] the root it's also why babies have
[1550.92 - 1556.84] eczema they have copper in the
[1554.00 - 1559.56] liver copper in the liver and the
[1556.84 - 1562.28] pathogens from the parents and from the
[1559.56 - 1566.84] parents and it from being passed down
[1562.28 - 1570.52] now the problem here is the copper stops
[1566.84 - 1573.32] the pesticide or the old DDT from
[1570.52 - 1576.60] degrading it stops it from degrading
[1573.32 - 1581.20] This is complicated stuff basically the
[1576.60 - 1583.44] copper stops the rest of the pesticide
[1581.20 - 1585.64] from minimizing and minimizing and
[1583.44 - 1588.20] minimizing so that it becomes less and
[1585.64 - 1591.04] less so exen cisis Fades away our world
[1588.20 - 1592.88] it doesn't fade away because the copper
[1591.04 - 1594.76] stops it from degrading and every
[1592.88 - 1599.24] generation pass
[1594.76 - 1601.92] down you see how it works so and then
[1599.24 - 1603.16] when there's a pathogen consuming copper
[1601.92 - 1605.92] in the
[1603.16 - 1608.04] liver including copper we can collect
[1605.92 - 1610.00] even more you know from copper pipes in
[1608.04 - 1612.64] houses drinking water out of copper
[1610.00 - 1614.24] pipes or if we're getting too many
[1612.64 - 1616.92] pesticides in us that still have copper
[1614.24 - 1619.48] in it to some degree if we're adding to
[1616.92 - 1622.84] it it doesn't help we're adding new
[1619.48 - 1625.08] stuff to it but it's mostly from old old
[1622.84 - 1627.08] times it's passed down generation to
[1625.08 - 1628.56] generation this is the confusion of
[1627.08 - 1631.36] medical research and medical science
[1628.56 - 1632.24] saying it's hereditarian your genes that
[1631.36 - 1636.80] that's the
[1632.24 - 1640.88] confusion I mean that's how it
[1636.80 - 1643.88] works this is simplistic really I mean
[1640.88 - 1645.88] we're just not there yet so let's suffer
[1643.88 - 1647.80] for another hundred years for I mean
[1645.88 - 1650.20] that's really medical research and IAL
[1647.80 - 1651.56] science can't come down to the basics
[1650.20 - 1653.80] they do it with heart surgery though
[1651.56 - 1656.12] I'll tell you and they can REM remove
[1653.80 - 1658.52] aneurysms out of the brain good and they
[1656.12 - 1659.72] can fix broken bones like they never did
[1658.52 - 1661.88] before and they could put a lot of
[1659.72 - 1663.92] screws and a lot of rods in you that we
[1661.88 - 1667.72] need and a lot of you know a lot of
[1663.92 - 1669.88] titanium rods they can do amazing work
[1667.72 - 1671.24] so you know and if your gallbladder is
[1669.88 - 1672.96] about to explode because you haven't
[1671.24 - 1676.20] taken care of yourself and you're eating
[1672.96 - 1678.04] too many fried foods and yeah I mean if
[1676.20 - 1680.56] we need the gallbladder out they're
[1678.04 - 1682.36] they're there and they're ready so don't
[1680.56 - 1684.24] get me wrong when when I really get
[1682.36 - 1685.56] snarky about things but when it comes
[1684.24 - 1687.84] down to chronic illness and the
[1685.56 - 1690.12] suffering we have problems we have holes
[1687.84 - 1692.08] in the whole whole thing there's cracks
[1690.12 - 1694.88] in the sidewalk everything is slipped
[1692.08 - 1697.24] through and that's what we're really you
[1694.88 - 1699.60] know airing out so we'll talk about this
[1697.24 - 1702.80] copper thing again so this is from old
[1699.60 - 1705.32] Generations passed down this is from DDT
[1702.80 - 1707.72] from Generations passed down the copper
[1705.32 - 1709.40] keeps the DDT from degrading and other
[1707.72 - 1713.48] pesticides from
[1709.40 - 1715.28] degrading and this is how it works so um
[1713.48 - 1718.12] and if we collect outside sources it
[1715.28 - 1720.04] doesn't help and if we're hard on our
[1718.12 - 1723.16] liver anyway so say you're someone with
[1720.04 - 1725.64] exra examon orias and you end up getting
[1723.16 - 1728.88] a pre- fatty liver because of your diet
[1725.64 - 1732.28] on top of everything thing it only makes
[1728.88 - 1733.56] it worse and compiles it and makes it
[1732.28 - 1737.04] more
[1733.56 - 1738.92] difficult and that's the problem there
[1737.04 - 1741.12] so
[1738.92 - 1743.20] what here's here's also how it works so
[1741.12 - 1745.88] I told you about the the hereditary
[1743.20 - 1747.44] factor and and how it gets passed down
[1745.88 - 1751.80] from relatives and relatives and that's
[1747.44 - 1754.72] how we get the same issue okay and um
[1751.80 - 1758.08] but there's also it also works like this
[1754.72 - 1758.92] um when the when the toxin surface to
[1758.08 - 1762.64] the
[1758.92 - 1765.40] skin everybody's different so a lot of
[1762.64 - 1767.04] times the patterns change and pathogens
[1765.40 - 1769.40] are sometimes different in different
[1767.04 - 1771.80] people too so in a family line you can
[1769.40 - 1774.00] have a different pathogen in the liver
[1771.80 - 1775.80] consuming the copper and the old
[1774.00 - 1777.72] pesticides that won't degrade from
[1775.80 - 1780.00] generation after generation after
[1777.72 - 1782.36] generation and will get different
[1780.00 - 1784.16] markings on the body the reason why
[1782.36 - 1786.00] someone has these little spots tiny
[1784.16 - 1788.12] little spots with eczema another person
[1786.00 - 1791.48] has large patches another person has
[1788.12 - 1793.40] entire one patch it's just all red just
[1791.48 - 1795.80] everywhere another person has like
[1793.40 - 1797.60] skin-like leather because it's all there
[1795.80 - 1800.40] another person has you know one type of
[1797.60 - 1802.84] psoriasis that flakes off and and breaks
[1800.40 - 1806.00] another kind doesn't do it at all but
[1802.84 - 1809.88] just you know swells up it's all these
[1806.00 - 1812.24] differences matter to how much of what
[1809.88 - 1814.36] variety of pesticides in the liver
[1812.24 - 1815.64] mostly containing to Old DDT from the
[1814.36 - 1818.96] old days let me tell you about what they
[1815.64 - 1821.28] used to do with DDT in the old days um
[1818.96 - 1822.84] they used to spray it in the streets and
[1821.28 - 1825.56] they used to wash the streets down with
[1822.84 - 1827.76] it that's what they used to do they used
[1825.56 - 1829.64] to wash the parks down with it they used
[1827.76 - 1831.36] to spray the entire parks while the kids
[1829.64 - 1833.56] were playing in it that's what they used
[1831.36 - 1836.24] to do just with trucks just come by with
[1833.56 - 1838.40] a truck and hose the entire park down
[1836.24 - 1840.80] while kids were CH children were playing
[1838.40 - 1843.68] in the suds and bathing in the suds of
[1840.80 - 1846.60] it that's what they did not only was it
[1843.68 - 1848.00] all over food like pesticides are today
[1846.60 - 1849.72] you know which are bad of course the
[1848.00 - 1851.80] pesticides today are bad Not only was it
[1849.72 - 1855.16] over food but it was considered a
[1851.80 - 1857.40] nutritional supplement so if it was on
[1855.16 - 1860.12] your Apple then you were going to get
[1857.40 - 1863.32] healthier you there were signs in the
[1860.12 - 1866.68] markets with a child eating an apple
[1863.32 - 1869.16] okay and and a can of DDT spray next to
[1866.68 - 1870.84] it saying DDT is good for me so we're
[1869.16 - 1873.12] talking about it was it was out of
[1870.84 - 1875.36] control that's our psoriasis and ezema
[1873.12 - 1877.28] problem of today that's the big part
[1875.36 - 1879.32] that's developed over the years now of
[1877.28 - 1882.08] course our pesticides today they're
[1879.32 - 1884.40] they're no better and they add to it and
[1882.08 - 1886.76] add to it it's just that we're not as
[1884.40 - 1888.92] saturated with them as much for the most
[1886.76 - 1890.60] part unless you're getting your lawn
[1888.92 - 1892.20] sprayed and you're doing other things
[1890.60 - 1894.20] and getting your house sprayed with
[1892.20 - 1896.04] insecticides so if you're someone with
[1894.20 - 1898.12] eimon the first thing you got to do you
[1896.04 - 1901.24] have to eat as organic as you can I mean
[1898.12 - 1903.08] do you do the best you can that's I mean
[1901.24 - 1904.56] w with the ability that you have that's
[1903.08 - 1905.48] the first thing you do second thing you
[1904.56 - 1908.20] do is you make sure there's no
[1905.48 - 1911.00] insecticides being sprayed in your
[1908.20 - 1914.28] house don't worry about the ants you
[1911.00 - 1917.24] leave the ants don't worry don't worry
[1914.28 - 1920.52] about the ants okay and just or whatever
[1917.24 - 1922.48] it is okay just don't worry because it
[1920.52 - 1924.96] can be a lot worse you keep on getting
[1922.48 - 1926.12] those sprays inside the house so that's
[1924.96 - 1929.92] a big deal
[1926.12 - 1931.52] too um all this matters now the reason
[1929.92 - 1933.40] why there's different levels of it like
[1931.52 - 1935.20] I said is there's different levels of
[1933.40 - 1937.44] the pesticide different levels of the
[1935.20 - 1941.12] ancient DVT from our forefathers there's
[1937.44 - 1943.52] different levels of copper and they're
[1941.12 - 1945.28] different pathogens so it makes up for a
[1943.52 - 1947.44] complicated process for medical research
[1945.28 - 1950.80] and medical science to ever really
[1947.44 - 1952.76] through they don't like to go there it's
[1950.80 - 1954.32] just way too much funding way too much
[1952.76 - 1956.36] money to figure out the different levels
[1954.32 - 1958.96] of what people have in their liver what
[1956.36 - 1961.80] pathogen is creating it and what the
[1958.96 - 1963.80] outcome is on the body so it's best to
[1961.80 - 1966.48] just say you're you're at fault you got
[1963.80 - 1970.16] stupid genes okay and that's pretty much
[1966.48 - 1972.60] what it is and or you um or you're just
[1970.16 - 1974.72] you know it's your body attacking itself
[1972.60 - 1977.92] why not why not tell everybody that I
[1974.72 - 1981.64] guess you know so
[1977.92 - 1985.84] exactly right so um so a little bit more
[1981.64 - 1987.80] about how this works um you know the
[1985.84 - 1991.08] alternative world of health so
[1987.80 - 1993.52] functional and alternative world uh
[1991.08 - 1996.80] believes that it's autoimmune and the
[1993.52 - 1999.60] body is attacking itself and um even
[1996.80 - 2002.00] though the alternative world is smart
[1999.60 - 2003.72] about everything meaning smart about
[2002.00 - 2005.88] everything in the sense where hey
[2003.72 - 2007.44] processed food has to go away you know
[2005.88 - 2008.60] you go on healthier Di diet there's
[2007.44 - 2011.00] healthier your vegan diets there's
[2008.60 - 2012.44] healthier your P paleo diets where you
[2011.00 - 2015.80] take out all the garbage you take out
[2012.44 - 2017.72] the fried foods you take out everything
[2015.80 - 2019.36] else you know there's a a food War
[2017.72 - 2020.48] actually going on out there I did a show
[2019.36 - 2022.76] on it I'm going to do another show
[2020.48 - 2025.04] there's a food War got all the Paleo
[2022.76 - 2026.56] people and you know meaning the leaders
[2025.04 - 2029.00] of the Paleo movement and they're just
[2026.56 - 2031.28] they just hate the vegans and you get
[2029.00 - 2033.00] all the plant-based people exactly
[2031.28 - 2035.32] vegans and vetetans all plant-based
[2033.00 - 2038.36] people they they hate the Paleo people
[2035.32 - 2040.80] there's a big war out there um and it's
[2038.36 - 2042.48] not about that you know I I do know that
[2040.80 - 2044.08] you know some paleo diets are helping
[2042.48 - 2046.20] people they take out the processed foods
[2044.08 - 2047.60] they take out the McDonald's they take
[2046.20 - 2049.76] out the fast foods they take out
[2047.60 - 2051.36] everything else and people start getting
[2049.76 - 2053.84] better you know and I know that there's
[2051.36 - 2055.24] the plant-based plant-based world where
[2053.84 - 2056.68] you know everybody's taking out
[2055.24 - 2057.88] everything and and they're getting
[2056.68 - 2060.76] better they're getting better it's
[2057.88 - 2062.64] wherever you feel you have to go to if
[2060.76 - 2065.24] you're not getting the results in one
[2062.64 - 2067.44] angle and first of all you got to give
[2065.24 - 2069.88] it you know a longer test p you have to
[2067.44 - 2073.40] give it longer time and don't give up
[2069.88 - 2075.76] early on trying something new um and you
[2073.40 - 2077.68] know and you can find your way um and
[2075.76 - 2079.32] but eating healthier matters no matter
[2077.68 - 2080.68] what and we're going to do a lot more
[2079.32 - 2082.24] food talk especially with the
[2080.68 - 2084.60] life-changing food book we're going to
[2082.24 - 2086.36] talk about you know all of it and I
[2084.60 - 2090.56] actually laid out in the life-changing
[2086.36 - 2092.88] Foods book a really good chapter on what
[2090.56 - 2096.28] not to eat and why you shouldn't be
[2092.88 - 2097.76] eating it with what illnesses you have
[2096.28 - 2100.64] um and that's whole another area now
[2097.76 - 2104.72] when it comes to psoriasis and it comes
[2100.64 - 2108.36] to eczema your better angle to
[2104.72 - 2110.48] go is actually not just no processed
[2108.36 - 2112.28] foods so it's not just hey keep the
[2110.48 - 2115.16] processed foods away keep the fried
[2112.28 - 2116.68] foods away keep the wheat away when
[2115.16 - 2119.12] you're dealing with Xmen resses you want
[2116.68 - 2120.28] to go all the way over you want to go
[2119.12 - 2122.60] more
[2120.28 - 2124.36] plant-based um and like I said that
[2122.60 - 2126.40] doesn't mean I don't like paleo diets
[2124.36 - 2128.20] that doesn't mean I don't like you know
[2126.40 - 2130.00] whatever eating all the different diets
[2128.20 - 2131.56] that are out there it's not about what I
[2130.00 - 2132.76] like in the end it's about what's right
[2131.56 - 2134.16] for the person what's right for the
[2132.76 - 2136.64] illness it's what's right for what's
[2134.16 - 2138.40] going on and what spirit says that's
[2136.64 - 2140.64] what matters the most because if I start
[2138.40 - 2142.16] thinking of what I like then that's a
[2140.64 - 2145.52] different story people won't get what
[2142.16 - 2146.88] they need it has to come from Spirit so
[2145.52 - 2148.96] when you're dealing with psoriasis and
[2146.88 - 2150.60] eczema you really want to go towards a
[2148.96 - 2152.76] little bit more towards the plant-based
[2150.60 - 2155.04] angles if you're into a lot of animal
[2152.76 - 2156.36] products you want to lower them it
[2155.04 - 2157.92] doesn't mean you have to get rid of them
[2156.36 - 2159.76] all together depending on who you are
[2157.92 - 2163.92] and how severe it is the reason why I
[2159.76 - 2166.04] say this is because in order for the the
[2163.92 - 2168.32] liver to release copper and get the
[2166.04 - 2170.80] copper out and release deep pesticides
[2168.32 - 2173.28] that are in the liver you got to have a
[2170.80 - 2174.96] little bit lower fat so you can do just
[2173.28 - 2177.68] a little bit lower fat you have to lower
[2174.96 - 2179.80] the fats in your diet you know the 28
[2177.68 - 2182.84] day cleanse in the medical medium book
[2179.80 - 2184.72] has really helped thousands with examen
[2182.84 - 2187.48] psoriasis thousands with examen
[2184.72 - 2189.08] psoriasis because it took out the fat
[2187.48 - 2193.12] the high fat including a lot of the
[2189.08 - 2195.28] plant fat and it made it so the liver
[2193.12 - 2198.04] can recover release copper release
[2195.28 - 2200.36] pesticides and the pathogen can actually
[2198.04 - 2201.88] just start to uh break down and have
[2200.36 - 2204.08] nothing to do anymore because it doesn't
[2201.88 - 2206.88] have any food to eat and that's how
[2204.08 - 2209.28] psoriasis and eczema clears up um in
[2206.88 - 2211.00] people um once it's cleared up and
[2209.28 - 2212.28] you're in a great place then you can
[2211.00 - 2214.00] move forward and you can if you want to
[2212.28 - 2215.32] do a healthy paleo diet or you know a
[2214.00 - 2217.04] little bit more animal protein cuz
[2215.32 - 2218.52] that's what you like or that's what
[2217.04 - 2219.84] someone told you as best you could try
[2218.52 - 2223.16] different things you go in different
[2219.84 - 2224.92] directions um but in this situation it's
[2223.16 - 2227.08] important different situations different
[2224.92 - 2228.84] illnesses different complications with
[2227.08 - 2233.08] People's Health you got to do different
[2228.84 - 2235.16] things um so it's uh it it's that
[2233.08 - 2236.28] important as far as the balance of it
[2235.16 - 2238.80] all and that's what we're going to we're
[2236.28 - 2242.04] going to talk about a little bit more um
[2238.80 - 2244.76] the thing is is that with xon and
[2242.04 - 2248.20] psoriasis is that there's Cycles it's
[2244.76 - 2250.04] cyclical so it runs Cycles a lot of
[2248.20 - 2252.88] times when someone's involved you know
[2250.04 - 2255.80] they're in that aimen psoriasis it
[2252.88 - 2257.80] becomes like it starts to clear up and
[2255.80 - 2259.04] then 3 weeks later four weeks later you
[2257.80 - 2261.44] might be one of these people that are
[2259.04 - 2264.08] experiencing this it starts to then come
[2261.44 - 2265.88] back a little bit more but less and then
[2264.08 - 2267.80] starts to clear up come back until
[2265.88 - 2270.36] finally it gets cleared up all together
[2267.80 - 2272.28] so anyone healing from it right now
[2270.36 - 2274.12] realize it's going to kind of come and
[2272.28 - 2275.56] go a little less it's going to be
[2274.12 - 2277.48] cyclical it's going to be doing this
[2275.56 - 2279.64] thing until finally It Go goes away
[2277.48 - 2282.08] completely it's something to understand
[2279.64 - 2283.68] on how it works and then you know you
[2282.08 - 2285.44] get it cleaned up and you can bring back
[2283.68 - 2289.24] other foods but I recom I'm going to go
[2285.44 - 2292.64] over Foods now to what really works um
[2289.24 - 2294.40] for exen psoriasis wild blueberries they
[2292.64 - 2296.52] clean up the liver they bind on to
[2294.40 - 2299.88] Copper they're a big deal I talk about
[2296.52 - 2302.48] wild blueberries all the time papaya
[2299.88 - 2307.36] huge one huge one for eimos
[2302.48 - 2310.28] orasis that's a big deal too um pear s
[2307.36 - 2312.96] that's a big one silly pear you know
[2310.28 - 2315.72] those are really a big deal watermelon
[2312.96 - 2317.80] that's also really important lettuce
[2315.72 - 2319.44] Roma lettuce green leaf lettuce red leaf
[2317.80 - 2322.32] lettuce butter lettuce lettu uses are
[2319.44 - 2325.16] incredible for psoriasis and eczema what
[2322.32 - 2327.44] this means is is if you have say a
[2325.16 - 2329.72] healthy standard American diet but a
[2327.44 - 2332.96] healthy version you want to start you
[2329.72 - 2335.36] know minimizing anything like the grains
[2332.96 - 2337.12] you want to minimize any kind of wheat
[2335.36 - 2339.92] you want to minimize any any kind of you
[2337.12 - 2342.44] know heavy meat you don't want pork if
[2339.92 - 2345.04] you want to do you know some lean meat
[2342.44 - 2347.36] or some like turkey or chicken or fish
[2345.04 - 2349.12] and and bring it down see how it goes
[2347.36 - 2351.04] along the way you know you don't have to
[2349.12 - 2353.60] go crazy or all the way if you don't
[2351.04 - 2355.16] want to but if you're suffering that bad
[2353.60 - 2357.60] you've been living this with this for a
[2355.16 - 2359.32] long time I would do the 28 day cleanse
[2357.60 - 2360.64] I would stay off of all animal products
[2359.32 - 2362.68] for a little while in your life and
[2360.64 - 2365.00] really start cleaning this out and like
[2362.68 - 2366.56] I said it's just you know for the
[2365.00 - 2368.44] process and then you can go back to
[2366.56 - 2372.92] doing what you like or what a good
[2368.44 - 2374.88] practitioner recommends um so spinach
[2372.92 - 2378.00] big that's a big one kale that's a big
[2374.88 - 2380.76] one arugula that's a big one Sprouts
[2378.00 - 2382.56] that's a big one Sprouts clean the liver
[2380.76 - 2384.92] they help heal the liver that's
[2382.56 - 2388.00] incredible important so avocado is
[2384.92 - 2389.60] actually good too watermelon seeds so
[2388.00 - 2391.84] when you eat watermelon you want the
[2389.60 - 2395.20] ones that are seed watermelon seeds are
[2391.84 - 2398.96] incredibly important sweet potatoes
[2395.20 - 2402.76] winter squash that's a big one too um
[2398.96 - 2405.16] incredible FX monis hemp seeds that's
[2402.76 - 2410.16] another one berock root that's another
[2405.16 - 2412.60] one too avoid all grains avoid dairy
[2410.16 - 2415.00] products listen I I understand the
[2412.60 - 2417.44] grass-fed beef butter thing I think it's
[2415.00 - 2419.72] the healthiest butter on the planet I
[2417.44 - 2422.16] understand the yogurts I get it but
[2419.72 - 2424.08] we're talking about psoriasis we're
[2422.16 - 2426.88] talking about Eczema we're not talking
[2424.08 - 2429.04] about food Wars and food belief systems
[2426.88 - 2430.92] okay so you have to understand that so
[2429.04 - 2433.24] anyone out there who's like really big
[2430.92 - 2435.76] on something like their grass-fed butter
[2433.24 - 2437.96] don't get mad at me because it doesn't
[2435.76 - 2440.00] mean I don't like it it just means this
[2437.96 - 2442.88] is something that you know with the
[2440.00 - 2446.44] aasis it can't be there if it's there it
[2442.88 - 2451.60] doesn't help the exis go away that's all
[2446.44 - 2454.72] um so you want no Dairy no eggs eggs you
[2451.60 - 2456.92] don't want with examen sasis it'll keep
[2454.72 - 2459.04] it around forever and it it'll keep the
[2456.92 - 2461.20] copper in the liver and it'll keep the
[2459.04 - 2464.04] old pesticides going all the way back in
[2461.20 - 2467.36] the liver they just won't go away really
[2464.04 - 2470.32] important to understand so um no canola
[2467.36 - 2473.44] oil you know that no canola oil that's
[2470.32 - 2475.52] got to go and like I said before you got
[2473.44 - 2477.68] to lower the animal proteins if you need
[2475.52 - 2479.20] the exis to go wave in more you have to
[2477.68 - 2481.52] eliminate them for a while in your life
[2479.20 - 2483.72] you could bring them back later it's not
[2481.52 - 2485.56] about the belief system it's about
[2483.72 - 2487.48] what's right for the moment at the time
[2485.56 - 2489.32] in your life always have to remember
[2487.48 - 2492.88] that people get really
[2489.32 - 2495.28] upset if I start leaning on one side or
[2492.88 - 2497.76] the other or whatever it is it's not
[2495.28 - 2500.08] about that it's about what's happening
[2497.76 - 2502.72] in your health and what's needed in that
[2500.08 - 2504.24] moment if you had a kidney disease if
[2502.72 - 2506.60] you had a kidney disease or if you were
[2504.24 - 2509.16] on dialysis I would have you remove all
[2506.60 - 2510.52] animal protein because animal protein
[2509.16 - 2513.28] kills the kidneys when you're on
[2510.52 - 2515.20] dialysis it's about what you need and
[2513.28 - 2517.04] then if you're somebody and you don't
[2515.20 - 2518.72] you know and and you can't you know you
[2517.04 - 2521.08] can't you have so many food
[2518.72 - 2523.24] sensitivities and you can't eat anything
[2521.08 - 2525.52] and you got to live off of turkey
[2523.24 - 2529.40] absolutely then you live off a turkey
[2525.52 - 2531.12] I'm for it until the body calms down so
[2529.40 - 2533.20] I'm in there with you no matter what
[2531.12 - 2535.48] it's just about what we need for what we
[2533.20 - 2537.36] need and I have to express this because
[2535.48 - 2540.00] um you know we do we do every now and
[2537.36 - 2542.60] then get someone saying wait a minute
[2540.00 - 2545.36] wait what is he talking about okay so
[2542.60 - 2547.80] you know there's acne which I didn't
[2545.36 - 2549.76] cover a lot didn't cover at all today
[2547.80 - 2552.32] want to talk about cystic acne the cause
[2549.76 - 2554.68] is Strep that's the cause it's the
[2552.32 - 2557.80] bacteria strep strep a cacus that's the
[2554.68 - 2559.80] bacteria that causes acne so when people
[2557.80 - 2562.92] say well it's hormonal it's it's not
[2559.80 - 2566.08] hormonal it's actually strep it's just
[2562.92 - 2568.68] that hormones are steroids and when
[2566.08 - 2570.00] they're out of syn or they're raging
[2568.68 - 2573.32] whether they're out of syn or they're
[2570.00 - 2576.32] raging okay they break down the immune
[2573.32 - 2578.60] system and strep grows rapidly so when
[2576.32 - 2581.96] we're hormonal in different ways in our
[2578.60 - 2583.76] life whatever that angle may be the
[2581.96 - 2587.16] strap a caucus if we have it in our
[2583.76 - 2590.08] system um proliferates it actually grows
[2587.16 - 2591.44] in high abundance and that's so when
[2590.08 - 2592.92] we're going through puberty or we're
[2591.44 - 2595.28] going through when're we're going
[2592.92 - 2597.20] through puberty we're having a serious
[2595.28 - 2599.40] metabolic change in the body we're
[2597.20 - 2601.24] actually the immune system is is not
[2599.40 - 2602.80] getting stronger it weakens for the
[2601.24 - 2604.96] moment actually through puberty it's
[2602.80 - 2607.88] another reason why Epstein bar and mono
[2604.96 - 2610.92] come come so heavily handed in puberty
[2607.88 - 2612.52] and after because we lose all our zinc
[2610.92 - 2615.12] we lose our immune system when we go
[2612.52 - 2616.92] through hormonal changes um same thing
[2615.12 - 2619.28] with pregnancies our immune system drops
[2616.92 - 2621.32] during pregnancies acne comes acne comes
[2619.28 - 2623.04] after delivering a baby acne comes when
[2621.32 - 2626.04] we're pregnant a acne comes when we're
[2623.04 - 2627.88] ovulating acne comes during periods and
[2626.04 - 2629.40] and menstration it's all because these
[2627.88 - 2632.48] are times when the immune system abs and
[2629.40 - 2634.84] flows and drops and lowers and the strep
[2632.48 - 2637.12] that's in the body raises it's a it's a
[2634.84 - 2639.48] balance that happens all the time time
[2637.12 - 2641.00] cystic acne is chronic strep from your
[2639.48 - 2643.04] strep throat you had when you were 3
[2641.00 - 2644.44] years old that you didn't know about
[2643.04 - 2646.96] from that ear infection you had when you
[2644.44 - 2650.16] were 5 years old and it sits in the body
[2646.96 - 2652.04] and it causes the cystic acne so when
[2650.16 - 2653.92] you're dealing with strep we want
[2652.04 - 2655.24] different supplements you want zinc
[2653.92 - 2659.16] that's a critical one when you're
[2655.24 - 2661.12] dealing with STP you want um golden seal
[2659.16 - 2662.64] periodically go to a practitioner talk
[2661.12 - 2665.32] about how you can do some golden seal
[2662.64 - 2667.60] periodically go to an herbalist um you
[2665.32 - 2671.04] want time time tea when you're dealing
[2667.60 - 2673.44] with acne you want um you want lemon

[2678.24 - 2683.20] little bit of maybe some some Cal silver
[2680.92 - 2685.92] Sovereign Silver actually that's the one
[2683.20 - 2687.72] um so silver hydrosols the high quality
[2685.92 - 2690.44] ones you want a little bit of that in
[2687.72 - 2693.36] your life you want lots of vitamin C
[2690.44 - 2695.52] lots and lots and lots of vitamin C and
[2693.36 - 2696.96] foodwise you want to you want to work on
[2695.52 - 2698.68] some of these Foods you want the wild

[2708.12 - 2711.52] that with acne so that's really
[2709.88 - 2713.40] important it's different from psoriasis
[2711.52 - 2716.20] and and eczema psorasis and eczema you
[2713.40 - 2717.84] really have to lower the animal proteins
[2716.20 - 2720.44] um to get the best
[2717.84 - 2722.56] results and but acne you don't have to

[2828.88 - 2831.92] they give out antibiotics left and right
[2830.60 - 2834.36] because someone must have figured out
[2831.92 - 2835.84] it's it's it's bacterial think about
[2834.36 - 2838.72] that how many antibiotics are offered
[2835.84 - 2841.96] for cystic acne so let's just be honest
