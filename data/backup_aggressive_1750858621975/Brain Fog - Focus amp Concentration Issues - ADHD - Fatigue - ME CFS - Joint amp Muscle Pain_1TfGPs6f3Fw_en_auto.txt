[0.32 - 7.20] podcast pharmaceutical
[3.28 - 8.12] exposures everyone is on bleep everyone
[7.20 - 11.28] is on
[8.12 - 13.36] bleep everyone is on bleep even if they
[11.28 - 17.08] don't know what even if they think hey
[13.36 - 19.92] I'm not on any bleeps no way I'm not on
[17.08 - 22.28] any bleeps but they are but they don't
[19.92 - 25.56] realize it pharmaceutical exposure you
[22.28 - 28.48] see pharmaceutical exposure when your
[25.56 - 30.48] own free will isn't in the mix on it
[28.48 - 32.92] Like It's Just Happening any any way
[30.48 - 34.80] you're getting it in you no matter what
[32.92 - 36.80] even if you're like oh no I'm not on
[34.80 - 39.32] Pharmaceuticals I don't take any
[36.80 - 42.52] prescriptions I'm doing good I'm like I
[39.32 - 45.64] don't need any of that you're on it
[42.52 - 48.28] anyway you're on it anyway anyway check
[45.64 - 52.80] out medical Me podcast at Apple podcast
[48.28 - 52.80] pharmaceutical exposures everyone's
[53.08 - 58.68] on everyone's on it so anyway okay we're
[57.16 - 60.28] talking about some symptoms conditions
[58.68 - 62.72] today so I'm excited about this by the
[60.28 - 63.92] way have you got on to the newsletter
[62.72 - 67.12] going to be making an announcement
[63.92 - 68.72] pretty soon about me being somewhere to
[67.12 - 71.00] do a book signing so you don't want to
[68.72 - 73.16] miss that too okay so it's first
[71.00 - 75.96] official book signing ever in all the
[73.16 - 77.36] years I've been doing this and it's
[75.96 - 78.84] exciting because I'm going to be there
[77.36 - 80.68] just bring your books whatever whatever
[78.84 - 82.92] book you have if you have more than one
[80.68 - 85.60] just bring them and I'll just sign it
[82.92 - 87.24] the whole bit so make sure you're on the
[85.60 - 88.84] newsletter so you actually know when
[87.24 - 91.28] that's happening so you can look out for
[88.84 - 93.68] that let's go into this let's get going
[91.28 - 95.08] let's move into it now ADHD do you guys
[93.68 - 98.00] want to talk about that a little bit CU
[95.08 - 100.12] I think it's way worth talking about so
[98.00 - 102.52] many people have it more than ever how
[100.12 - 104.92] many people are on
[102.52 - 107.92] amphetamines how many people are on
[104.92 - 109.52] amphetamines prescribed every day they
[107.92 - 111.08] can't function they wake up in the
[109.52 - 112.80] morning they have to take it it's like
[111.08 - 115.76] their day exists like that they wake up
[112.80 - 118.40] in the morning they can't think and they
[115.76 - 120.12] just have to pop a pel infames they have
[118.40 - 122.20] to go on it right A lot of people people
[120.12 - 124.12] a lot of adults are on it and they're
[122.20 - 125.28] putting children on it too so that's
[124.12 - 129.12] what's happening there let's go into
[125.28 - 132.56] ADHD a little bit okay here's what ADHD
[129.12 - 135.12] isn't it's not genetic and it's not
[132.56 - 136.88] guess what gut related now if that
[135.12 - 139.20] pisses you off anything hang around so I
[136.88 - 144.20] can talk about it a little bit okay but
[139.20 - 147.04] ADHD is not gut related it's not coming
[144.20 - 149.00] from the gut it's in the brain that's
[147.04 - 151.28] where the problem is and there's people
[149.00 - 154.60] with Messy gut guts and they don't have
[151.28 - 157.12] ADHD messy guts their guts are filled
[154.60 - 160.08] with all kinds of different toxins and
[157.12 - 162.88] fungus and everything in mold and
[160.08 - 164.48] garbage and processed food that's caked
[162.88 - 168.04] on the side of their intestinal tract
[164.48 - 171.40] forever no real good bacteria lots of
[168.04 - 173.72] bad bacteria and they don't have ADHD
[171.40 - 176.20] keep that in mind there's a whole ton of
[173.72 - 180.04] those people out there and they don't
[176.20 - 184.24] have ADHD but they have guts that are
[180.04 - 188.16] sloppy messy crudded up fill all kinds
[184.24 - 190.72] of nasty fungus nasty yeast nasty mold
[188.16 - 193.60] nasty bacteria all kinds of different
[190.72 - 196.16] stuff dehydrated stuck feces that have
[193.60 - 198.28] been there for 30 years lining their
[196.16 - 199.92] intestinal tract and colon and they're
[198.28 - 204.64] they don't have
[199.92 - 207.76] ADHD ADHD is not a gut problem it is a
[204.64 - 210.48] brain problem yeah you better believe it
[207.76 - 212.52] your gut better at least be ready to
[210.48 - 215.24] take on some good foods and to take on
[212.52 - 217.84] some good protocols and good things that
[215.24 - 219.60] your gut needs to get it to the brain
[217.84 - 223.20] but your gut isn't the problem that's
[219.60 - 225.16] not where it's stemming from ADHD is in
[223.20 - 228.56] the brain let's go into the little bit
[225.16 - 231.00] okay so ADHD isn't genetic it's not gut
[228.56 - 234.28] rated neither of these popular
[231.00 - 236.76] explanations I got ADHD yeah it's
[234.28 - 239.80] genetic it's in my family line everybody
[236.76 - 242.84] in my family's got it it's genetic right
[239.80 - 244.92] I got ADHD it's gut related I went to
[242.84 - 246.64] the doctor he said it's a gut problem I
[244.92 - 248.36] had a health coach tell me it's gut
[246.64 - 252.00] related that's my
[248.36 - 253.44] ADHD it's not none of these popular
[252.00 - 256.68] explanations addresses the true
[253.44 - 259.60] underlying cause of attentional focus
[256.68 - 262.12] hyperactivity impulsivity or even
[259.60 - 264.52] executive function or selfregulation
[262.12 - 265.96] issues someone I think I just saw it
[264.52 - 268.36] there what book are you reading out a
[265.96 - 270.28] brains saver Incredible Book check it
[268.36 - 273.60] out when you get a chance it's
[270.28 - 275.00] Amazon all right what really causes ADHD
[273.60 - 276.88] is guess what
[275.00 - 278.92] Mercury
[276.88 - 283.04] Mercury and
[278.92 - 285.96] aluminum Mercury and aluminum medical
[283.04 - 289.16] medium information original medical
[285.96 - 291.84] medium information settling in the brain
[289.16 - 296.24] cerebral midline
[291.84 - 299.28] Canal right there right there right in
[296.24 - 300.68] the middle smack in the middle right
[299.28 - 305.24] there
[300.68 - 309.04] metal in an early age settling in the
[305.24 - 314.24] midline canal and then and then as you
[309.04 - 317.08] get older it squeezes it squeezes closed
[314.24 - 318.28] okay so when you're young your midline
[317.08 - 321.72] canals
[318.28 - 324.04] open it's open more it's like this when
[321.72 - 325.92] you're a child and then as you're
[324.04 - 328.88] getting older and your brain is
[325.92 - 331.76] developing it starts to close up just
[328.88 - 333.96] like this see and as it's closing up
[331.76 - 336.08] it's squeezing and holding all that
[333.96 - 339.12] mercury and aluminum that's settled in
[336.08 - 341.00] the midline canal so the goal is to get
[339.12 - 342.96] that out that's critical if you want to
[341.00 - 345.64] get rid of ADHD you have to get the
[342.96 - 347.72] metals out right in the medical medium
[345.64 - 349.40] heavy metal detox is the most popular in
[347.72 - 352.04] the world getting Metals out of people's
[349.40 - 354.68] brains there's a lot of competition now
[352.04 - 357.96] these days you guys trying to get their
[354.68 - 361.28] own metal stuff and hey try my metal
[357.96 - 363.44] thing try my metal REM mover and try I
[361.28 - 364.96] know what it's going on don't do that
[363.44 - 366.68] one don't do the one that's been working
[364.96 - 368.44] on everybody all these years and
[366.68 - 371.56] actually changing their lives and saving
[368.44 - 373.76] their lives anyway if you see that going
[371.56 - 376.20] on anyway the heavy metal detox the
[373.76 - 380.20] medical medium heavy metal detox gets
[376.20 - 384.52] the metals out of the midline canal so
[380.20 - 387.68] that ADHD and other problems are getting
[384.52 - 389.96] better for people okay are getting
[387.68 - 391.32] better for people very important so many
[389.96 - 393.12] people got their lives back because of
[391.32 - 394.84] it all right let's go into a little bit
[393.12 - 396.84] Mercury and
[394.84 - 398.56] aluminum and check this out this is
[396.84 - 402.88] interesting here's some aluminum right
[398.56 - 406.28] there aluminum foil anyone aluminum
[402.88 - 409.00] foil I know you don't eat aluminum foil
[406.28 - 410.64] you don't think you do and there's a lot
[409.00 - 412.40] of aluminum in so many different ways
[410.64 - 415.08] that's just one out of a 100 ways you
[412.40 - 417.16] can get aluminum in your system passes
[415.08 - 418.72] down from generation Mercury passes down
[417.16 - 419.92] from generation to generation to
[418.72 - 421.96] generation
[419.92 - 424.12] mm
[421.96 - 427.64] info mm
[424.12 - 429.04] info okay what really causes ADHD right
[427.64 - 430.36] is the Mercury and aluminum but check
[429.04 - 433.12] this out you guys settling in the
[430.36 - 435.36] midline canal which divides the brain's
[433.12 - 437.08] left hemisphere from the right along
[435.36 - 439.48] with some additional metal sprinkled
[437.08 - 441.24] about like a Christmas tree lighting
[439.48 - 443.60] like Christmas tree lights sprinkled
[441.24 - 445.48] about throughout the brain just a little
[443.60 - 448.80] bit here a little bit there but the
[445.48 - 451.40] midline canal is the big boy right there
[448.80 - 454.04] that's the problem for so many people
[451.40 - 457.96] the same causes
[454.04 - 461.44] autism important to know so very
[457.96 - 464.20] important to know same cause as autism
[461.44 - 467.08] the ratio is a little more aluminum and
[464.20 - 469.84] a little less Mercury when it comes down
[467.08 - 472.56] to ADHD saw another person asked what
[469.84 - 476.12] book it is it is the brainsaver book
[472.56 - 477.92] check it out okay let's go into this
[476.12 - 479.76] when these Metals take up residents in
[477.92 - 482.56] the midline canal when they live live in
[479.76 - 484.48] here when the Mercury and aluminum live
[482.56 - 486.92] in here right there the midline canal do
[484.48 - 489.00] you guys see that they block internal
[486.92 - 491.20] Communications within the brains keep
[489.00 - 493.68] keep in mind what happens is when you
[491.20 - 496.76] have industrialized
[493.68 - 500.08] metal that's in the midline
[496.76 - 501.92] canal it's blocking Communications of
[500.08 - 503.68] the right hemisphere to the left
[501.92 - 505.92] hemisphere Communications that are
[503.68 - 507.80] critical all right so there's so much
[505.92 - 509.60] science and research doesn't know about
[507.80 - 512.24] the brain yet and about how the
[509.60 - 515.60] communication goes the electrical grid
[512.24 - 518.52] the supernatural grid is actually
[515.60 - 521.68] unknown to medical research in science
[518.52 - 524.68] communication that the brain has okay
[521.68 - 527.64] meaning like neurons talking to neurons
[524.68 - 531.04] and then the s Supernatural forces
[527.64 - 533.48] involved with neurons talking to neurons
[531.04 - 536.36] and then the energy fields and then the
[533.48 - 538.68] energy exchange the frequencies the
[536.36 - 540.68] vibrations everything that is in here
[538.68 - 542.48] along with the the soul because that's a
[540.68 - 544.96] whole another aspect of it the soul
[542.48 - 548.88] lives in here and when the soul lives in
[544.96 - 551.28] here you have that so you have the soul
[548.88 - 553.88] and then you have the physical brain but
[551.28 - 556.28] when metals get involved and they're all
[553.88 - 557.84] jammed up in that midline Canal
[556.28 - 560.56] communication between the right
[557.84 - 564.32] Hemisphere and the left hemisphere can
[560.56 - 566.72] go backwards in so many ways all
[564.32 - 569.52] right Communications within the brain as
[566.72 - 572.36] a result the brain must adapt so our
[569.52 - 575.32] brains do adapt and you see it with
[572.36 - 577.40] people if you've paid attention enough
[575.32 - 579.28] to other people and what they're going
[577.40 - 581.72] through and what they're suffering with
[579.28 - 583.60] you can see how they adapt throughout
[581.72 - 585.24] the years if you know somebody long
[583.60 - 587.44] enough or maybe it's a family member and
[585.24 - 590.44] you know them for the rest of your life
[587.44 - 593.56] right okay the brain must adapt and
[590.44 - 596.16] electrical impulses find new avenues so
[593.56 - 600.20] let's talk about that for a second
[596.16 - 603.32] electrical impulses find new avenues
[600.20 - 605.80] important to know all
[603.32 - 610.12] right okay let's hit
[605.80 - 614.32] it all right an electrical impulse let's
[610.12 - 618.60] do a little electrical grid here all
[614.32 - 618.60] right do a little bit of electrical
[619.12 - 624.56] grid there we
[621.16 - 626.20] go okay electrical grid inside your
[624.56 - 631.04] brain right
[626.20 - 631.04] there when you get metal which is all
[632.20 - 635.20] in the midline
[635.84 - 642.12] canal and you get it sprinkled about in
[638.32 - 644.28] different places Mercury
[642.12 - 647.80] aluminum
[644.28 - 649.36] okay what happens is electrical
[647.80 - 651.68] impulses
[649.36 - 653.92] electricity hits the metal and when it
[651.68 - 656.24] hits the metal it has to derail and go
[653.92 - 658.08] somewhere else and when it goes
[656.24 - 660.20] somewhere else it ends up hitting
[658.08 - 662.40] neurons that wasn't supposed to travel
[660.20 - 664.16] through different Avenues it wasn't
[662.40 - 666.64] supposed to travel to so as these
[664.16 - 669.44] electrical impulses this electricity
[666.64 - 672.32] this electrical grid is moving it's
[669.44 - 676.12] hitting into metal right there when it
[672.32 - 678.04] hits into metal it then moves away from
[676.12 - 680.44] the metal it travels a different
[678.04 - 682.56] direction so every time an electrical
[680.44 - 685.00] impulse is cruising here it goes right
[682.56 - 688.12] into the metal grid right there boom
[685.00 - 690.28] into the metal grid ricochets sometimes
[688.12 - 692.92] it goes off to a different avenue it has
[690.28 - 696.00] to find different places to go and
[692.92 - 700.44] that's the adapting people do children
[696.00 - 702.36] do right adults do they adapt some of
[700.44 - 704.52] them have to fight their way through it
[702.36 - 707.40] but they adapt but the electrical
[704.52 - 709.28] impulses end up hitting metal which is
[707.40 - 711.80] the red mark right there and then
[709.28 - 713.88] travels into a different area you see
[711.80 - 715.60] and that's this whole thing where it's
[713.88 - 717.24] it's like that basically when we're
[715.60 - 719.92] suffering with any kind of condition or
[717.24 - 723.48] symptoms whether it's brain f focus and
[719.92 - 724.92] concentration issues however it is it's
[723.48 - 727.56] it's we have to fight through it our
[724.92 - 729.28] brain is fighting through it for us
[727.56 - 731.64] those electrical impulses are going in
[729.28 - 733.92] different places you know so we can
[731.64 - 738.24] actually adapt and somehow survive it
[733.92 - 738.24] and we do we do adapt and we do survive
[738.96 - 744.48] it Aon over there on YouTube I'm doing
[741.96 - 746.84] the obsessive thoughts brain shot as you
[744.48 - 749.52] speak it's so helpful and I am really
[746.84 - 751.84] grateful oh that's incredible brain
[749.52 - 752.60] shots right there oh in the book right
[751.84 - 754.68] here
[752.60 - 756.88] too
[754.68 - 757.88] woohoo okay let's go into this a little
[756.88 - 759.64] bit
[757.88 - 763.00] more all
[759.64 - 765.08] right um and here's the thing what
[763.00 - 767.04] people don't realize when we're dealing
[765.08 - 769.44] with these symptoms and conditions is
[767.04 - 771.80] that there are real reasons why we're
[769.44 - 774.12] dealing with it and we tend to start
[771.80 - 774.88] beating ourselves up so I've seen people
[774.12 - 778.08] with
[774.88 - 780.64] ADHD just beat the crap out of
[778.08 - 782.56] themselves because they're not
[780.64 - 785.08] performing they feel like they're not
[782.56 - 787.44] performing the way they need to they
[785.08 - 789.24] feel they're not they're not doing what
[787.44 - 791.44] they need to do they're judging
[789.24 - 793.48] themselves people are judging them that
[791.44 - 795.96] live with them or that know them and it
[793.48 - 798.24] gets really hard and we get so
[795.96 - 799.92] disconnected to realizing there's
[798.24 - 802.60] actually a real problem and it's not my
[799.92 - 805.04] fault that we end up just beating the
[802.60 - 807.00] crap out of ourselves I've seen that
[805.04 - 809.52] happen for so many people for so many
[807.00 - 811.52] years so you know and if the medication
[809.52 - 813.76] they're taking the amphetamines aren't
[811.52 - 816.36] doing good enough for them then they're
[813.76 - 818.76] really hard on themselves and they just
[816.36 - 821.80] walk around like my ADHD is really
[818.76 - 823.56] acting up my ADHD is really I got ADHD
[821.80 - 825.68] and that's they tell themselves over and
[823.56 - 828.24] over again but really what they have is
[825.68 - 830.40] I got a metal deposit I got Metals in
[828.24 - 832.80] the mid midline canals what they should
[830.40 - 835.12] be knowing I got metal sprinkled about
[832.80 - 836.92] in my brain and I got to get these
[835.12 - 839.88] Metals out because these metals are
[836.92 - 841.88] causing this but people take it on like
[839.88 - 843.92] themselves where they don't know it's
[841.88 - 846.52] the metals they don't know it's
[843.92 - 849.48] something else so then it's them it's
[846.52 - 851.60] them they're the ones so a lot of people
[849.48 - 853.80] are hard on themselves because they're
[851.60 - 858.16] the problem that's what they believe I
[853.80 - 860.56] got ADHD I'm struggling I suck I totally
[858.16 - 863.08] suck and that's what people believe they
[860.56 - 864.36] feel that way they they they push
[863.08 - 865.84] through they push through they take
[864.36 - 867.88] their amphetamines they prescribed
[865.84 - 869.76] amphetamines and they push through and
[867.88 - 871.20] they try to function they try to live
[869.76 - 873.20] their life but they always have this
[871.20 - 875.92] thing kind of hanging over them like I'm
[873.20 - 879.08] just I I'm hard to talk to I get it I
[875.92 - 882.16] got ADHD or I'm having a moment with the
[879.08 - 885.04] ADHD and then they're hard on themselves
[882.16 - 887.08] because they're not focused on what a
[885.04 - 889.32] with the real problem is they weren't
[887.08 - 891.56] enlightened into the real problem they
[889.32 - 893.56] weren't educated on the real problem
[891.56 - 897.24] instead they're educated with you got
[893.56 - 899.88] ADHD that's your problem boy that's your
[897.24 - 901.48] problem and you got to live with it you
[899.88 - 902.92] can try to take some medication if you
[901.48 - 904.36] can you can try to get rid of processed
[902.92 - 906.76] food and try to eat better and maybe
[904.36 - 909.04] it'll improve a little but either way
[906.76 - 911.24] you end up thinking that you're just you
[909.04 - 914.00] got this problem and people when you
[911.24 - 915.76] move that over to like the real problem
[914.00 - 918.44] that's when life changes instantly
[915.76 - 922.72] already it's like wait a minute this
[918.44 - 926.80] isn't me I'm not the ADHD
[922.72 - 929.32] person this isn't me um that's not my
[926.80 - 931.72] identity I'm struggling with toxic heavy
[929.32 - 933.20] metals I need to get that out so then
[931.72 - 936.52] when you're doing the medical medium
[933.20 - 939.72] heavy metal detox and your ADHD is is
[936.52 - 943.28] leaving it's like a rebirth it's like
[939.72 - 945.60] what the heck is going on so many people
[943.28 - 948.12] then they're like reborn it's a
[945.60 - 950.96] religious experience when you can get
[948.12 - 953.76] rid of something like your ADHD and you
[950.96 - 956.32] can get rid of it and it's just
[953.76 - 957.92] religious experience it's like what
[956.32 - 960.00] because you're actually like you're
[957.92 - 962.40] actually hunkering down you're getting
[960.00 - 964.88] disciplined you're doing the heavy metal
[962.40 - 966.68] detox and you're getting better and
[964.88 - 968.80] you're putting it behind you so many
[966.68 - 970.64] people got rid of their ADHD it's not
[968.80 - 972.40] even in their vocabulary anymore they
[970.64 - 974.92] don't even talk about it they moved on
[972.40 - 977.92] with their life there it was way put in
[974.92 - 979.68] the past that's the medical medium
[977.92 - 983.04] information it's just it's just
[979.68 - 985.16] incredible Trish HR says on Facebook so
[983.04 - 987.84] you disagree what science says about it
[985.16 - 989.20] relating to a dopamine deficiency
[987.84 - 991.44] correct
[989.20 - 994.52] I do because the dopamine dopamine
[991.44 - 997.32] deficiency was um was a theory they
[994.52 - 999.84] don't have any way to prove it I mean
[997.32 - 1003.56] look if science can prove it if they can
[999.84 - 1005.60] show you all that a dopamine deficiency
[1003.56 - 1007.48] is really happening in somebody's brain
[1005.60 - 1010.12] like could if they could really show you
[1007.48 - 1013.44] and then somehow show you that that
[1010.12 - 1015.12] dopamine deficiency is causing the ADHD
[1013.44 - 1017.80] but they can't right they can't do any
[1015.12 - 1019.72] of that they can't do anything they can
[1017.80 - 1022.84] just write a paper and that's what they
[1019.72 - 1025.00] do so Trish they just write a paper and
[1022.84 - 1026.68] a paper with a theory on it saying you
[1025.00 - 1028.32] know dopamine deficiency they don't have
[1026.68 - 1029.64] a way to test they don't have a way to
[1028.32 - 1033.04] test that that's the
[1029.64 - 1035.20] ADHD and then that's it there's nothing
[1033.04 - 1036.64] there it's like sand through your hands
[1035.20 - 1039.16] right but if they had a way to actually
[1036.64 - 1042.12] show that or prove it or be able to show
[1039.16 - 1045.08] someone somehow that that was it and
[1042.12 - 1046.44] they can present that then yeah I'd be
[1045.08 - 1047.76] open to it I'd be like all right but
[1046.44 - 1049.52] they've never done that doesn't it
[1047.76 - 1051.44] because just like all you know know what
[1049.52 - 1053.52] science is doing for Alzheimer's now
[1051.44 - 1055.92] they're taking medical medium info about
[1053.52 - 1058.76] um Mercury toxic heavy metals being
[1055.92 - 1061.24] responsible for Alzheimer's so now
[1058.76 - 1063.44] they're talking about that now um a
[1061.24 - 1066.12] decade or more later after I've already
[1063.44 - 1069.04] been talking about it teaching about it
[1066.12 - 1071.80] and Publishing information about it so
[1069.04 - 1074.56] now science is like oh we think it could
[1071.80 - 1076.76] be Metals really and they still haven't
[1074.56 - 1079.76] found the metals in the person's brain
[1076.76 - 1081.68] to line it up to actually be Alzheimer's
[1079.76 - 1083.80] keep that in mind it's not like they cut
[1081.68 - 1086.64] somebody's brain open and they found a
[1083.80 - 1089.00] metal deposit and they said hey that's
[1086.64 - 1090.64] the Alzheimer's we have a metal deposit
[1089.00 - 1092.60] in somebody's brain they they're not
[1090.64 - 1095.44] doing that they're just like hearing
[1092.60 - 1097.52] about it because of the books you know
[1095.44 - 1099.76] millions of copies around the world and
[1097.52 - 1102.00] and talking about you know like metals
[1099.76 - 1103.88] and metals and causing Alzheimer's and
[1102.00 - 1105.44] Dementia and then they're hearing about
[1103.88 - 1107.68] it and then they're writing papers
[1105.44 - 1110.00] saying you know we think there might be
[1107.68 - 1112.96] Metals in evolved but they haven't cut
[1110.00 - 1115.84] open somebody's brain they haven't
[1112.96 - 1118.00] discovered a deposit of metal and then
[1115.84 - 1120.28] they haven't lined it up to alzheimer's
[1118.00 - 1124.16] see so yeah that's pretty much where
[1120.28 - 1126.80] we're at so the evolving domestic
[1124.16 - 1129.64] chemical situation you guys that people
[1126.80 - 1132.56] are breathing in every single day from
[1129.64 - 1135.24] treatments on their lawns to fabric
[1132.56 - 1136.96] softeners to detergents to fragrances to
[1135.24 - 1138.16] the scented candles right now you hear
[1136.96 - 1141.32] it all the time right scented candles
[1138.16 - 1143.48] say it's like yep sended candles to all
[1141.32 - 1148.12] the different fragrances perfumes and
[1143.48 - 1151.04] colog those do domestic Invaders Harbor
[1148.12 - 1153.36] more metals they also lower the immune
[1151.04 - 1155.64] system they also have their own toxic
[1153.36 - 1158.36] agents inside of them but what happens
[1155.64 - 1161.24] is those contribute to more Metals
[1158.36 - 1165.52] they're vaporized Metals so fragrances
[1161.24 - 1168.88] are vaporized Metals toxic conventional
[1165.52 - 1170.92] fragrances I'm not talking about like a
[1168.88 - 1175.08] really pure lemon
[1170.92 - 1177.20] oil okay from the Rind of the lemon and
[1175.08 - 1178.84] that's what you're smelling that has
[1177.20 - 1181.04] heavy metals in there I'm not going
[1178.84 - 1183.04] there I'm talking about like the
[1181.04 - 1185.60] fragrances that are just in everyday's
[1183.04 - 1188.92] everyday people's lives the air
[1185.60 - 1190.92] fresheners to the car air fresheners the
[1188.92 - 1193.24] fabric softeners perfumes cologn the
[1190.92 - 1194.68] scented candles to the fungicides
[1193.24 - 1198.36] everything that's thrown on People's
[1194.68 - 1200.44] Clothing all of it combined is filled
[1198.36 - 1202.52] with vaporized metal and so you're
[1200.44 - 1204.84] breathing it in and what happens is with
[1202.52 - 1206.44] children when they have ADHD they
[1204.84 - 1208.68] already have the metals in the midline
[1206.44 - 1210.92] canal they're already struggling they're
[1208.68 - 1213.08] already dealing with Metals right the
[1210.92 - 1215.24] aluminum the Mercury and other metals
[1213.08 - 1218.52] and then on top of that you get all the
[1215.24 - 1220.72] domestic Invaders those exposures and
[1218.52 - 1223.68] breathing in all of those exposures and
[1220.72 - 1226.64] all that metal and then yeah it just
[1223.68 - 1229.68] compiles and worsens and worsens worsens
[1226.64 - 1231.52] things but if somebody wants an answer
[1229.68 - 1234.88] how do I get rid of my ADHD got to get
[1231.52 - 1237.60] the medals out have to it's critical got
[1234.88 - 1242.08] to get them out heavy metal
[1237.60 - 1245.76] detox very important heavy metal detox
[1242.08 - 1249.12] if you want the metals out it's that
[1245.76 - 1251.44] critical and one that is that has a
[1249.12 - 1253.44] track record that has worked for so many
[1251.44 - 1255.20] people that's what matters not new ones
[1253.44 - 1257.48] people put together because they want to
[1255.20 - 1259.72] hop on the bandwagon the train they want
[1257.48 - 1262.32] to make money sell products that's all
[1259.72 - 1264.60] great and all but use a heavy metal
[1262.32 - 1267.08] detox that is known to work for years
[1264.60 - 1268.48] and years and years Dr fwn also don't
[1267.08 - 1271.08] buy the
[1268.48 - 1273.76] neurodiversity um
[1271.08 - 1275.16] celebration it's meant to normalize the
[1273.76 - 1278.32] fact that everyone is having
[1275.16 - 1283.08] neurological problems and Dr Fawn by the
[1278.32 - 1286.12] way is an expert in um in autism expert
[1283.08 - 1288.68] in ADHD expert in so many different
[1286.12 - 1291.12] neuro and brain condition
[1288.68 - 1293.36] so Dr F thank you for being here amazing
[1291.12 - 1296.08] so let's uh let's head to
[1293.36 - 1298.52] another little spot here where are we
[1296.08 - 1301.52] brain fog
[1298.52 - 1304.68] yep brain fog is always worth talking
[1301.52 - 1307.36] about because so many people suffer from
[1304.68 - 1310.12] it to a degree that they feel like
[1307.36 - 1314.00] they've lost their mind and they're
[1310.12 - 1316.96] getting diagnosis now of early early
[1314.00 - 1321.00] Alzheimer's Alzheimer's early dementia
[1316.96 - 1323.36] they're getting diagnosis of early
[1321.00 - 1327.68] diseases and anybody who's asking about
[1323.36 - 1330.28] autism read the uh medical medium
[1327.68 - 1332.56] Secrets right read that book if you can
[1330.28 - 1334.40] the new edition I have it somewhere I
[1332.56 - 1337.36] was looking through it the other day I
[1334.40 - 1340.72] will get it voila magically it appears
[1337.36 - 1343.08] and I have it right here okay so if you
[1340.72 - 1345.64] want to know more about autism check out
[1343.08 - 1348.56] medical medium New
[1345.64 - 1352.24] Edition if you like problem is with
[1348.56 - 1355.12] brain fog is is that it's not like it
[1352.24 - 1357.92] was years ago I used to see like severe
[1355.12 - 1359.28] brain fog cases years ago I used to see
[1357.92 - 1361.72] there's there was a decent amount of
[1359.28 - 1364.48] people with it but for the majority of
[1361.72 - 1369.00] people with brain fog years ago it was
[1364.48 - 1373.80] more mild conditions not as many serious
[1369.00 - 1375.60] now we're in an epic state of emergency
[1373.80 - 1378.36] when it comes down to brain fog there
[1375.60 - 1380.56] are so many people coming down with it
[1378.36 - 1383.80] every single day they get the worst
[1380.56 - 1386.48] brain fog conditions after right see
[1383.80 - 1388.92] after the flu after some kind of you
[1386.48 - 1392.20] know condition like some kind of like
[1388.92 - 1394.28] bug that's going around or stomach flu
[1392.20 - 1396.60] or you neuro virus or something and then
[1394.28 - 1398.28] they have the worst brain fog afterwards
[1396.60 - 1402.08] there's a lot of people triggered into
[1398.28 - 1403.80] it but there's a lot of people that just
[1402.08 - 1405.60] it just happens they wake up in the
[1403.80 - 1408.52] morning and one morning and it's not
[1405.60 - 1410.92] working something is not right
[1408.52 - 1414.08] something's not kind of clicking in and
[1410.92 - 1416.80] then it goes away by 10: in the morning
[1414.08 - 1419.24] or it comes in at 10: in the morning and
[1416.80 - 1421.80] then it goes away at around 1 and then
[1419.24 - 1423.80] it comes in bad at 3: and then they're
[1421.80 - 1425.84] like intermittent brain fog and they're
[1423.80 - 1429.76] in this this state of intermittent brain
[1425.84 - 1432.84] fog and then it's all day every day all
[1429.76 - 1435.24] day every day sometimes really bad
[1432.84 - 1438.32] sometimes not so bad scale one to 10
[1435.24 - 1441.28] well my brain fog is out of three today
[1438.32 - 1443.96] next day my brain fog is out of seven
[1441.28 - 1447.20] the next day my brain fog is out of five
[1443.96 - 1449.84] next day my brain fog is out 11 where I
[1447.20 - 1452.04] can't even focus I can't think I can't
[1449.84 - 1455.56] work I can't do anything so many people
[1452.04 - 1458.16] really suffer from brain fog and they
[1455.56 - 1459.92] really do all right so let's go into a
[1458.16 - 1461.12] little bit severe cases of brain fog can
[1459.92 - 1463.88] be
[1461.12 - 1466.04] devastating indeed
[1463.88 - 1469.40] devastating making people feel like
[1466.04 - 1471.36] they've lost their Minds I'm in brains
[1469.40 - 1473.72] saver guys just reading right out of
[1471.36 - 1476.08] brains saver I'm on page 329 I saw
[1473.72 - 1478.96] somebody asked what page
[1476.08 - 1482.08] 329 so yeah all
[1478.96 - 1484.11] right so I want to show you the
[1482.08 - 1486.28] um other
[1484.11 - 1488.20] [Music]
[1486.28 - 1490.84] books very interesting all right let's
[1488.20 - 1492.84] keep on going even mild brain fog is
[1490.84 - 1495.96] very challenging on the person's mental
[1492.84 - 1498.16] and emotional state I find brain fog
[1495.96 - 1501.04] being one of the most challenging for a
[1498.16 - 1503.76] lot of people and
[1501.04 - 1505.20] um you know it's really really difficult
[1503.76 - 1507.36] for a lot of people can I put this right
[1505.20 - 1509.80] here you guys there we go kind of in in
[1507.36 - 1513.96] every every place
[1509.80 - 1517.80] there heavy metal
[1513.96 - 1521.20] detox can't say it enough get
[1517.80 - 1526.24] better work on it
[1521.20 - 1530.56] heal move past it there is life after
[1526.24 - 1534.36] chronic illness there is okay there is
[1530.56 - 1539.20] life after chronic illness keep that in
[1534.36 - 1542.48] mind never forget that there truly
[1539.20 - 1544.24] is okay even mild brain fog is very
[1542.48 - 1547.20] challenging on the person's mental and
[1544.24 - 1549.88] emotional state one major factor behind
[1547.20 - 1552.04] brain fog is a liver that's saturated
[1549.88 - 1553.88] with a lot of toxic
[1552.04 - 1556.68] metals and
[1553.88 - 1559.52] garbage so there we go got the liver
[1556.68 - 1562.48] again don't lose that
[1559.52 - 1564.24] liver okay livers that get filled up
[1562.48 - 1566.88] with all kinds of junk all kinds of
[1564.24 - 1569.76] different stuff toxic heavy metals are a
[1566.88 - 1571.60] big one right there yep scented candles
[1569.76 - 1575.56] air fresheners fragrances pesticides
[1571.60 - 1578.28] herbicides other toxins providing fuel
[1575.56 - 1582.80] now here's the thing with brain fog
[1578.28 - 1586.60] okay brain fog is a little different
[1582.80 - 1590.68] sometimes where someone is viral and
[1586.60 - 1594.96] toxic viruses in the liver that's the
[1590.68 - 1598.96] liver virus in the liver yes the liver
[1594.96 - 1606.84] Harbors so many viruses Epstein bar cyto
[1598.96 - 1609.80] virus hhv6 hhv7 herpes simplex one HSV 2
[1606.84 - 1612.92] okay undiscovered herpes viruses
[1609.80 - 1615.92] shingles sit inside our liver that's
[1612.92 - 1619.00] where they sit and what they do is they
[1615.92 - 1620.88] eat and feed on the the metals so they
[1619.00 - 1624.20] eat and feed on the metals inside the
[1620.88 - 1626.76] liver and then they release a neurotoxin
[1624.20 - 1629.32] and that neurotoxin goes into the
[1626.76 - 1632.72] bloodstream and floats
[1629.32 - 1636.00] around and gets all through the body and
[1632.72 - 1639.16] then it hits the brain and then we short
[1636.00 - 1643.20] circuit and then we got brain
[1639.16 - 1645.28] fog all right the epin bar virus feeds
[1643.20 - 1647.84] on these poisons the neurotoxins it
[1645.28 - 1652.32] releases explode through the bloodstream
[1647.84 - 1656.52] and spinal fluid and from there they can
[1652.32 - 1660.92] cross get ready the blood brain
[1656.52 - 1665.00] barrier due to their unique infiltration
[1660.92 - 1668.36] quality they can trojen horse it into
[1665.00 - 1671.16] your brain they can cross the blood
[1668.36 - 1674.16] brain barrier they can trojen horse it
[1671.16 - 1676.44] in there that's what they do okay they
[1674.16 - 1678.84] enter into the brain they shortcircuit
[1676.44 - 1682.40] neurons when once again we're in that
[1678.84 - 1685.08] place where the neurons are all short
[1682.40 - 1686.84] circuiting Rooney Lee says I'm noticing
[1685.08 - 1690.28] more of my friends getting brain fog
[1686.84 - 1692.72] after a sickness yes it lasts for them
[1690.28 - 1696.04] it lasts for them long after they're
[1692.72 - 1699.04] sick yes Rooney totally and and I see
[1696.04 - 1703.88] that all the time let me explain why
[1699.04 - 1708.76] okay so all right you catch the
[1703.88 - 1711.24] flu you get it you're sick with a fever
[1708.76 - 1715.20] you're dealing with the flu you got
[1711.24 - 1718.36] congestion your body is overrun by flu
[1715.20 - 1721.24] viruses they are proliferating and
[1718.36 - 1725.24] exploding your immune system has to
[1721.24 - 1727.88] battle those flu viruses that's your
[1725.24 - 1730.24] immune cells right there's the flu
[1727.88 - 1733.76] viruses a war
[1730.24 - 1737.52] ensues okay many of your white blood
[1733.76 - 1740.60] cells your immune cells and killer cells
[1737.52 - 1742.92] get destroyed in the process many of
[1740.60 - 1745.20] them are lost in the battle and as
[1742.92 - 1747.40] they're battling the flu virus it's
[1745.20 - 1750.92] that's happening right there the immune
[1747.40 - 1754.12] cell dies and you lost another immune
[1750.92 - 1757.16] cell and then many of the immune cells
[1754.12 - 1759.88] are actually killing the flu virus see
[1757.16 - 1762.52] and eating the flu virus until it's gone
[1759.88 - 1764.16] and then die themselves your immune
[1762.52 - 1767.48] cells die
[1764.16 - 1769.64] themselves because the flu made you lose
[1767.48 - 1774.68] half your immune system or
[1769.64 - 1777.84] more something decided to rise
[1774.68 - 1782.36] up something rose
[1777.84 - 1783.84] up it was another virus that was sitting
[1782.36 - 1787.32] inside the
[1783.84 - 1790.12] liver percolating and living in there
[1787.32 - 1792.56] having a good time whether it was
[1790.12 - 1795.00] dormant or just a little bit post
[1792.56 - 1797.56] dorment and then after the flu when you
[1795.00 - 1799.84] losing your half of your immune system
[1797.56 - 1801.52] battling the flu viruses and your immune
[1799.84 - 1806.20] cells
[1801.52 - 1807.36] died the virus rose up and that virus
[1806.20 - 1810.56] Epstein
[1807.36 - 1814.12] bar most of the time Epstein
[1810.56 - 1816.56] bar is having its day and then it's
[1814.12 - 1820.00] feeding on things it likes to feed on
[1816.56 - 1820.96] poisons toxins toxic heavy metals eggs
[1820.00 - 1823.04] as
[1820.96 - 1825.56] well
[1823.04 - 1828.04] eggs and when it feeds on those eggs
[1825.56 - 1829.92] because you're having eggs I don't want
[1828.04 - 1832.72] to drop that
[1829.92 - 1835.64] egg what happens is that it's releasing
[1832.72 - 1838.80] more poisons and toxins those toxins and
[1835.64 - 1838.80] poisons go to the
[1838.84 - 1843.96] brain and we end up short
[1841.20 - 1846.28] circuiting and where we end up sicker
[1843.96 - 1848.00] than we were before I was talking about
[1846.28 - 1852.52] this long before the
[1848.00 - 1854.60] 2019 20 long before the 2020
[1852.52 - 1858.56] pandemic I've been talking about this
[1854.60 - 1861.40] long before that so it's long flu and
[1858.56 - 1864.32] that's what it is you get the flu or you
[1861.40 - 1867.64] get the neuro
[1864.32 - 1870.56] virus you get some kind of bug it knocks
[1867.64 - 1873.36] your immune system down a war ensues
[1870.56 - 1874.88] your immune cells die and when they die
[1873.36 - 1878.08] because they're trying to save your life
[1874.88 - 1879.68] and they're beating down viruses then a
[1878.08 - 1882.96] different virus that's been hidden in
[1879.68 - 1886.52] you set aega virus Epstein bar hhv6
[1882.96 - 1888.52] hhv7 shingles Rises up most of the time
[1886.52 - 1891.16] Epstein bar virus that's the one that's
[1888.52 - 1893.16] the opportunist in the situation Rises
[1891.16 - 1897.16] up and now you're sicker with other
[1893.16 - 1900.04] problems long after your flu long after
[1897.16 - 1901.96] all that so yeah very
[1900.04 - 1906.48] interesting
[1901.96 - 1909.24] okay over there on YouTube I own a Gaba
[1906.48 - 1911.80] and celery Force help my brain fog so
[1909.24 - 1917.84] much they do I recommend it to friends
[1911.80 - 1921.68] all the time I do I do I do okay
[1917.84 - 1924.12] okay MTO cery Force for brain
[1921.68 - 1926.64] fog
[1924.12 - 1929.08] yep I agree all right let's get into
[1926.64 - 1931.32] this because we got some stuff to cover
[1929.08 - 1933.96] okay when upar feeds on these poisons
[1931.32 - 1936.52] the neurotoxins it releases explode
[1933.96 - 1938.88] through the bloodstream spinal fluid
[1936.52 - 1941.20] cross the bloodb brain barrier you have
[1938.88 - 1943.76] now brain
[1941.20 - 1946.16] fog and then short circuiting of the
[1943.76 - 1949.20] neurons happens and then damaged
[1946.16 - 1950.28] neurotransmitter occur these neurotoxins
[1949.20 - 1951.64] have the ability to diminish
[1950.28 - 1953.88] neurotransmitter activity and
[1951.64 - 1955.44] neurotransmitter chemicals themselves
[1953.88 - 1957.00] basically your neur neurotransmitter
[1955.44 - 1959.60] chemicals start to diminish and then
[1957.00 - 1962.88] you're in worse
[1959.60 - 1965.56] shape Kate Courtney says I got brain fog
[1962.88 - 1969.60] and you were the only one who saved me a
[1965.56 - 1973.88] blessing led me to your first book right
[1969.60 - 1976.76] as it was released and I knew I found
[1973.88 - 1978.00] the truth thank you he here's my first
[1976.76 - 1980.76] book
[1978.00 - 1983.60] it's a new edition that's
[1980.76 - 1985.76] it all
[1983.60 - 1987.28] right the electrical impulse was
[1985.76 - 1988.92] carrying messages and thoughts and
[1987.28 - 1992.68] information so let's cover that really
[1988.92 - 1992.68] quick all right
[2004.52 - 2008.96] so yep
[2015.48 - 2019.72] all
[2016.92 - 2022.88] right so your brain right
[2019.72 - 2024.52] here okay electrical impulses are
[2022.88 - 2027.60] carrying information so all that
[2024.52 - 2030.32] electricity going through your
[2027.60 - 2031.84] brain all that electricity going through
[2030.32 - 2035.24] your
[2031.84 - 2039.76] brain is carrying
[2035.24 - 2042.16] information I was just thinking you know
[2039.76 - 2046.04] right when it snows
[2042.16 - 2048.72] outside how pretty it is the snowflakes
[2046.04 - 2051.92] are coming down do you ever see like the
[2048.72 - 2055.16] big snowflakes they're coming down and
[2051.92 - 2058.28] the temperatur is somewhere around 32°
[2055.16 - 2061.04] 33° and the big snowflakes are just
[2058.28 - 2062.24] floating down and they look like they're
[2061.04 - 2066.24] about to
[2062.24 - 2067.40] melt and when they land on your hand
[2066.24 - 2070.84] they're half
[2067.40 - 2073.12] melted and it feels cold but yet it's
[2070.84 - 2077.84] not that cold
[2073.12 - 2082.64] outside and the air smells so fresh and
[2077.84 - 2082.64] clean right okay all
[2083.08 - 2088.72] right electricity is carrying
[2086.32 - 2090.60] information throughout your brain
[2088.72 - 2091.60] electricity is carrying information
[2090.60 - 2094.08] throughout your
[2091.60 - 2098.36] brain so
[2094.08 - 2103.28] I I love the winter
[2098.36 - 2107.20] and like I really like the snow
[2103.28 - 2112.32] um you know like when when it's get gets
[2107.20 - 2115.68] cold outside and the snowflakes when
[2112.32 - 2117.12] they're they're bigger do you ever see
[2115.68 - 2121.16] them like
[2117.12 - 2123.60] melt like I talked to somebody recently
[2121.16 - 2125.80] and that's what they said to me and I
[2123.60 - 2128.76] knew they meant everything that I just
[2125.80 - 2132.56] said and they couldn't get it out their
[2128.76 - 2135.24] brain fog was so bad the electricity was
[2132.56 - 2138.32] hitting metal and toxins everywhere they
[2135.24 - 2139.96] had so many neurotoxins in their brain
[2138.32 - 2142.00] and they were trying to tell
[2139.96 - 2144.52] me
[2142.00 - 2146.12] that what they really wanted to say
[2144.52 - 2148.08] because I sat there and I talked to them
[2146.12 - 2150.16] and I talked to them for like 45 minutes
[2148.08 - 2152.16] for like an hour and I talked all about
[2150.16 - 2154.60] I said take your time tell me what you
[2152.16 - 2159.20] mean tell me what you want to say and
[2154.60 - 2163.36] the person who used to talk perfectly
[2159.20 - 2166.16] fine talked great articulate anything
[2163.36 - 2167.52] actually really smart person a genius
[2166.16 - 2170.36] could not
[2167.52 - 2172.60] explain properly how they felt
[2170.36 - 2174.84] emotionally how they felt about the air
[2172.60 - 2176.80] being so crisp and clean how they felt
[2174.84 - 2179.12] about the snowflakes how they just start
[2176.80 - 2181.08] to melt how the temperature was about 33
[2179.12 - 2182.72] degrees really highly intelligent person
[2181.08 - 2184.44] that wanted to talk about temperatures
[2182.72 - 2185.88] fluctuations of temperatures and
[2184.44 - 2187.36] different weather patterns and the
[2185.88 - 2189.88] snowflakes into different sizes and
[2187.36 - 2192.08] shapes right all that and they couldn't
[2189.88 - 2194.92] even get it out and they literally were
[2192.08 - 2198.16] in tears and said aw that's why I need
[2194.92 - 2199.92] to know like I there somebody I haven't
[2198.16 - 2202.12] talked to in years that I knew 20 years
[2199.92 - 2204.28] ago and they reached out to me and
[2202.12 - 2206.08] they're like I can't even tell you what
[2204.28 - 2207.76] I'm going through right now and I'm like
[2206.08 - 2209.72] I know what you're going through I I
[2207.76 - 2212.20] know I understand yes I'm not in your
[2209.72 - 2214.96] shoes and I'm not living with that but
[2212.20 - 2218.36] but I know I do know the spirit of
[2214.96 - 2221.80] compassion just allows me to know I I I
[2218.36 - 2223.32] since I was a child so and this person
[2221.80 - 2225.16] this person couldn't even get that out
[2223.32 - 2227.76] and the brain fog was taking over and
[2225.16 - 2229.96] taking over they had a rest that's it
[2227.76 - 2232.40] after that 45 minutes of talking they
[2229.96 - 2235.88] were in bed and they were done for the
[2232.40 - 2238.56] day that was it the brain fog was so bad
[2235.88 - 2241.00] and this was post having a really bad
[2238.56 - 2244.08] flu like a month ago six weeks ago
[2241.00 - 2246.80] whatever it was terrible terrible so
[2244.08 - 2248.24] electrical impulses electricity is going
[2246.80 - 2249.80] through the brain carrying information
[2248.24 - 2251.72] so it's carrying that snowflake
[2249.80 - 2253.60] information or what do you want to talk
[2251.72 - 2255.24] about do you want to talk about
[2253.60 - 2257.08] something that you saw you want to talk
[2255.24 - 2258.48] about some birds you identified and you
[2257.08 - 2260.00] want to you want to tell somebody about
[2258.48 - 2262.96] which birds you like are your favorite
[2260.00 - 2267.20] birds and you want to talk about that so
[2262.96 - 2269.16] you have Birds right you have birds in
[2267.20 - 2270.72] that information what else do you want
[2269.16 - 2272.48] to talk about grocery shopping you were
[2270.72 - 2274.60] at the store you saw some really
[2272.48 - 2276.24] incredible apples right so you're
[2274.60 - 2280.40] looking at these amazing apples so you
[2276.24 - 2282.20] got apples on in your mind right on that
[2280.40 - 2284.52] electrical impulse in that electrical
[2282.20 - 2287.16] impulse going through the neuron you got
[2284.52 - 2288.96] apples information about that the ones
[2287.16 - 2290.48] that you like you like the red apples
[2288.96 - 2293.80] you like whatever Apple that you like
[2290.48 - 2295.60] the Fuji apples the bray burs the Gallas
[2293.80 - 2297.80] all that and what happens is when your
[2295.60 - 2299.88] brain fog is really really bad you won't
[2297.80 - 2301.88] be able to really kind of come across to
[2299.88 - 2304.48] somebody about the gala versus the bray
[2301.88 - 2308.04] bur versus the Fuji versus the honey
[2304.48 - 2310.20] crisp right versus the the Macintosh
[2308.04 - 2314.36] versus the red delicious versus the you
[2310.20 - 2317.08] know the the all the different ones and
[2314.36 - 2319.24] the Granny Smith the green apple and you
[2317.08 - 2320.80] won't even be able to kind of like work
[2319.24 - 2322.56] with that with somebody else like talk
[2320.80 - 2325.00] like you want to talk and that's it
[2322.56 - 2327.48] people go through they suffer with
[2325.00 - 2329.88] severe brain fog where they have to kind
[2327.48 - 2330.84] of shut it down and shut it off where
[2329.88 - 2332.12] they're not going to be able to talk
[2330.84 - 2333.96] about apples they're not going to be
[2332.12 - 2335.92] able to talk about their store trip so
[2333.96 - 2337.56] much what they see or what they saw at
[2335.92 - 2339.48] the Farmers Market Market or how the
[2337.56 - 2341.76] weather is and what they whatever what
[2339.48 - 2345.24] the trip they took they can't go into
[2341.76 - 2347.56] detail and on that electrical you know
[2345.24 - 2350.00] grid right here is all that information
[2347.56 - 2351.80] trapped on it about the birds they saw
[2350.00 - 2353.64] all the information about the food they
[2351.80 - 2356.64] were eating or the food they like and
[2353.64 - 2358.68] they whatever and it's on that grid and
[2356.64 - 2360.28] then that grid short circuits right
[2358.68 - 2362.64] there from neurotoxins it's short
[2360.28 - 2364.60] circuits from all the Epstein bar
[2362.64 - 2366.96] neurotoxins from other metals in the
[2364.60 - 2370.04] brain and as it short circuiting
[2366.96 - 2372.16] they're starting to run their adrenals
[2370.04 - 2375.24] it's not their fault but their adrenals
[2372.16 - 2377.36] start to crank up okay here they here
[2375.24 - 2381.08] they are lost
[2377.36 - 2383.72] them and they start to sweat people with
[2381.08 - 2386.84] a lot of brain fog
[2383.72 - 2390.00] sweat when they're talking to someone or
[2386.84 - 2392.60] trying to convey something or articulate
[2390.00 - 2394.64] something or get something across
[2392.60 - 2397.08] especially if it's emotional if it's
[2394.64 - 2399.12] emotional they start to get wrenched
[2397.08 - 2400.84] their armpits get
[2399.12 - 2403.44] filled
[2400.84 - 2405.48] because adrenaline is actually kicking
[2403.44 - 2407.08] in adrenaline's kicking in because
[2405.48 - 2408.88] there's a problem in the brain there's
[2407.08 - 2412.00] something wrong in the brain there's a
[2408.88 - 2414.00] short circuit so really bad brain fog a
[2412.00 - 2416.04] short circuit
[2414.00 - 2418.76] happens and when that short circuit
[2416.04 - 2420.96] happens because metals and neurotoxins
[2418.76 - 2422.76] are interfering with electrical impulses
[2420.96 - 2424.84] electrical activity and when that's
[2422.76 - 2427.12] happening they're short circuiting and
[2424.84 - 2429.08] it's making them nervous
[2427.12 - 2432.12] and they're struggling and then their
[2429.08 - 2434.08] adrenals start to release
[2432.12 - 2436.20] adrenaline and that adrenaline is
[2434.08 - 2439.24] rushing through their body because they
[2436.20 - 2441.08] have to convey a message and they're
[2439.24 - 2445.28] upset and they're
[2441.08 - 2450.48] emotional and then they get wet their
[2445.28 - 2450.48] armpits fill with water they start to
[2451.88 - 2458.32] sweat happens all the
[2455.32 - 2458.32] time
[2458.76 - 2463.64] Tekk says oh my God on YouTube oh my God
[2460.68 - 2466.00] aw that's me when I try to communicate
[2463.64 - 2468.68] with others it's difficult to get my
[2466.00 - 2471.84] words out thank you for all you
[2468.68 - 2471.84] do all
[2471.96 - 2478.32] right I'm really sorry you go through
[2474.08 - 2482.04] that by the way I really am sorry all
[2478.32 - 2484.56] right over there you're speaking you're
[2482.04 - 2486.84] speaking to me a w I would struggle to
[2484.56 - 2488.68] find words to speak
[2486.84 - 2493.04] wasn't even able to find things in my
[2488.68 - 2497.40] own house it was that bad only and only
[2493.04 - 2501.60] medical medium info helps me when I
[2497.40 - 2501.60] suffered to death it's
[2501.84 - 2508.16] awful I'm so glad that the information
[2504.84 - 2511.12] is helping it's moving you forward thank
[2508.16 - 2514.64] God anelia says this is me I can't
[2511.12 - 2516.60] recount anything I don't sweat but it's
[2514.64 - 2518.88] so hard and I feel frustrated ated
[2516.60 - 2521.84] because I remember the feeling of what
[2518.88 - 2526.56] happened but not
[2521.84 - 2529.72] details I understand I
[2526.56 - 2532.76] do yeah we're in brain fog a little bit
[2529.72 - 2532.76] more and then we're going to move
[2532.92 - 2537.92] on all right these neurotoxins have the
[2536.24 - 2539.48] ability to diminish neuro
[2537.92 - 2541.32] neurotransmitter activity and
[2539.48 - 2544.52] neurotransmitter chemicals themselves
[2541.32 - 2546.60] meaning that when an electrical impulse
[2544.52 - 2548.20] electrical impulse tries to run down a
[2546.60 - 2550.16] neuron the electrical impulse can
[2548.20 - 2552.20] misfire and it's approaching any kind of
[2550.16 - 2554.08] contamination so it misfires in short
[2552.20 - 2557.24] circuits that's what
[2554.08 - 2559.48] happens another factor in brain fog is a
[2557.24 - 2563.88] high toxic heavy metal
[2559.48 - 2567.12] load yes within the brain itself that's
[2563.88 - 2569.92] a brain loaded with Metals that's
[2567.12 - 2572.16] another form of brain fog you can have
[2569.92 - 2575.12] both you can have
[2572.16 - 2578.76] both keep that in mind you better
[2575.12 - 2581.24] believe it okay here's a metal deposit
[2578.76 - 2585.84] right there here's a metal deposit right
[2581.24 - 2588.92] there aluminum Mercury lead cadmium
[2585.84 - 2591.44] arsenic right metal
[2588.92 - 2593.80] deposits you can have a bad case of
[2591.44 - 2597.28] brain fog or you can have metal
[2593.80 - 2599.92] sprinkled about like this Christmas tree
[2597.28 - 2603.40] types of of metal sprinkled
[2599.92 - 2606.64] about you can have different Metals all
[2603.40 - 2609.36] sprinkled about in the brain there you
[2606.64 - 2613.20] go
[2609.36 - 2615.28] okay toxic heavy
[2613.20 - 2618.84] metals
[2615.28 - 2621.52] metals that can get us in trouble big
[2618.84 - 2621.52] time let's move
[2622.44 - 2625.44] on
[2626.32 - 2629.80] okay celery
[2629.84 - 2634.72] juice I got some celery
[2632.72 - 2637.64] juice by the way a little grapefruit
[2634.72 - 2640.32] juice today
[2637.64 - 2642.36] needed a little glucose right
[2640.32 - 2647.28] there to
[2642.36 - 2650.24] um get me pumped up all right let's
[2647.28 - 2653.04] go focus and concentration
[2650.24 - 2656.20] issues let's hit that a little bit one
[2653.04 - 2658.12] source of focus and concentration issues
[2656.20 - 2661.32] is along the lines of what you read
[2658.12 - 2663.40] about in the ADHD section heavy metals
[2661.32 - 2666.20] such as mercury and aluminum in the
[2663.40 - 2667.76] cerebral midline Canal sprinkle
[2666.20 - 2669.48] throughout the brain as well or both
[2667.76 - 2674.52] when metals reside in the brain they
[2669.48 - 2676.24] often dampen dampen electrical activity
[2674.52 - 2678.32] causing the brain to try to adapt by
[2676.24 - 2681.08] increasing electrical output which
[2678.32 - 2683.84] brings on temporary bouts of
[2681.08 - 2685.48] clarity that results in overheating so
[2683.84 - 2686.60] then the brain must go into extreme
[2685.48 - 2688.16] cooling so we're going to talk about
[2686.60 - 2690.64] overheating cooling the whole bit so I'm
[2688.16 - 2694.32] in this book right here brain
[2690.64 - 2694.32] saver brain
[2694.96 - 2698.76] saver
[2696.80 - 2700.80] okay which ends up reducing electricity
[2698.76 - 2702.64] act activity leading someone to
[2700.80 - 2706.68] flip-flop back to moments of poor
[2702.64 - 2708.88] concentration so cooling heating cooling
[2706.68 - 2711.24] heating cooling
[2708.88 - 2713.80] heating this is interesting right here
[2711.24 - 2717.08] about focusing concentration okay our
[2713.80 - 2720.00] brains get hot and then they quickly
[2717.08 - 2723.80] cool then they get hot again then they
[2720.00 - 2723.80] quickly cool that's what they
[2724.88 - 2730.12] do
[2727.28 - 2730.12] our brain gets
[2735.84 - 2741.92] hot
[2737.96 - 2743.80] right okay that's what happens and
[2741.92 - 2747.00] sometimes our brain gets hot certain
[2743.80 - 2748.52] area just here our brain gets hot in
[2747.00 - 2751.00] this area right
[2748.52 - 2754.88] here heats up heats
[2751.00 - 2756.40] up then starts to cool
[2754.88 - 2759.92] down
[2756.40 - 2761.80] see this
[2759.92 - 2765.12] fluctuating you're
[2761.80 - 2767.68] focused you're focused you're getting
[2765.12 - 2767.68] focused
[2767.76 - 2774.60] again heats up heats up heats
[2771.00 - 2777.28] up you're losing concentration you can't
[2774.60 - 2780.28] focus anymore cooling down cooling down
[2777.28 - 2780.28] cooling down cooling
[2780.36 - 2786.00] down okay
[2782.92 - 2789.20] right you're getting focused you're
[2786.00 - 2792.32] getting focused it's coming into Clarity
[2789.20 - 2795.76] you can think you can actually talk
[2792.32 - 2798.16] think you're hanging in there heating up
[2795.76 - 2801.04] heating up heating up got a problem
[2798.16 - 2804.88] though got a problem cooling down
[2801.04 - 2807.12] cooling down cooling down can't focus
[2804.88 - 2809.60] losing concentration losing
[2807.12 - 2812.40] concentration okay trying to give an
[2809.60 - 2814.80] example of kind of how it
[2812.40 - 2816.56] works because having toxic heavy metals
[2814.80 - 2818.40] in the brain could could cause a lot of
[2816.56 - 2821.76] different things to happen one is
[2818.40 - 2825.24] Extreme heating extreme cooling
[2821.76 - 2828.16] fluctuations of heating cooling heating
[2825.24 - 2831.96] cooling and then we're all over the map
[2828.16 - 2834.76] we are all over the map emotional we're
[2831.96 - 2837.16] like we're focused we're there and then
[2834.76 - 2839.16] we're we lost our focus our
[2837.16 - 2841.72] concentration we're somewhere else we're
[2839.16 - 2844.24] somewhere else now or we're now really
[2841.72 - 2847.04] emotional or we're less emotional we can
[2844.24 - 2849.56] be everywhere in any where Right Heating
[2847.04 - 2851.60] and Cooling happens inside the brain
[2849.56 - 2854.32] because metals and the electrical Grid
[2851.60 - 2857.68] in some people this whole Supernatural
[2854.32 - 2859.56] thing happens physically and right not
[2857.68 - 2862.04] physically and it happens spiritually
[2859.56 - 2865.96] and physically and it's a mesh a whole
[2862.04 - 2866.92] mesh of emotions of physical information
[2865.96 - 2869.76] in the
[2866.92 - 2872.44] neurons information that's in the
[2869.76 - 2874.36] soul there's a lot of heating there's a
[2872.44 - 2876.48] lot of emotional output and then there's
[2874.36 - 2879.12] a lot of cooling and and it's up and
[2876.48 - 2880.80] down all of
[2879.12 - 2883.20] it
[2880.80 - 2885.20] okay when metals reside in the brain
[2883.20 - 2886.84] they often dampen Electric electrical
[2885.20 - 2888.84] activity causing the brain to try to
[2886.84 - 2892.08] adapt by increasing electrical output
[2888.84 - 2895.04] which brings in bouts of clarity Heating
[2892.08 - 2897.20] and then boom cooling which ends up
[2895.04 - 2899.72] reducing electrical activity leading
[2897.20 - 2901.96] someone to flip-flop back to moments of
[2899.72 - 2905.12] poor concentration where you're
[2901.96 - 2908.08] flip-flopping like I got Clarity I lost
[2905.12 - 2911.08] it I had Clarity an hour ago I lost it
[2908.08 - 2913.64] now now I'm struggling I had Clarity
[2911.08 - 2917.16] this morning before my coffee I drank
[2913.64 - 2919.68] all my coffee had you know had Clarity
[2917.16 - 2921.04] boom and then after my coffee later on
[2919.68 - 2923.20] when everything just kind of like I
[2921.04 - 2927.04] don't know when my caffeine ran out no
[2923.20 - 2927.04] Clarity anymore no Focus no
[2928.36 - 2934.56] concentration no focus and concentration
[2931.40 - 2936.16] issues can also come from a chronic
[2934.56 - 2940.36] viral in
[2936.16 - 2944.24] infection okay chronic viral
[2940.36 - 2946.32] infection viruses love to eat they love
[2944.24 - 2949.28] to eat this delicious cheddar cheese I
[2946.32 - 2952.68] have right here they love cheddar
[2949.28 - 2955.24] cheese so when people eat cheddar cheese
[2952.68 - 2956.68] the viruses will love to feed on it
[2955.24 - 2959.88] sometimes it takes years and then
[2956.68 - 2961.36] finally boom it's just they fed on
[2959.88 - 2963.24] cheese every now and then when you're
[2961.36 - 2964.68] eating it and fed on more cheese every
[2963.24 - 2967.40] now and then when you eat it and then
[2964.68 - 2969.96] the virus is proliferated they
[2967.40 - 2971.84] multiplied they came out of dormy they
[2969.96 - 2974.72] got hungrier and
[2971.84 - 2976.72] hungrier and so cheese and dairy
[2974.72 - 2980.72] products will feed
[2976.72 - 2983.20] viruses they will they will over time
[2980.72 - 2984.84] butter will feed viruses over
[2983.20 - 2987.60] time
[2984.84 - 2989.92] see Western says over there on YouTube I
[2987.60 - 2993.88] almost never have coffee but when I do
[2989.92 - 2997.84] my brain lights up and I can talk so
[2993.88 - 3001.36] easily had my coffee Cofe but a day
[2997.84 - 3004.20] later I'm depressed and tired oh man I'm
[3001.36 - 3008.88] depressed I'm
[3004.20 - 3011.72] tired yep I understand all right let's
[3008.88 - 3015.16] go let's move let's move move move let's
[3011.72 - 3017.40] keep it going
[3015.16 - 3019.56] um there a lot of a lot of good comments
[3017.40 - 3023.12] coming up okay why does that
[3019.56 - 3026.72] happen you had your coffee and your
[3023.12 - 3031.40] adrenaline acted as an amphetamine
[3026.72 - 3034.16] guess what an amphetamine does okay CU
[3031.40 - 3036.64] your coffee is like a daily
[3034.16 - 3040.52] amphetamine every day people have their
[3036.64 - 3040.52] amphetamine through their caffeine
[3041.60 - 3045.16] right and then then there's people that
[3044.04 - 3049.28] are taking
[3045.16 - 3050.56] amphetamines okay I won't list them all
[3049.28 - 3053.48] but there's a bunch of them when they
[3050.56 - 3057.16] take their amphetamines guess what it
[3053.48 - 3060.40] does it ignites
[3057.16 - 3061.76] happiness out of your adrenals it
[3060.40 - 3065.24] ignites
[3061.76 - 3068.88] adrenaline so the reason why we take the
[3065.24 - 3071.80] amphetamine is so our adrenals can go
[3068.88 - 3073.76] boom and then we're focused we're
[3071.80 - 3076.64] feeling better we're feeling like we can
[3073.76 - 3078.52] think we're rising out of our brain fog
[3076.64 - 3081.08] rising out of our
[3078.52 - 3082.84] ADHD rising out of our focus and
[3081.08 - 3085.04] concentration
[3082.84 - 3089.36] problems and then when the amphetamine
[3085.04 - 3093.64] wears off coffee
[3089.36 - 3096.76] chocolate right caffeine Mach tea green
[3093.64 - 3099.56] tea or prescribed amphetamine that your
[3096.76 - 3104.68] doctor gives you when the amphetamine
[3099.56 - 3104.68] wears off and the adrenaline comes
[3105.36 - 3111.88] down we're
[3107.84 - 3114.36] depressed we're sad we're
[3111.88 - 3116.08] depressed we're
[3114.36 - 3118.28] crying
[3116.08 - 3123.44] we're
[3118.28 - 3125.84] miserable many people are just in a dark
[3123.44 - 3128.08] place and then we get back on our coffee
[3125.84 - 3131.12] or caffeine or matcha our chocolate we
[3128.08 - 3133.68] get back on our amphetamines which is
[3131.12 - 3134.92] caffeine and then we or we go and we
[3133.68 - 3137.60] take another
[3134.92 - 3140.16] amphetamine dosage from our doctor's
[3137.60 - 3142.20] amphetamine prescription and we're back
[3140.16 - 3143.80] on top again for a little bit we're
[3142.20 - 3145.76] having a pretty good day we're back on
[3143.80 - 3147.76] top and then adrenaline flooding
[3145.76 - 3150.28] adrenaline's flowing it's flowing and
[3147.76 - 3155.00] then it all comes crashing down and
[3150.28 - 3155.00] we're depressed and down in the
[3157.60 - 3162.88] dumps Max von says over there on YouTube
[3160.40 - 3165.72] when I quit coffee there was a period of
[3162.88 - 3168.48] time when I didn't know if I'd ever feel
[3165.72 - 3168.48] happy
[3168.52 - 3172.92] again it's a struggle it's a struggle
[3172.04 - 3177.40] not
[3172.92 - 3180.80] easy Von says I gave up coffee amazing
[3177.40 - 3183.56] okay all right chronic viral infections
[3180.80 - 3187.36] where viruses such as Epstein bar can
[3183.56 - 3188.84] feed off of toxic heavy metals such as
[3187.36 - 3191.28] mercury and aluminum like we're talking
[3188.84 - 3193.32] about before releasing neurotoxins that
[3191.28 - 3195.40] float around the bloodstream saturating
[3193.32 - 3197.44] neurotransmitter chemicals dampening
[3195.40 - 3199.96] everything when this occurs electrical
[3197.44 - 3203.80] impulses running across neurons short
[3199.96 - 3206.52] circuit because they become polluted
[3203.80 - 3209.36] polluted what's next now occurring is a
[3206.52 - 3211.60] new wave of dangerous chemicals being
[3209.36 - 3212.92] produced every day by the chemical
[3211.60 - 3214.72] industry I'm trying to make it sound as
[3212.92 - 3216.52] interesting as possible because when you
[3214.72 - 3219.04] talk about the chemical IND industry it
[3216.52 - 3220.12] just doesn't sound interesting yeah the
[3219.04 - 3221.68] chemical
[3220.12 - 3225.64] industry
[3221.68 - 3228.92] y they're doing some bad stuff out there
[3225.64 - 3230.20] chemical industry is creating a bunch of
[3228.92 - 3233.52] bad
[3230.20 - 3237.12] chemicals and those bad chemicals are
[3233.52 - 3239.68] hurting our children children hurting
[3237.12 - 3242.28] us but what's now occurring is a new
[3239.68 - 3244.12] wave of these dangerous chemicals the
[3242.28 - 3246.16] chemical industry is pumping this [ __ ]
[3244.12 - 3248.48] everywhere into the environment and our
[3246.16 - 3251.16] children and our pets are ingesting it
[3248.48 - 3254.00] and we inhale it these toxic chemical
[3251.16 - 3256.68] substances are adding to the viral fuel
[3254.00 - 3259.88] keeping us sick because it's like
[3256.68 - 3262.20] breathing in more dosages of
[3259.88 - 3263.48] unauthorized toxic heavy metals that are
[3262.20 - 3267.32] floating through the air and getting
[3263.48 - 3269.56] into our bloodstream in and our
[3267.32 - 3270.76] body glad you guys love to hang around
[3269.56 - 3272.68] for some of this you know we're going
[3270.76 - 3275.88] into this it's either this or just like
[3272.68 - 3277.76] what everybody loves which is five ways
[3275.88 - 3280.60] for
[3277.76 - 3282.48] longevity five best tips for longevity
[3280.60 - 3285.12] CU only everybody has the attention span
[3282.48 - 3286.20] right now of a flea did you notice that
[3285.12 - 3288.04] you guys that everybody has the
[3286.20 - 3289.60] attention span of a flea out there so
[3288.04 - 3293.60] all they like is like quick bioh hacks
[3289.60 - 3296.68] like five five top foods for longevity
[3293.60 - 3299.52] five best ways to stay alive to live to
[3296.68 - 3302.68] 200 years old I like okay I could watch
[3299.52 - 3305.96] that for about 5 seconds or 5
[3302.68 - 3309.08] minutes all right sometimes focus and
[3305.96 - 3313.44] concentration seems to improve randomly
[3309.08 - 3315.52] on its own and sometimes they get worse
[3313.44 - 3317.60] one theory is that the gut has
[3315.52 - 3320.48] everything to do with the brain that's a
[3317.60 - 3322.48] theory out there and so cleaning up the
[3320.48 - 3325.84] gut automatically improves mental
[3322.48 - 3328.04] Clarity yeah that's it this Theory is
[3325.84 - 3330.12] misleading the real reason that someone
[3328.04 - 3331.64] can focus more easily when they start
[3330.12 - 3332.96] eating better is that they're removing
[3331.64 - 3337.60] unhealthy
[3332.96 - 3341.60] foods like viral Foods they're low
[3337.60 - 3344.40] lowering the viral consumption of the
[3341.60 - 3346.00] toxic viral food so what they're doing
[3344.40 - 3348.52] so when they're getting away from
[3346.00 - 3350.64] processed foods that have a lot of bad
[3348.52 - 3352.04] cheese and all the other garbage and
[3350.64 - 3352.96] everything else when they're starting to
[3352.04 - 3355.64] push that
[3352.96 - 3358.04] away and they're pushing away the gluten
[3355.64 - 3360.80] because gluten feeds viruses all of a
[3358.04 - 3362.76] sudden there's a little bit of an
[3360.80 - 3363.44] improvement okay let's go in just a
[3362.76 - 3365.60] little
[3363.44 - 3367.92] bit okay all
[3365.60 - 3369.56] right it's not all about cleaning up the
[3367.92 - 3371.28] intestinal tract and restoring bacterial
[3369.56 - 3372.72] balance to the gut this is why so many
[3371.28 - 3373.84] unhealthy people with very messy
[3372.72 - 3375.68] intestinal tracts filled with
[3373.84 - 3377.64] unproductive yeast and mold and fungus
[3375.68 - 3379.60] never had a focus and concentration
[3377.64 - 3384.36] problem ever
[3379.60 - 3386.60] ever there people with strep sitting
[3384.36 - 3389.36] right there on the outside of their anus
[3386.60 - 3393.76] every single day strep like three kinds
[3389.36 - 3397.80] of strep if they took a Q-tip and stuck
[3393.76 - 3401.72] it in their rectum and try to actually
[3397.80 - 3404.60] grow something in a Petri dish right
[3401.72 - 3406.40] okay get a culture going they would see
[3404.60 - 3410.96] some Fierce
[3406.40 - 3413.04] strep grow from just swabbing the
[3410.96 - 3415.48] Rus and at the same time those people
[3413.04 - 3417.00] don't have Focus concentration issues
[3415.48 - 3418.32] they're just living their life going to
[3417.00 - 3420.88] work doing their job whatever they're
[3418.32 - 3423.16] doing being productive and they have all
[3420.88 - 3425.12] kinds of crap inside their guts and all
[3423.16 - 3427.16] kinds of stuff bacteria and everything
[3425.12 - 3429.48] else in fungus and yeast and mold
[3427.16 - 3432.60] unproductive fungus yeast and mold or
[3429.48 - 3434.96] really bad stuff right SEI and all kinds
[3432.60 - 3436.68] of garbage in there and it's feasting on
[3434.96 - 3437.72] everything and it's just a mess in there
[3436.68 - 3438.88] and they don't want focus and
[3437.72 - 3440.72] concentration you can talk to them and
[3438.88 - 3442.16] they'll just like they'll talk circles
[3440.72 - 3444.12] around
[3442.16 - 3446.80] somebody all right let's move on to the
[3444.12 - 3446.80] next one
[3447.60 - 3450.56] I see lime disease right there we'll

[3522.28 - 3526.80] down on their brain and weighing
[3524.00 - 3528.88] weighing down on their head and brain
[3526.80 - 3530.92] stem and they're just thinking about all
[3528.88 - 3532.08] their different problems they have while

[3756.56 - 3761.56] explained all that extreme fatigue
[3758.64 - 3764.68] that's not from lack of sleep on the
[3761.56 - 3767.44] other hand has an air of mystery about
[3764.68 - 3769.92] it it's that fatigue people get where

[3779.24 - 3784.12] away while it can last for a shorter
[3781.72 - 3786.44] time extreme fatigue is often
[3784.12 - 3791.68] long-term chronic
[3786.44 - 3795.16] fatigue syndrome brutal
[3791.68 - 3798.52] longterm your legs can feel like you got
[3795.16 - 3801.00] rocks tied to them bags of cement on
[3798.52 - 3802.52] your arms you feel like you can't lift
[3801.00 - 3805.96] your
[3802.52 - 3808.20] arms right you feel like you're dragging
[3805.96 - 3810.92] you're just dragging along you know that
[3808.20 - 3814.04] feeling you're just dragging
[3810.92 - 3816.16] along and worse in that you feel like
[3814.04 - 3817.36] everything's shutting down on you I
[3816.16 - 3820.96] don't know if you guys have ever
[3817.36 - 3823.40] experienced it where it's severe CFS
[3820.96 - 3825.04] where you're shutting down you have to
[3823.40 - 3827.72] nap and you're not even sleeping you're
[3825.04 - 3830.52] just shutting down you're still awake
[3827.72 - 3833.00] but you're just shutting down you guys
[3830.52 - 3834.92] know I endorse these guys fery guys know
[3833.00 - 3836.68] I endorse them it's a the best stuff on
[3834.92 - 3838.56] the market hands down I don't care what
[3836.68 - 3842.48] anybody says out there about their supp
[3838.56 - 3844.44] liit being the best sure right no BS
[3842.48 - 3846.08] this is the best stuff there is and
[3844.44 - 3848.96] there's reasons why it is it's
[3846.08 - 3850.64] unbelievable the only company that does
[3848.96 - 3853.08] things like doesn't put all the
[3850.64 - 3855.00] anti-caking agents in there and all that
[3853.08 - 3856.76] stuff that no one tells you about that's
[3855.00 - 3858.72] in all those other supplements I could
[3856.76 - 3860.24] go on forever but I know that that's not
[3858.72 - 3862.64] what this is
[3860.24 - 3864.96] today so you know when it comes down to
[3862.64 - 3867.52] CFS and chronic fatigue syndrome what I
[3864.96 - 3869.24] don't like when I don't like anybody
[3867.52 - 3872.20] suffering or struggling with it at all
[3869.24 - 3873.52] right kicking in by the way I'm just
[3872.20 - 3876.56] starting to feel
[3873.52 - 3878.76] it it's kicking in right now what I
[3876.56 - 3881.40] don't like is when someone gets more
[3878.76 - 3883.68] than the fatigue more than the like the
[3881.40 - 3886.20] lead feel like the lead legs and the
[3883.68 - 3888.28] lead arms they're feeling the fatigue
[3886.20 - 3890.92] where they're shutting
[3888.28 - 3893.16] down they're laying on mattress Island
[3890.92 - 3895.68] not because they're tired yeah they're
[3893.16 - 3898.24] tired but they can't sleep they're
[3895.68 - 3901.88] laying on mattress Island awake but shut
[3898.24 - 3904.52] down like in this place where they can't
[3901.88 - 3906.76] like function they can't talk they're
[3904.52 - 3908.24] just they're just shutting down and they
[3906.76 - 3911.68] have to do that they have to rest their
[3908.24 - 3913.52] nerves for a little while and and then
[3911.68 - 3915.76] they come out of it and they're able to
[3913.52 - 3917.84] function for a little bit and that's
[3915.76 - 3921.68] back to square one again it's such
[3917.84 - 3921.68] serious neurological fatigue it's
[3922.00 - 3926.08] brutal yep
[3926.20 - 3930.48] mhm how fast does celery Force work with
[3928.80 - 3933.56] you guys by the
[3930.48 - 3938.60] way like seriously like how fast is it 8
[3933.56 - 3941.84] minutes 12 minutes 14 minutes 20
[3938.60 - 3944.12] minutes I mean it's always it's always
[3941.84 - 3947.56] for what I've talked to people and for
[3944.12 - 3950.32] me that's between 5 minutes and 20
[3947.56 - 3951.96] minutes it's like between five and 20
[3950.32 - 3955.08] right somewhere in that
[3951.96 - 3957.44] pocket it's insane and it usually hits
[3955.08 - 3959.48] the person at the same timeline too like
[3957.44 - 3961.56] if they're an eight minutter then like
[3959.48 - 3963.64] it hits eight minutes so it's in eight
[3961.56 - 3965.96] minutes if they're a 10-min it's like in
[3963.64 - 3967.64] 10 minutes it's always around 10 minutes
[3965.96 - 3969.72] crazy how that
[3967.64 - 3974.20] works yeah someday I'll talk about it
[3969.72 - 3976.44] more too all right so chronic fatigue
[3974.20 - 3980.32] syndrome big part of it is viral
[3976.44 - 3981.48] infections Epstein bar CYO Aben bar is
[3980.32 - 3984.60] the big one
[3981.48 - 3985.72] shingles all the viral loads that bring
[3984.60 - 3988.60] people
[3985.72 - 3990.88] down but Epstein bar is the big shining
[3988.60 - 3993.04] star though that's the big one for
[3990.88 - 3997.40] CFS and then what comes along with
[3993.04 - 4001.88] Epstein bar is strap so strap and
[3997.40 - 4002.64] Epstein bar their the big ticket winners
[4001.88 - 4005.24] for
[4002.64 - 4008.36] CFS and then if you got chronic fatigue
[4005.24 - 4010.52] syndrome that's really really bad and
[4008.36 - 4011.92] you're dealing with the viral issue and
[4010.52 - 4014.68] the bacterial
[4011.92 - 4016.88] issue and your immune system is dogging
[4014.68 - 4018.88] it your immune cells are dogging it they
[4016.88 - 4021.40] can't keep up with the bacteria the
[4018.88 - 4023.60] strep they can't keep up with the virus
[4021.40 - 4026.84] they can't keep up and then as that's
[4023.60 - 4028.96] happening you might also have metals and
[4026.84 - 4030.84] when you got metals like aluminum and
[4028.96 - 4034.08] Mercury that's just some aluminum foil
[4030.84 - 4036.88] right there couped with all that in your
[4034.08 - 4039.32] body and then the domestic Invaders like
[4036.88 - 4041.60] all the fragrances giving you more stuff
[4039.32 - 4045.44] challenges for the immune system we end
[4041.60 - 4048.32] up with severe severe CR chronic fatigue
[4045.44 - 4049.96] syndrome and yeah Rachel says sorry
[4048.32 - 4053.44] Force makes me
[4049.96 - 4055.12] tired okay but do after that are you one
[4053.44 - 4057.68] of those where it makes you tired like
[4055.12 - 4061.00] the rare one it makes you a little tired
[4057.68 - 4064.44] and then you're more more Sparky later
[4061.00 - 4066.80] it's actually feeding the brain helping
[4064.44 - 4070.08] it to strengthen and then you're more
[4066.80 - 4072.52] Sparky later and have a better day ahead
[4070.08 - 4075.16] of you or a better day the next day
[4072.52 - 4078.44] because it's restoring
[4075.16 - 4081.04] that's really awesome all right or or is
[4078.44 - 4084.00] it something else or is it something
[4081.04 - 4085.92] else that happens you guys incredible so
[4084.00 - 4087.92] we covered a lot of different topics I
[4085.92 - 4092.04] just want to run across a few things by

[4170.20 - 4174.56] hurting we only know why they're hurting
[4173.00 - 4176.52] if they twist their

[4254.48 - 4257.92] medical meme information knows why and
[4256.52 - 4260.16] the books know
[4257.92 - 4262.04] why if someone falls on a knee or
[4260.16 - 4263.68] twisted ankle and experiences aute pain
[4262.04 - 4265.76] it is usually
[4263.68 - 4267.72] straightforward
[4265.76 - 4270.20] straightforward some pain comes from
[4267.72 - 4271.96] injuries accidents or incidents and
[4270.20 - 4274.32] there's no mystery
[4271.96 - 4276.20] involved what's very different is if
[4274.32 - 4278.40] someone experiences chronic fatigue
[4276.20 - 4281.60] sorry chronic pain in the joints or
[4278.40 - 4285.40] muscles with no discernable Source
[4281.60 - 4288.60] magically happens Magic Ally
[4285.40 - 4294.16] appears yeah even if a doctor diagnoses
[4288.60 - 4297.00] someone with ra lupus Lyme disease
[4294.16 - 4298.76] fibromyalgia it's still a mystery joints
[4297.00 - 4301.32] and muscle
[4298.76 - 4304.12] pain someone gives somebody a lupus
[4301.32 - 4307.48] diagnosis or a fibro diagnosis it's
[4304.12 - 4312.64] still a mystery it's mystery joint
[4307.48 - 4315.12] shoulder elbow joint pain muscle pain
[4312.64 - 4318.20] shoulder pain neck neck pain still a
[4315.12 - 4323.48] mystery the real cause of this chronic
[4318.20 - 4325.96] pain chronic mystery pain is viral
[4323.48 - 4327.76] infection sometimes acute although most
[4325.96 - 4329.92] long-term infections of a virus or
[4327.76 - 4332.60] viruses sitting in the liver feeding on
[4329.92 - 4332.60] its favorite
[4333.64 - 4339.44] foods eggs are its favorite
[4336.24 - 4342.28] food yep
[4339.44 - 4344.52] eggs years down the road you guys all
[4342.28 - 4347.56] you're going to hear about how how eggs
[4344.52 - 4347.56] cause viral
[4347.72 - 4351.56] problems mm info it's all you're going
[4350.36 - 4354.84] to hear down the
[4351.56 - 4357.16] road I mean it could be 3 years from now
[4354.84 - 4359.20] four years from now maybe a little
[4357.16 - 4361.52] further down the road but it's all
[4359.20 - 4363.84] you're going to hear everybody's going
[4361.52 - 4365.76] to be running from eggs everybody's
[4363.84 - 4367.36] going to be talking about you know don't
[4365.76 - 4369.20] don't eat eggs everybody's going to try
[4367.36 - 4370.60] to do shock and all like influencers are
[4369.20 - 4373.08] going to be like you should stay away
[4370.60 - 4374.88] from eggs science now says eggs are bad

[4381.40 - 4385.32] like every day down the
[4382.44 - 4389.36] [Music]
[4385.32 - 4392.24] road meanwhile I've been crucified for
[4389.36 - 4394.52] it nailed to the
[4392.24 - 4397.20] cross the real cause of this chronic
[4394.52 - 4401.00] fatigue and chronic pain and all that
[4397.20 - 4404.28] muscle pain and aches acute pain that's
[4401.00 - 4407.44] not from banging into a wall or the
[4404.28 - 4411.04] corner of a door jam and you bang into
[4407.44 - 4413.16] it is viral infections ly says it just
[4411.04 - 4416.16] took my accelery force it helps me get
[4413.16 - 4419.20] sharp and on my aame at
[4416.16 - 4423.28] work is it 8 minutes 12 minutes 10
[4419.20 - 4423.28] minutes when does it kick in for
[4424.00 - 4430.72] you okay viruses sit in the
[4427.76 - 4433.32] liver they actually released
[4430.72 - 4435.40] neurotoxins viruses also spread through
[4433.32 - 4437.04] throughout the body they get into areas
[4435.40 - 4439.20] on
[4437.04 - 4441.68] nerves and so let's do a little thing on
[4439.20 - 4441.68] that really
[4442.40 - 4448.12] quick all right give me a quick second
[4449.92 - 4456.08] here
[4451.60 - 4459.32] okay so got a Vegas nerves some Vegas
[4456.08 - 4459.32] nerves here coming out of the brain
[4462.28 - 4465.28] stem
[4468.16 - 4474.84] got a little bit of a Vegas nerve here
[4471.44 - 4479.56] okay viruses feed off of foods like
[4474.84 - 4483.32] eggs that's what they do all
[4479.56 - 4486.56] right wherever that bug went I will grab
[4483.32 - 4490.36] it right here feeds off of eggs when we
[4486.56 - 4493.88] eat eggs so we eat them they go into our
[4490.36 - 4497.56] body they become fuel the undeveloped
[4493.88 - 4501.32] proteins feed bugs viruses specifically
[4497.56 - 4505.52] they love them bacteria too okay
[4501.32 - 4510.04] so when the virus releases the
[4505.52 - 4514.56] egg in a neurotoxin base okay virus
[4510.04 - 4518.92] releases an egg in a neurotoxin base the
[4514.56 - 4518.92] neurotoxins so let's make a little virus
[4519.88 - 4523.80] here so we got a virus in the body right
[4522.60 - 4527.04] there
[4523.80 - 4530.60] another virus in the body Epstein bar
[4527.04 - 4533.16] Epstein bar is a big one for muscles and
[4530.60 - 4535.40] Joints epine bar
[4533.16 - 4538.12] baby
[4535.40 - 4540.76] yep all these Epstein bar
[4538.12 - 4542.76] viruses it's a lot of different epor
[4540.76 - 4545.04] viruses people collect a lot of them now
[4542.76 - 4549.96] they don't realize
[4545.04 - 4552.16] it all right so when those viruses eat
[4549.96 - 4552.16] the
[4552.20 - 4559.24] egg because you ate the
[4556.52 - 4563.32] egg a poison comes
[4559.24 - 4566.00] out of the virus that poison see it come
[4563.32 - 4568.32] out of the viruses here that
[4566.00 - 4572.84] poison is
[4568.32 - 4575.96] in highly allergenic poison that hits
[4572.84 - 4581.00] the Vagas nerve when it hits the Vagas
[4575.96 - 4584.88] nerve different areas we can feel pain
[4581.00 - 4588.48] in the strangest places
[4584.88 - 4591.72] now if it hits the frenic
[4588.48 - 4593.92] nerves some frenic nerves in our body
[4591.72 - 4597.72] right in the Fric nerves frenic nerves
[4593.92 - 4600.96] right here okay
[4597.72 - 4604.24] right hits those frenic nerves right
[4600.96 - 4607.76] here we can have pain anywhere
[4604.24 - 4610.60] shoulders crazy
[4607.76 - 4613.60] places we can have pain
[4610.60 - 4615.40] everywhere tibial nerve do a little
[4613.60 - 4618.60] tibial nerve down
[4615.40 - 4622.68] here that's
[4618.60 - 4626.96] right we can have pain in the craziest
[4622.68 - 4629.60] places right the virus feeds on the food
[4626.96 - 4630.84] it likes this little egg right here
[4629.60 - 4633.56] releases
[4630.84 - 4636.68] neurotoxins they hit nerves all through
[4633.56 - 4639.56] the body nerves that go to joints and so
[4636.68 - 4642.00] forth connected tissue around the joints
[4639.56 - 4643.92] and now we're in pain mysteriously in
[4642.00 - 4646.20] pain
[4643.92 - 4649.12] regardless of your diagnosis ongoing
[4646.20 - 4652.32] joint and muscle pain is viral that's a
[4649.12 - 4655.56] strong bold statement from Spirit of
[4652.32 - 4657.56] compassion these are not my words in the
[4655.56 - 4661.60] books
[4657.56 - 4664.76] okay s so's words in the
[4661.60 - 4666.68] book and if someone doesn't like that
[4664.76 - 4669.68] well 10 years down the road when all
[4666.68 - 4672.00] their bioh hacks didn't work for them
[4669.68 - 4673.84] and they were and their scale finally
[4672.00 - 4674.72] tipped
[4673.84 - 4677.52] and
[4674.72 - 4680.36] they're having real problems with their
[4677.52 - 4682.32] health and no influencer can kind of
