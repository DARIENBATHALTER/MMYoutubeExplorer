[902.40 - 905.68] everybody's eating fat that's what
[904.72 - 908.80] everybody's doing
[905.68 - 910.48] okay and then if that's not bad all on
[908.80 - 912.00] its own because everybody's just tanking
[910.48 - 914.88] the fat tank and the fat every day
[912.00 - 917.20] it's it's part of everybody's diet every
[914.88 - 919.36] single day sometimes all day long right
[917.20 - 921.68] it's good to take a fat break out of
[919.36 - 924.00] your diet so you don't kill your liver
[921.68 - 926.16] kill your gallbladder so you don't you
[924.00 - 929.28] you don't kill your kidneys
[926.16 - 930.80] the fats hurt the kidneys over time the
[929.28 - 931.84] people end up getting kidney disease
[930.80 - 935.20] later on because
[931.84 - 938.80] the fats help to actually speed that up
[935.20 - 940.72] help to promote that that condition and
[938.80 - 942.48] all that plaque that fat plaque that
[940.72 - 946.40] gets in the arteries of the heart
[942.48 - 949.44] gets into the valves um that's from
[946.40 - 951.76] a lifetime of eating fat so i like what
[949.44 - 954.64] i like to do is i like to
[951.76 - 955.76] make dishes that don't have the fats in
[954.64 - 960.16] hopes that you guys
[955.76 - 961.04] eat one dish a day or one smoothie a day
[960.16 - 962.40] or
[961.04 - 964.64] you know where you're not getting all
[962.40 - 965.28] that fat in your in your in your meals
[964.64 - 966.96] right
[965.28 - 968.32] the whole reason why intermittent
[966.96 - 969.76] fasting even though it's not a great
[968.32 - 970.24] idea because it's not done right out
[969.76 - 971.84] there
[970.24 - 973.28] the whole reason it's even helping
[971.84 - 975.28] people to some degree because they're
[973.28 - 977.12] removing the fats in the morning
[975.28 - 978.64] they're getting they're getting rid of
[977.12 - 980.32] all that fat they're getting rid of the
[978.64 - 982.24] peanut butter they're getting rid of the
[980.32 - 984.16] eggs they're getting rid of the bacon
[982.24 - 985.76] whatever it is they did in the morning
[984.16 - 988.56] they're getting rid of
[985.76 - 988.88] and that's why they start to get better
[988.56 - 991.36] or
[988.88 - 991.92] lose a little bit of weight because they
[991.36 - 993.76] stopped
[991.92 - 996.00] bombarding their liver they don't know
[993.76 - 997.76] that's why nobody knows why
[996.00 - 999.76] intermittent fasting so-called experts
[997.76 - 1002.16] don't know that's why
[999.76 - 1003.92] because the fat is missing and if they
[1002.16 - 1005.44] do know now it's because of the medical
[1003.92 - 1008.40] medium information
[1005.44 - 1010.08] but i'm trying to get the radical fats
[1008.40 - 1011.12] out of your diet a little bit here and

[1168.80 - 1173.84] i'm trying to keep you guys off the
[1171.60 - 1176.64] radical fats a little bit because the
[1173.84 - 1178.56] health gurus of today will literally
[1176.64 - 1179.84] cause you guys to have heart problems
[1178.56 - 1182.00] down the road
[1179.84 - 1183.52] they'll tell you healthy fat healthy fat
[1182.00 - 1184.08] healthy fat and guess where healthy fat
[1183.52 - 1187.04] ends up
[1184.08 - 1188.88] in your arteries and your veins all fat
[1187.04 - 1189.76] ends up in your arteries and your veins
[1188.88 - 1191.36] down the road
[1189.76 - 1192.80] you end up getting the stints you end up
[1191.36 - 1193.52] getting the blood clots you end up
[1192.80 - 1195.28] getting
[1193.52 - 1197.92] the blood vessels you end up getting the
[1195.28 - 1200.80] aneurysms you end up getting it all
[1197.92 - 1202.24] the embolisms aneurysms blood clots you
[1200.80 - 1202.96] got to get the stint you got to get the
[1202.24 - 1206.24] shunts
[1202.96 - 1207.44] all that stuff and and the thing is the
[1206.24 - 1210.56] problem is with fat
[1207.44 - 1212.16] is fat's so addictive it's addictive
[1210.56 - 1214.00] because it triggers the adrenaline
[1212.16 - 1215.52] right you eat that avocado and i don't
[1214.00 - 1217.12] mind if you guys eat avocado i don't
[1215.52 - 1217.68] mind if you guys eat some healthy fats
[1217.12 - 1219.36] and
[1217.68 - 1221.60] if you guys like animal protein and you
[1219.36 - 1222.00] want like you know salmon or anything
[1221.60 - 1224.48] but
[1222.00 - 1225.36] what it is is there's so much of it and
[1224.48 - 1227.68] there's so
[1225.36 - 1229.04] too much of it in the diet and then all
[1227.68 - 1231.04] the health gurus are like
[1229.04 - 1232.40] you know more fat fats good for you you
[1231.04 - 1234.32] need fat for your brain
[1232.40 - 1235.76] and they don't realize it but the more
[1234.32 - 1238.08] fat you eat
[1235.76 - 1239.68] your brain atrophies down the road so
[1238.08 - 1241.52] you end up getting your brain start to
[1239.68 - 1243.36] shrink and shrink and shrink
[1241.52 - 1244.72] this is cooking actually really good and
[1243.36 - 1247.44] really quick
[1244.72 - 1249.84] um so this is going really good right
[1247.44 - 1249.84] now
[1250.08 - 1254.64] it's still it's it's it's going nice and
[1252.88 - 1256.80] good i'm gonna pop a lid on here for for
[1254.64 - 1260.96] a second
[1256.80 - 1262.08] so um the whole point is that fat builds
[1260.96 - 1264.08] up with plaque
[1262.08 - 1265.84] sits on the inside of the heart sits on
[1264.08 - 1268.24] the inside of the arteries
[1265.84 - 1269.92] sits on the inside of blood vessels so
[1268.24 - 1272.16] as we're doing the fats and we don't
[1269.92 - 1274.64] stop and it's every single day
[1272.16 - 1276.80] and it's not just that if you did all
[1274.64 - 1279.68] that bacon in the past
[1276.80 - 1281.68] it's it's it built up a fine layer
[1279.68 - 1285.12] inside the arteries and veins
[1281.68 - 1287.36] you can't get that out unless you go low
[1285.12 - 1289.12] fat unless you drop the radical fats
[1287.36 - 1290.00] once in a while unless you start to have
[1289.12 - 1292.80] a meal
[1290.00 - 1294.72] that's fat free once in a while doreen
[1292.80 - 1297.20] says i feel so much better fat free for
[1294.72 - 1300.00] a few months lost 40 pounds
[1297.20 - 1301.36] that i needed off during right isn't

[1303.92 - 1308.16] that's amazing like 40 pounds
[1306.56 - 1310.00] and what people don't realize is they
[1308.16 - 1311.60] all have a layer of fat inside their
[1310.00 - 1313.76] veins and arteries
[1311.60 - 1314.80] they all do it's from the bacon the eggs
[1313.76 - 1316.48] the milk cheese
[1314.80 - 1318.00] the butter in your coffee whatever it is
[1316.48 - 1320.48] it's just all from the fats

[1438.08 - 1441.84] my little heart in here
[1439.60 - 1443.28] on here and um here's what happens when
[1441.84 - 1444.72] you keep on eating all that fat
[1443.28 - 1446.72] i'm not saying you guys like i said
[1444.72 - 1447.52] can't have some tahini and can't have
[1446.72 - 1450.72] some
[1447.52 - 1451.20] uh hemp seeds all right sesame seeds
[1450.72 - 1453.52] right
[1451.20 - 1456.32] okay can't have some sunflower seeds
[1453.52 - 1460.32] can't do some pumpkin seeds you know
[1456.32 - 1461.20] um i'm not saying that you can't have
[1460.32 - 1463.68] all that
[1461.20 - 1464.40] or have your favorite animal protein
[1463.68 - 1466.56] right
[1464.40 - 1467.60] but what i'm saying is that's why
[1466.56 - 1470.80] everybody's brains
[1467.60 - 1473.52] atrophy everybody's brain's atrophy
[1470.80 - 1474.08] because the fat stops the brain from
[1473.52 - 1477.60] getting
[1474.08 - 1479.68] fed glycogen glucose
[1477.60 - 1480.80] the fats stop the glucose from getting
[1479.68 - 1483.36] into the brain
[1480.80 - 1485.12] the brain atrophies year after year now
[1483.36 - 1486.72] you're 40 years old brain shrinks a
[1485.12 - 1488.72] little bit now you're 50 years old
[1486.72 - 1490.40] the brain shrinks a little bit brain
[1488.72 - 1492.56] brain brain shrinks ring shrinks that's
[1490.40 - 1494.08] what happens
[1492.56 - 1496.00] and then the heart at the same time
[1494.08 - 1497.68] fills up with all that lining all that
[1496.00 - 1501.12] fat all your blood vessels your veins
[1497.68 - 1502.96] your arteries and guess what everybody
[1501.12 - 1504.88] who's been telling you to do as much
[1502.96 - 1507.20] fat because you need it you need those
[1504.88 - 1509.76] fats make sure you're on all those fats
[1507.20 - 1511.36] they don't pay the price meaning they
[1509.76 - 1513.68] don't care about you
[1511.36 - 1514.72] 20 years from now after they gave you
[1513.68 - 1518.08] all that bad
[1514.72 - 1521.44] information all that misinformation
[1518.08 - 1522.96] who cares hey gurus health coaches
[1521.44 - 1524.88] trainers whoever they are you know
[1522.96 - 1526.24] doctors podcast doctors
[1524.88 - 1528.48] let them keep on giving you
[1526.24 - 1531.36] misinformation over and over again
[1528.48 - 1532.80] and then in the end who cares you guys
[1531.36 - 1535.36] end up
[1532.80 - 1536.16] you end up with problems it's not their
[1535.36 - 1538.80] problem
[1536.16 - 1541.20] it's your problem it's no one's problem
[1538.80 - 1543.20] but yours
[1541.20 - 1545.28] that i actually care i don't want you to
[1543.20 - 1547.52] be in a position down the road
[1545.28 - 1549.60] where we could have probably got got
[1547.52 - 1553.04] some you know
[1549.60 - 1554.84] fix-its going so you can avoid all that
[1553.04 - 1557.12] i'm doing some red bell pepper in this
[1554.84 - 1559.04] now
[1557.12 - 1560.96] i do the red bell pepper a little bit
[1559.04 - 1563.52] later
[1560.96 - 1565.12] tends to cook quicker i also like my red
[1563.52 - 1568.16] bell pepper
[1565.12 - 1571.20] a certain way not so
[1568.16 - 1575.92] soft putting my red bell pepper in here
[1571.20 - 1579.20] this is the loaded potato hash
[1575.92 - 1579.20] i got right here i'm going to cut this
[1582.84 - 1589.20] circle working on a new podcast
[1586.40 - 1591.20] episode couple of new podcast episodes
[1589.20 - 1592.96] medical meme podcast at apple podcast
[1591.20 - 1595.44] check it out catch up on the other 17
[1592.96 - 1596.88] new episodes too
[1595.44 - 1599.12] so i'm about to read something out of
[1596.88 - 1601.92] book right now i'm going to talk about
[1599.12 - 1601.92] lyme disease
[1602.40 - 1607.44] truth about lyme disease gina since
[1605.12 - 1610.80] starting mm two and a half years ago
[1607.44 - 1611.68] i've been able to get get off of anxiety
[1610.80 - 1614.64] medication
[1611.68 - 1618.08] caffeine and i've lost 30 pounds so
[1614.64 - 1620.96] grateful to you aw and soc
[1618.08 - 1623.92] just so you know that's that healing
[1620.96 - 1627.28] story right you just told me
[1623.92 - 1630.48] would be heralded as god in the media
[1627.28 - 1632.88] if i if it was if it was like
[1630.48 - 1634.56] things that were happening out there in
[1632.88 - 1636.72] in medicine
[1634.56 - 1638.00] like if that was happening in regular
[1636.72 - 1642.08] medicine
[1638.00 - 1645.44] a functional medicine doctor you know
[1642.08 - 1648.56] has one of those in a year one
[1645.44 - 1650.64] patient in a year
[1648.56 - 1655.28] he treat it like god he's treated like
[1650.64 - 1656.88] god or she's treated like god
[1655.28 - 1658.72] medical mean information has helped
[1656.88 - 1669.84] millions get to that point
[1658.72 - 1669.84] over all these years um
[1671.60 - 1676.08] sarah says how old am i i'm old
[1676.24 - 1681.44] i'm older older than people know
[1679.28 - 1683.12] i've been doing this for over 30 plus
[1681.44 - 1685.84] years
[1683.12 - 1688.72] um just re up until recently everybody
[1685.84 - 1692.80] thought i was 28 years old and
[1688.72 - 1694.56] that's kind of funny i don't look 28.
[1692.80 - 1695.68] anyway look i got the lime disease
[1694.56 - 1696.00] chapter right here i want to read a
[1695.68 - 1699.60] quote
[1696.00 - 1699.60] for you in the moment
[1707.36 - 1711.84] so much information to cover
[1712.88 - 1717.12] it really is there's just so much good
[1714.48 - 1719.44] information to cover so
[1717.12 - 1720.64] thanks to the readers who went into
[1719.44 - 1723.68] action
[1720.64 - 1724.32] with the information here this book has
[1723.68 - 1726.20] prompted
[1724.32 - 1727.36] medical research and science to
[1726.20 - 1730.64] re-categorize
[1727.36 - 1734.24] lyme disease while labeling lyme
[1730.64 - 1736.88] as autoimmune still does not represent a
[1734.24 - 1739.92] full understanding of lyme symptoms
[1736.88 - 1741.76] this re-categorization is a way
[1739.92 - 1743.36] for medical research and science to
[1741.76 - 1745.60] admit we don't
[1743.36 - 1746.88] understand this as well as we thought we
[1745.60 - 1748.80] did
[1746.88 - 1750.32] and that's a major shift towards
[1748.80 - 1753.12] progress
[1750.32 - 1755.68] it's testament to the people who read
[1753.12 - 1756.00] here in medical medium that lyme disease
[1755.68 - 1759.36] is
[1756.00 - 1761.36] viral not bacterial who brought that
[1759.36 - 1763.52] information to their doctors and who
[1761.36 - 1764.88] applied the healing protocols here and
[1763.52 - 1766.88] got results
[1764.88 - 1769.44] it's also thanks to the doctors who have
[1766.88 - 1772.24] educated themselves with this material
[1769.44 - 1773.20] as they work to help patients many
[1772.24 - 1775.36] doctors
[1773.20 - 1776.72] have even applied the healing protocols
[1775.36 - 1780.08] in their own lives
[1776.72 - 1781.84] so i'm talking about lyme disease and
[1780.08 - 1783.20] if you're someone who doesn't have lyme
[1781.84 - 1784.56] disease you weren't diagnosed with lyme
[1783.20 - 1785.84] disease you might want to hang around
[1784.56 - 1788.48] for this
[1785.84 - 1790.08] um because it applies to so many
[1788.48 - 1792.96] different conditions okay
[1790.08 - 1793.36] that's fatigue that's fibromyalgia
[1792.96 - 1796.48] that's
[1793.36 - 1798.24] ms because in the end they all can get a
[1796.48 - 1799.36] lyme diagnosis tomorrow if you go to a
[1798.24 - 1802.24] lyme doctor
[1799.36 - 1803.84] if you got cfs if you got lupus just go
[1802.24 - 1805.68] to a lyme doctor you'll get a lime that
[1803.84 - 1807.28] you'll get a lyme disease diagnosis
[1805.68 - 1809.36] and if you don't get one from that lyme
[1807.28 - 1810.24] doctor go to another lyme doctor you'll
[1809.36 - 1813.60] get one
[1810.24 - 1816.40] you will get a lyme diagnosis if you go
[1813.60 - 1818.08] lyme disease doctor shopping so it
[1816.40 - 1820.40] applies to all you guys
[1818.08 - 1821.68] that includes hashimoto's thyroid
[1820.40 - 1822.64] problems that includes lupus that
[1821.68 - 1824.24] includes ra
[1822.64 - 1825.84] it includes just symptoms like tingles
[1824.24 - 1826.56] and numbness aches and pains tightness
[1825.84 - 1829.36] in the chest
[1826.56 - 1830.80] even anxiety you go to a lyme doctor
[1829.36 - 1831.92] you're gonna walk out of there with a
[1830.80 - 1833.60] stamp on your back
[1831.92 - 1835.20] boom that's gonna be the stamp on your
[1833.60 - 1836.16] back saying lyme disease that's what
[1835.20 - 1839.84] it's going to say
[1836.16 - 1843.04] right when you walk out of there um
[1839.84 - 1844.80] that's how it works this
[1843.04 - 1847.60] this potato hash is cooking up really
[1844.80 - 1847.60] nice right now
[1848.88 - 1855.20] hey uh sigrid um the tick tock green
[1852.32 - 1855.84] shirt video was so funny i laughed and
[1855.20 - 1856.94] could not
[1855.84 - 1860.30] sleep
[1856.94 - 1860.30] [Laughter]
[1860.64 - 1864.48] that tick-tock video with with the rat
[1863.68 - 1866.96] running
[1864.48 - 1869.04] up over the uh counter and the roaches
[1866.96 - 1871.60] running over the counter
[1869.04 - 1872.16] there's no editing on that that's one
[1871.60 - 1875.52] straight
[1872.16 - 1879.04] minute of me pulling that off it's
[1875.52 - 1882.16] actually really funny
[1879.04 - 1882.16] cooking this up right now
[1885.92 - 1890.72] it's going to lyme disease
[1889.12 - 1892.40] so if you've got a condition and you've
[1890.72 - 1894.80] got symptoms whether it's ticks and
[1892.40 - 1898.00] spasms whether it's leg cramps whether
[1894.80 - 1901.28] it's restless leg syndrome whether it's
[1898.00 - 1904.64] burning skin whether you've got
[1901.28 - 1905.84] uh thrush whatever it is if you go to a
[1904.64 - 1908.24] lyme doctor
[1905.84 - 1910.40] lyme specialist you'll end up with that
[1908.24 - 1911.92] lime stamp
[1910.40 - 1913.60] that's just what's going to happen
[1911.92 - 1914.48] you're not going to go to a lyme disease
[1913.60 - 1919.68] doctor
[1914.48 - 1922.48] and leave there without a lyme diagnosis
[1919.68 - 1924.32] if you do go to another and you'll leave
[1922.48 - 1926.88] there with the lyme diagnosis
[1924.32 - 1929.44] because so really what happens is that
[1926.88 - 1932.40] neurological lyme
[1929.44 - 1934.24] is basically neurological everything
[1932.40 - 1937.68] caused by epstein-barr virus
[1934.24 - 1941.20] okay and shingles sometimes hhv-6
[1937.68 - 1943.28] simplex 1 2 as well the cold sore virus
[1941.20 - 1945.92] all right and sedimental virus can cause
[1943.28 - 1949.84] some trouble too these are viruses
[1945.92 - 1950.56] that release neurotoxin the epstein-barr
[1949.84 - 1954.72] virus
[1950.56 - 1957.52] releases a neurotoxin that neurotoxin
[1954.72 - 1960.48] is what creates neurological symptoms
[1957.52 - 1963.12] tingles and numbness aches and pains
[1960.48 - 1964.00] burning skin pain in the jaw pain
[1963.12 - 1968.80] everywhere
[1964.00 - 1968.80] okay neck pain back pain migraines
[1968.88 - 1977.36] neurotoxins just so you know
[1972.24 - 1981.68] and neurotoxins don't come from bacteria
[1977.36 - 1985.60] they don't come from bacteria bacteria
[1981.68 - 1989.56] bartonella the hybrid but vibesia
[1985.60 - 1993.12] borrelia they don't release
[1989.56 - 1994.72] neurotoxins you can't get neurological
[1993.12 - 1997.20] symptoms from those
[1994.72 - 1998.64] you can't but yet you have any
[1997.20 - 2000.16] neurological symptoms
[1998.64 - 2002.16] all you have to do is go to lyme doctor
[2000.16 - 2004.16] they'll stamp you with a lyme diagnosis
[2002.16 - 2005.92] out the door it's like the broom
[2004.16 - 2007.60] salesman it's gonna
[2005.92 - 2008.96] doesn't matter what size broom it is
[2007.60 - 2010.32] you're just gonna get a broom as you're
[2008.96 - 2013.12] leaving that store
[2010.32 - 2013.52] right babisia bartonella borrelia are
[2013.12 - 2016.80] not
[2013.52 - 2020.16] super bugs they are not
[2016.80 - 2023.28] super bugs news flash
[2020.16 - 2026.64] they are not super bugs okay
[2023.28 - 2032.08] they can get killed off really easily
[2026.64 - 2034.48] with one dose of a mild antibiotic
[2032.08 - 2037.28] they don't even cause neurological lyme
[2034.48 - 2040.88] they don't cause neurological problems
[2037.28 - 2043.76] they're harmless bacteria
[2040.88 - 2044.96] and a harmless parasitical hybrid of
[2043.76 - 2047.04] bacteria
[2044.96 - 2048.96] as far as babisia goes it's really
[2047.04 - 2052.24] bacteria
[2048.96 - 2054.88] and um mrsa
[2052.24 - 2056.56] mercy is a superbug so mersa is a
[2054.88 - 2056.88] superbug i'm in lyme disease if you just
[2056.56 - 2058.64] get
[2056.88 - 2061.68] got on here it's a new edition medical
[2058.64 - 2065.04] medium merce is a superbug right
[2061.68 - 2068.32] a superbug it's one of the superbugs
[2065.04 - 2071.60] antibiotic resistant and
[2068.32 - 2073.60] they need less antibiotics and not even
[2071.60 - 2075.68] the harshest antibiotics
[2073.60 - 2076.96] and the success rate for mrsa is
[2075.68 - 2079.52] unbelievable
[2076.96 - 2080.24] it's incredible really a success rate
[2079.52 - 2082.96] right
[2080.24 - 2083.44] but for some reason you got neurological
[2082.96 - 2085.28] lyme
[2083.44 - 2087.20] so-called borrelia and bartonella and
[2085.28 - 2089.84] babisia and you're sick for
[2087.20 - 2092.08] years they can bombard you with the most
[2089.84 - 2094.24] aggressive antibiotics
[2092.08 - 2095.68] and you just get sicker and sicker and
[2094.24 - 2098.48] sicker
[2095.68 - 2100.12] and then would it what happens there
[2098.48 - 2103.60] will you get the
[2100.12 - 2105.12] neurotoxin shock you know and
[2103.60 - 2106.96] people think it's herxheimer so you're
[2105.12 - 2108.80] getting bombarded with heavy heavy
[2106.96 - 2111.36] antibiotics
[2108.80 - 2113.20] and and you're getting a reaction from
[2111.36 - 2115.52] these heavy antibiotics you're not
[2113.20 - 2117.20] getting a reaction from die off
[2115.52 - 2119.36] and that's a confusion with lyme disease
[2117.20 - 2122.80] right there so it's not that you
[2119.36 - 2125.12] get die off
[2122.80 - 2126.08] you know from the antibiotics you get
[2125.12 - 2129.20] agitated
[2126.08 - 2131.04] nerves from the antibiotics the nervous
[2129.20 - 2133.12] system because it's so hypersensitive
[2131.04 - 2137.12] from all those neurotoxins
[2133.12 - 2138.88] can't handle all that harsh antibiotic
[2137.12 - 2140.48] so now you're getting sicker you're
[2138.88 - 2142.08] getting more neurological symptoms and
[2140.48 - 2142.72] your lyme doctors like and this is what
[2142.08 - 2144.32] happened for
[2142.72 - 2146.48] years your lime doctor's like that's
[2144.32 - 2148.48] herxheimer that's herxheimer keep up the
[2146.48 - 2150.16] antibiotics that's herxheimer or we'll
[2148.48 - 2151.44] back down the antibiotics so that you
[2150.16 - 2152.64] can get a little bit better from your
[2151.44 - 2154.16] herxheimer and then we'll bring the
[2152.64 - 2155.44] antibiotics back in bringing the
[2154.16 - 2157.44] antibiotics back in
[2155.44 - 2160.32] it's misinformation it's actually the
[2157.44 - 2160.32] wrong direction
[2160.96 - 2166.48] so yeah i'm just cooking up this right
[2164.24 - 2166.48] now
[2170.16 - 2173.12] but of course if your doctor wants you
[2171.44 - 2174.16] to do antibiotics you do antibiotics i
[2173.12 - 2175.60] mean if that's
[2174.16 - 2177.28] you know if you're happy with your
[2175.60 - 2178.80] doctor you listen to your doctor you do
[2177.28 - 2180.08] and i'm just talking about experience
[2178.80 - 2182.88] from
[2180.08 - 2187.84] from thousands and thousands of cases
[2182.88 - 2187.84] over the years
[2188.48 - 2195.84] now this book teaches how it's not
[2192.56 - 2197.60] bacterial for lyme disease this book
[2195.84 - 2199.68] teaches how it's viral
[2197.60 - 2200.80] and that's what the real cause of lyme
[2199.68 - 2202.80] disease is
[2200.80 - 2204.08] so i'm giving you the rundown on the
[2202.80 - 2205.76] bacterial aspect
[2204.08 - 2207.36] so what happens is viruses such as
[2205.76 - 2208.32] epstein-barr like i was talking about
[2207.36 - 2210.96] before
[2208.32 - 2212.32] cytomegalovirus simplex 1 and shingles
[2210.96 - 2213.92] and hhv6
[2212.32 - 2217.32] the viruses that i was speaking about
[2213.92 - 2220.40] earlier those viruses create neurotoxins
[2217.32 - 2222.88] neurotoxins inflame the nerves
[2220.40 - 2224.24] when they inflame the nerves you get the
[2222.88 - 2226.08] neurological symptoms
[2224.24 - 2228.08] the tingles and numbness the aches and
[2226.08 - 2231.84] pains the body pain the neck pain
[2228.08 - 2233.44] the jaw pain ticks and spasms
[2231.84 - 2235.12] and these are just some things right
[2233.44 - 2237.44] there so
[2235.12 - 2238.96] you you end up getting all those
[2237.44 - 2240.08] different neurological symptoms from
[2238.96 - 2243.60] neurotoxins
[2240.08 - 2245.28] from viruses right so anyway you guys
[2243.60 - 2246.32] this is cut this is coming along right
[2245.28 - 2248.48] here
[2246.32 - 2250.80] bacteria doesn't release neurotoxins as
[2248.48 - 2252.96] i was saying before
[2250.80 - 2255.20] bacteria can't release a neurotoxin it
[2252.96 - 2257.84] doesn't produce a neurotoxin so bacteria
[2255.20 - 2259.92] doesn't cause neurological symptoms
[2257.84 - 2262.24] unless it's a bacterial infection that
[2259.92 - 2264.00] causes a really extremely high fever and
[2262.24 - 2264.80] then you can have temporary neurological
[2264.00 - 2266.56] symptoms
[2264.80 - 2268.24] but that's because of a really really
[2266.56 - 2269.20] high fever but that's a whole different
[2268.24 - 2270.72] story
[2269.20 - 2273.04] talked about that over the years this is
[2270.72 - 2274.88] an entirely different issue altogether
[2273.04 - 2275.59] so i'm going to add some spices to this
[2274.88 - 2278.62] right here
[2275.59 - 2278.62] [Music]
[2279.36 - 2284.00] put a little red bell pepper not red
[2281.28 - 2286.64] bell hot chili flakes right here
[2284.00 - 2288.16] dr faun md do people believe that only
[2286.64 - 2290.08] doctors can heal others
[2288.16 - 2292.00] i have thousands of patients who weren't
[2290.08 - 2293.44] cured or healed by doctors and
[2292.00 - 2295.20] specialists
[2293.44 - 2296.64] i mean it's interesting you know i mean
[2295.20 - 2299.68] there's i think
[2296.64 - 2302.16] people need to be sick long enough
[2299.68 - 2303.28] seen enough doctors to realize whoa wait
[2302.16 - 2305.12] a minute we don't have enough
[2303.28 - 2306.96] information out there i just put
[2305.12 - 2308.16] red hot chili flakes in there we don't
[2306.96 - 2310.00] have enough information
[2308.16 - 2311.76] out there i'm putting a little garlic
[2310.00 - 2312.56] powder in here you can do fresh garlic
[2311.76 - 2316.56] i'm putting
[2312.56 - 2319.60] a little bit of garlic powder in here
[2316.56 - 2326.64] i'm putting a little thyme in here okay
[2319.60 - 2328.40] doing that little time
[2326.64 - 2330.56] so we're still talking about lyme but
[2328.40 - 2333.68] listen it pertains to everything
[2330.56 - 2336.48] pertains to everything neurotoxins
[2333.68 - 2340.32] caused by viruses such as epstein-barr
[2336.48 - 2341.84] giving people a whole range of symptoms
[2340.32 - 2343.60] and conditions vertigo
[2341.84 - 2345.28] dizziness feeling of like being on the
[2343.60 - 2347.36] boat on a boat
[2345.28 - 2349.52] anxiety your chest feels like it's
[2347.36 - 2351.52] tightened up you can't even breathe
[2349.52 - 2352.88] um you're going to the er constantly
[2351.52 - 2354.96] because you think you're having a heart
[2352.88 - 2357.04] attack
[2354.96 - 2358.32] i mean it pertains to so many different
[2357.04 - 2361.36] conditions
[2358.32 - 2363.52] insomnia other conditions like that so
[2361.36 - 2365.20] you guys um
[2363.52 - 2367.12] this is coming together really nice
[2365.20 - 2369.84] about to put some fresh cilantro on top
[2367.12 - 2369.84] of it in a little bit
[2372.96 - 2376.00] i don't know if you can see that in
[2374.32 - 2377.28] there
[2376.00 - 2383.84] i'm just going to give you a little flip
[2377.28 - 2383.84] to look can you guys see
[2386.40 - 2396.96] so when it comes down to lyme disease
[2391.60 - 2401.04] hundreds of thousands of mostly women
[2396.96 - 2403.52] were injured from the mistakes made
[2401.04 - 2404.56] with lyme disease their bodies were
[2403.52 - 2407.60] bombarded with
[2404.56 - 2410.56] intense amounts of antibiotics some of
[2407.60 - 2412.72] the harshest antibiotics
[2410.56 - 2414.40] it led to them becoming sicker and
[2412.72 - 2418.48] sicker and sicker
[2414.40 - 2421.20] it led to doctor shopping forever
[2418.48 - 2422.16] and it it really really hurt a lot of
[2421.20 - 2423.76] people
[2422.16 - 2425.52] tens of thousands lost their lives
[2423.76 - 2429.76] throughout the process
[2425.52 - 2431.20] um sandy was watering used to cook this
[2429.76 - 2432.48] instead a little bit of water right off
[2431.20 - 2436.16] the running
[2432.48 - 2437.44] so i've been seeing so you guys you know
[2436.16 - 2438.00] one of the things that have helped so
[2437.44 - 2439.84] many people
[2438.00 - 2441.36] heal is the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2439.84 - 2442.72] the medical medium heavy metal detox
[2441.36 - 2447.04] movie
[2442.72 - 2447.04] and then um
[2447.28 - 2451.52] and then you know what happens is a lot
[2448.80 - 2453.68] of people look doctors weren't trying to
[2451.52 - 2454.88] hurt people it was just because
[2453.68 - 2456.32] you had to remember that with lyme
[2454.88 - 2457.76] disease doctors were never trying to
[2456.32 - 2460.24] hurt people that's not it at all
[2457.76 - 2462.16] doctors are always compassionate their
[2460.24 - 2464.48] hearts in it they want to heal people
[2462.16 - 2466.24] and you know and that's important to
[2464.48 - 2466.64] understand it's just that mistakes are
[2466.24 - 2467.92] made
[2466.64 - 2470.24] in the industries in the medical
[2467.92 - 2471.44] industry and misinformation has
[2470.24 - 2473.12] definitely sent people the wrong
[2471.44 - 2476.40] direction for healing it's made things
[2473.12 - 2478.56] very difficult over the years
[2476.40 - 2480.08] heavy metal detox smoothie saved my life
[2478.56 - 2482.48] christy amazing
[2480.08 - 2484.40] look out look out for that zeolite stuff
[2482.48 - 2486.32] that's going around don't i i don't
[2484.40 - 2488.88] recommend that at all
[2486.32 - 2490.40] i'm noticing what happens when here's
[2488.88 - 2491.92] the thing the medical medium community
[2490.40 - 2493.04] has healed more people
[2491.92 - 2495.04] than anywhere else in all the
[2493.04 - 2498.48] communities and so
[2495.04 - 2498.88] all these old things these old trendy
[2498.48 - 2500.64] things
[2498.88 - 2502.64] try to come back into the medical meme
[2500.64 - 2504.48] community you know like the alkaline
[2502.64 - 2506.16] ionizer water machine it tries
[2504.48 - 2507.76] tries to come back in to sell it to
[2506.16 - 2510.80] people that have already healed
[2507.76 - 2513.04] and the same thing with zeolite i don't
[2510.80 - 2514.08] recommend zeolite at all so if someone
[2513.04 - 2517.52] thinks hey
[2514.08 - 2521.36] um you know you know i used to
[2517.52 - 2525.12] i used to i used to recommend
[2521.36 - 2527.68] a very gentle zeolite a long time ago
[2525.12 - 2528.64] i don't anymore though and it was only
[2527.68 - 2530.88] because
[2528.64 - 2532.72] there wasn't a lot of dolls to be found
[2530.88 - 2533.76] there wasn't a lot of atlantic dolls to
[2532.72 - 2535.60] be found
[2533.76 - 2537.52] and that was one of the reasons why i
[2535.60 - 2541.36] did and it was really
[2537.52 - 2543.28] and it was really just to help
[2541.36 - 2545.36] try to get a little bit of metal out of
[2543.28 - 2548.40] the intestinal tract okay
[2545.36 - 2550.00] and but it still wasn't enough zeolite
[2548.40 - 2552.96] just doesn't work good it just
[2550.00 - 2555.04] doesn't work and right now there's a
[2552.96 - 2556.48] whole bunch of mlm stuff going on a
[2555.04 - 2557.92] whole bunch of pyramid scheme stuff
[2556.48 - 2559.12] going on everybody's trying to sell
[2557.92 - 2561.60] something in the medical medium
[2559.12 - 2563.20] community and what happens is
[2561.60 - 2564.80] what happens is with the medical medium
[2563.20 - 2566.32] community is because it's the only
[2564.80 - 2567.20] community where that many people are
[2566.32 - 2569.36] healing
[2567.20 - 2570.88] and they're healing like like no one's
[2569.36 - 2573.04] ever seen
[2570.88 - 2574.64] it's easy to bring things in that never
[2573.04 - 2576.72] fixed anybody from the past
[2574.64 - 2577.76] and resell them in the medical medium
[2576.72 - 2581.20] community right
[2577.76 - 2582.96] that's how it's done in 2000 like that
[2581.20 - 2585.28] in the mid 2000s
[2582.96 - 2586.96] like the alkaline alkaline ionizer water
[2585.28 - 2588.16] machines they were practically dead on
[2586.96 - 2589.84] arrival because
[2588.16 - 2592.08] for the last 30 years they never got
[2589.84 - 2594.32] anybody better and
[2592.08 - 2596.08] they were then all of a sudden rebirth
[2594.32 - 2597.12] in the medical medium community because
[2596.08 - 2599.36] when you rebirth
[2597.12 - 2601.04] something in a community that's already
[2599.36 - 2602.32] healing like no one's ever seen before
[2601.04 - 2604.56] it's easy to say oh
[2602.32 - 2606.40] you want to do medical medium which got
[2604.56 - 2608.56] you better and add this
[2606.40 - 2610.24] you want to do medical medium and add
[2608.56 - 2611.76] zeola you want to do medical medium
[2610.24 - 2613.76] heavy metal detox smoothie
[2611.76 - 2616.56] and add zeolite and i don't want to hurt
[2613.76 - 2618.00] anybody's feelings out there but like
[2616.56 - 2620.40] like somebody said in the youtube
[2618.00 - 2622.24] comments a little while ago someone said
[2620.40 - 2623.92] that i'm not a people pleaser and i
[2622.24 - 2626.32] remembered that and read that
[2623.92 - 2627.04] and i was like that's true you know i'm
[2626.32 - 2629.44] not
[2627.04 - 2630.32] it's not about people pleasing it's
[2629.44 - 2633.36] about
[2630.32 - 2636.32] life saving right that's what it's about
[2633.36 - 2637.60] and it's about making sure that you have
[2636.32 - 2639.84] what you need
[2637.60 - 2641.28] so you don't get in trouble down the
[2639.84 - 2643.12] road with your condition
[2641.28 - 2646.16] so you have every opportunity to heal so
[2643.12 - 2647.92] the heavy metal detox smoothie
[2646.16 - 2649.68] is healing people and it has a track
[2647.92 - 2652.72] record of healing people right
[2649.68 - 2654.64] so then old you know old dogs come in
[2652.72 - 2655.28] with like things that never got anybody
[2654.64 - 2657.68] better
[2655.28 - 2659.44] like zeolite zeolite never got people
[2657.68 - 2661.76] better throughout the years it just
[2659.44 - 2663.04] it's been around for a long time and it
[2661.76 - 2666.00] never got anybody
[2663.04 - 2667.60] better it doesn't have that history of
[2666.00 - 2669.36] thousands and thousands of people
[2667.60 - 2670.56] getting better it just doesn't have that
[2669.36 - 2673.04] in fact it died
[2670.56 - 2673.76] along the way you couldn't even revive
[2673.04 - 2676.56] zeolite
[2673.76 - 2678.08] now people are trying to revive zeolite
[2676.56 - 2679.28] and say well you need your heavy metal
[2678.08 - 2682.00] detox smoothie
[2679.28 - 2683.12] with zeolite too you know and it's like
[2682.00 - 2684.80] no you don't
[2683.12 - 2686.40] um there's a reason why i don't
[2684.80 - 2687.28] recommend zeolite here's a couple of
[2686.40 - 2688.88] reasons too
[2687.28 - 2690.40] the ones on the market don't do what
[2688.88 - 2693.44] they're supposed to do i don't care
[2690.40 - 2695.92] what which one where how when
[2693.44 - 2696.56] i've looked at them all they don't do
[2695.92 - 2698.88] what they do
[2696.56 - 2700.56] so that's important to know the other
[2698.88 - 2704.40] thing is the zeolites
[2700.56 - 2707.44] they take your electrolytes away so
[2704.40 - 2710.48] and yeah be careful bad zeolites
[2707.44 - 2712.32] take your electrolytes away so
[2710.48 - 2714.72] it's not something you're just supposed
[2712.32 - 2715.92] to be pounding down or taken every day
[2714.72 - 2718.24] because
[2715.92 - 2719.04] it will drain your electrolytes that's
[2718.24 - 2721.76] one thing
[2719.04 - 2724.76] and also zeolites tend to they tend to
[2721.76 - 2727.28] dehydrate the body so your cells get
[2724.76 - 2728.40] dehydrated from zeolites so you get the
[2727.28 - 2731.36] zeolites that
[2728.40 - 2732.40] they dehydrate and they also take away
[2731.36 - 2734.32] electrolytes
[2732.40 - 2736.56] right it's what you don't want to do
[2734.32 - 2738.72] it's why i don't recommend it it's why
[2736.56 - 2741.28] i'm not recommending one now
[2738.72 - 2743.04] and you don't you don't need a zeolite
[2741.28 - 2745.20] to get out toxic heavy metals
[2743.04 - 2746.16] there's no zeolite that can leave your
[2745.20 - 2747.52] intestinal tract
[2746.16 - 2749.28] travel through your bloodstream and get
[2747.52 - 2751.52] to your brain
[2749.28 - 2753.52] just so you know there's no zeolite that
[2751.52 - 2754.32] can travel in your bloodstream and get
[2753.52 - 2757.52] to your brain
[2754.32 - 2760.00] and remove metal these zeolites
[2757.52 - 2762.08] all of them they just died along the way
[2760.00 - 2764.24] no one cared anymore because they never
[2762.08 - 2766.64] fixed anybody they never did anything
[2764.24 - 2768.64] so what happens is you know the heavy
[2766.64 - 2770.08] metal detox smoothie blew up around the
[2768.64 - 2772.16] world right
[2770.08 - 2774.04] so it saved lives around the world
[2772.16 - 2776.48] because it gets metals out it's
[2774.04 - 2777.44] life-changing and when you have a
[2776.48 - 2780.24] community
[2777.44 - 2781.76] that has life-changing results that no
[2780.24 - 2782.72] one's ever seen before in all the other
[2781.76 - 2785.84] communities
[2782.72 - 2786.32] you you can sneak in something on the
[2785.84 - 2788.56] sly
[2786.32 - 2790.40] and be like wow i gotta get my zeolite
[2788.56 - 2791.20] in there and start marketing in there i
[2790.40 - 2792.88] gotta get my
[2791.20 - 2794.40] water machine in the medical media
[2792.88 - 2797.04] community start marketing in there
[2794.40 - 2798.80] i gotta get my colostrum in the medical
[2797.04 - 2800.48] medium community i gotta get my
[2798.80 - 2802.32] collagen in the medical medium community
[2800.48 - 2803.84] because everybody's healing in there so
[2802.32 - 2805.52] all you have to do is get all these
[2803.84 - 2808.48] people that are healing
[2805.52 - 2809.92] get all my get all my admins and people
[2808.48 - 2812.00] working on it get all the people that
[2809.92 - 2814.24] work for advertising for the company and
[2812.00 - 2814.64] get them in there commenting 24 7. like
[2814.24 - 2816.96] hey
[2814.64 - 2818.72] try the zeolite hey try the zeolite hey
[2816.96 - 2820.80] try this college and try this collagen
[2818.72 - 2822.72] come combine that with medical medium
[2820.80 - 2825.12] you can take yourself all the way
[2822.72 - 2827.36] and that's the game being played and
[2825.12 - 2828.64] it's really a sad situation really
[2827.36 - 2830.32] because you take something that's
[2828.64 - 2832.56] working and healing somebody
[2830.32 - 2834.40] healing millions really around the world
[2832.56 - 2837.36] because millions of books
[2834.40 - 2839.92] have gotten around the world and and
[2837.36 - 2843.68] that's what that gold emblem right there
[2839.92 - 2845.76] um says and what happens is that then
[2843.68 - 2848.16] you can slip in these things so hey
[2845.76 - 2849.60] let's slip in some charcoal next things
[2848.16 - 2852.16] that don't really work
[2849.60 - 2852.80] let's slip in corella you know and get
[2852.16 - 2855.20] corella
[2852.80 - 2857.20] rebirthed again you know let's get let's
[2855.20 - 2859.36] get zeolite rebirthed again and we can
[2857.20 - 2861.36] do it with the medical medium community
[2859.36 - 2863.04] because medical medium community they're
[2861.36 - 2863.60] all you know they're they're all healing
[2863.04 - 2866.96] there
[2863.60 - 2868.72] and that's that's how it works
[2866.96 - 2870.08] um so i don't recommend zeolites just
[2868.72 - 2873.52] letting you know
[2870.08 - 2874.96] um and what happens is you can do
[2873.52 - 2877.44] something that's not helpful
[2874.96 - 2878.24] but the mm stuff is keeping you afloat
[2877.44 - 2879.52] right
[2878.24 - 2881.36] you're doing your celery juice you're
[2879.52 - 2882.80] doing a heavy metal detox smoothie right
[2881.36 - 2884.08] you're lowering your fats you're doing
[2882.80 - 2885.68] all kinds of you know you're doing your
[2884.08 - 2886.88] healing broth you're doing your spinach
[2885.68 - 2889.76] soups right
[2886.88 - 2891.52] you're working on healing but then
[2889.76 - 2894.56] you're doing zeolite
[2891.52 - 2895.60] and it's working against you right
[2894.56 - 2897.68] it's working against you you're doing
[2895.60 - 2898.64] nutritional yeast it's working against
[2897.68 - 2900.56] you
[2898.64 - 2902.72] you're doing um you know you're doing
[2900.56 - 2904.40] your cruella it's working against you
[2902.72 - 2906.32] you're doing your protein powders it's
[2904.40 - 2909.20] working against you
[2906.32 - 2911.52] see and and but eventually those
[2909.20 - 2912.64] unhealthy things those unhelpful things
[2911.52 - 2915.12] catch up to you
[2912.64 - 2916.96] and they start to tip the balance
[2915.12 - 2918.96] because you might be like
[2916.96 - 2920.56] do like look you might be doing less of
[2918.96 - 2922.40] your celery juice or less of some
[2920.56 - 2924.00] medical medium stuff and it's not now
[2922.40 - 2925.52] keeping you afloat and now you're doing
[2924.00 - 2926.48] the zeolite and the zeolite's
[2925.52 - 2928.56] dehydrating you
[2926.48 - 2930.48] it's dropping down your electrolytes
[2928.56 - 2931.92] okay and then you're doing other stuff
[2930.48 - 2932.88] and that's not helping eventually that
[2931.92 - 2934.48] stuff catches up
[2932.88 - 2935.92] and then you start going down for the
[2934.48 - 2938.96] count a few years later
[2935.92 - 2940.64] and then you think it's mm when it's
[2938.96 - 2942.80] really the zeolite
[2940.64 - 2944.80] i'm only one voice for medical medium
[2942.80 - 2946.40] right you see what these companies do
[2944.80 - 2949.04] they got like 30 people
[2946.40 - 2951.04] hacking away they're working for them
[2949.04 - 2952.96] and then when it's mlmlm they have
[2951.04 - 2954.32] another 50 people and then everybody's
[2952.96 - 2955.28] trying to sell it and everybody's trying
[2954.32 - 2957.60] to sell it
[2955.28 - 2959.36] that's hard to keep up with like they're
[2957.60 - 2961.12] all they got everybody working on it
[2959.36 - 2962.72] chipping away money's being made
[2961.12 - 2964.64] money's being made off the medical meme
[2962.72 - 2965.04] community they got something hot going
[2964.64 - 2967.12] on
[2965.04 - 2969.12] and they got p i'm one voice i'm one
[2967.12 - 2970.96] voice is sitting on here right
[2969.12 - 2972.80] and it's hard to battle that when they
[2970.96 - 2974.32] got like 30 admin and
[2972.80 - 2975.52] they got all the stuff going on and
[2974.32 - 2976.64] they're trying to they're trying to
[2975.52 - 2978.96] infiltrate the group
[2976.64 - 2980.80] the medical medium groups do this deal
[2978.96 - 2983.12] like do the seal like that in the heavy
[2980.80 - 2985.92] metal detox movie is what you do and
[2983.12 - 2986.88] it's it's really unbelievable i don't
[2985.92 - 2989.92] have 30
[2986.88 - 2990.64] 40 50 admins i don't have 30 40 50
[2989.92 - 2993.68] people
[2990.64 - 2993.92] working for me that are on there trying
[2993.68 - 2996.48] to
[2993.92 - 2998.40] clean up messes and and do whatever what
[2996.48 - 2999.04] it is it's just it's it's incredible
[2998.40 - 3001.52] really
[2999.04 - 3003.52] um suzanne does the new book talk about
[3001.52 - 3004.72] gut issues there's a gut health chapter
[3003.52 - 3007.84] in here
[3004.72 - 3009.28] it's it's really a great one um so yeah
[3007.84 - 3012.48] you might want to check it out
[3009.28 - 3014.80] in the new book for sure so
[3012.48 - 3016.40] the whole point is is i can try to i can
[3014.80 - 3016.96] only look out for you guys as much as i
[3016.40 - 3020.88] can
[3016.96 - 3024.40] okay i mean honestly and it's hard to
[3020.88 - 3026.32] battle every single kind of trickery
[3024.40 - 3029.76] that's happening
[3026.32 - 3031.60] zeolite died it died it has a history of
[3029.76 - 3032.16] 20 years of nobody getting better from
[3031.60 - 3033.76] it
[3032.16 - 3035.20] but when you have a community that's
[3033.76 - 3037.60] healing
[3035.20 - 3039.36] actually healing like the medical medium
[3037.60 - 3040.40] human community and that's never been
[3039.36 - 3043.76] seen before
[3040.40 - 3044.80] in our history you can revive old dead
[3043.76 - 3047.60] staples
[3044.80 - 3049.28] like zeolite you can revive it and trick
[3047.60 - 3051.28] out people because
[3049.28 - 3052.72] i you know because i got the word out
[3051.28 - 3054.40] there that people are
[3052.72 - 3055.76] they're filled with toxic heavy metals i
[3054.40 - 3057.84] got that word out there
[3055.76 - 3059.44] so hey it's perfect well zeolite could
[3057.84 - 3061.36] clean that up let's add that in there
[3059.44 - 3063.36] let's revive something that died a long
[3061.36 - 3064.40] time ago that very few people even used
[3063.36 - 3067.36] anymore
[3064.40 - 3068.00] let's bring it back in and try to say
[3067.36 - 3069.20] you could do
[3068.00 - 3070.48] that within you know i don't want to
[3069.20 - 3072.40] hurt anybody's feelings there's some
[3070.48 - 3075.76] really good people that are actually
[3072.40 - 3078.56] good-hearted people that are actually um
[3075.76 - 3079.04] you know trying to push these things and
[3078.56 - 3080.56] and
[3079.04 - 3082.00] their hearts in it and i'm not saying
[3080.56 - 3083.68] anything bad about that i'm just letting

[3121.44 - 3124.96] gonna think it's a new edition

[3126.72 - 3131.12] colorful recipes right
[3128.64 - 3132.24] but i went against the standard in
[3131.12 - 3134.40] publishing
[3132.24 - 3135.28] okay and i think i got my publisher
[3134.40 - 3138.48] upset

[3138.48 - 3142.72] so there's a whole books worth in here
[3140.32 - 3143.20] is what i did and that's why this book
[3142.72 - 3145.92] is
[3143.20 - 3147.20] one heavy and big book do you remember
[3145.92 - 3150.00] the old one
[3147.20 - 3151.68] the old one was light as a feather and
[3150.00 - 3153.20] yeah it was a great book it's saved
[3151.68 - 3154.80] millions of lives around the world with
[3153.20 - 3158.16] what it had in there
[3154.80 - 3159.92] this thing is a beast and uh
[3158.16 - 3161.92] it's got a whole book added to it
[3159.92 - 3165.12] entirely different situation
[3161.92 - 3166.08] um and when people realize that when
[3165.12 - 3166.88] they start reading it they're gonna be
[3166.08 - 3168.32] like oh my god
[3166.88 - 3170.64] i'm gonna plate this up real quick for
[3168.32 - 3170.64] you guys
[3172.48 - 3176.72] so um you guys
[3175.52 - 3179.12] do you guys like when i'm doing the
[3176.72 - 3179.12] cooking

[3181.44 - 3184.64] dinner plus it's fun to do with you guys
[3183.20 - 3188.72] because i have you guys in my kitchen
[3184.64 - 3191.84] which is actually really fun um
[3188.72 - 3193.36] but uh this is just really fun
[3191.84 - 3195.28] i'm gonna plate this up i'm going to put
[3193.36 - 3198.16] a little fresh cilantro on top too if
[3195.28 - 3198.16] you guys don't mind
[3201.52 - 3208.16] okay i'm plating some of this up
[3206.72 - 3210.88] balancing female hormones there's a
[3208.16 - 3212.80] menopause chapter in the new edition
[3210.88 - 3214.56] you might want to check that out it's
[3212.80 - 3216.08] really really interesting
[3214.56 - 3218.48] yeah hormones get out of balance
[3216.08 - 3219.12] absolutely they do but there's more to
[3218.48 - 3222.24] why
[3219.12 - 3223.76] you get symptoms right it's not because
[3222.24 - 3226.00] a lot of the symptoms aren't because
[3223.76 - 3227.52] hormones are not balanced
[3226.00 - 3229.52] that's not the symptoms so when you get
[3227.52 - 3232.64] heart palpitations that's something
[3229.52 - 3235.04] else that's not hormones hot flashes
[3232.64 - 3236.72] that's a stagnant sluggish liver that's
[3235.04 - 3237.36] not hormones that's a stagnant sluggish
[3236.72 - 3239.28] liver
[3237.36 - 3242.16] but what happens is all these symptoms
[3239.28 - 3244.96] get passed off as menopause symptoms or
[3242.16 - 3245.68] hormonal symptoms when really they're
[3244.96 - 3247.12] not
[3245.68 - 3250.00] guys i'm just putting a little fresh
[3247.12 - 3252.64] fresh parsley
[3250.00 - 3255.28] a little bit on top of this like this

[3255.60 - 3259.60] there you go nice little fresh so that's
[3258.16 - 3261.68] the plate right there

[3461.20 - 3465.04] medical medium can be plant-based and
[3463.60 - 3467.68] vegan
[3465.04 - 3469.04] right it can also be animal protein it
[3467.68 - 3471.52] could still heal
[3469.04 - 3472.64] so whatever if you if you're plant-based
[3471.52 - 3474.32] and vegan and that's
[3472.64 - 3476.16] what you feel compelled to go to and go
[3474.32 - 3479.04] that direction mm
[3476.16 - 3480.40] do it absolutely be plant-based be vegan
[3479.04 - 3482.72] absolutely okay
[3480.40 - 3484.16] and then all right if you want to stay
[3482.72 - 3487.44] animal protein
[3484.16 - 3490.40] then we do it right and you can do mm
[3487.44 - 3492.24] while doing animal protein okay because
[3490.40 - 3493.52] medical medium is not just plant-based
[3492.24 - 3495.76] it's for animal protein
[3493.52 - 3497.84] or plant-based it's for either ore and
[3495.76 - 3499.52] you can pick the side you want to be on
[3497.84 - 3501.52] you want to be plant-based and do it
[3499.52 - 3502.08] that way heck yeah we can do it all the
[3501.52 - 3503.52] way
[3502.08 - 3505.52] you want to do with some animal protein
[3503.52 - 3507.76] still can do it okay
[3505.52 - 3508.72] and because people who are plant-based
[3507.76 - 3511.28] still get sick
[3508.72 - 3513.12] unless they're doing it right unless
[3511.28 - 3514.64] they're learning how to heal plant-based
[3513.12 - 3515.76] and people who are animal protein still
[3514.64 - 3517.76] get sick
[3515.76 - 3519.36] unless they learn how to do it right
[3517.76 - 3521.12] doing the animal protein way check out
