[267.00 - 271.80] eating is that true
[269.52 - 273.78] can we all become consumed about what
[271.80 - 276.48] we're eating if you ever hear someone
[273.78 - 278.46] say I don't think about food ever
[276.48 - 281.88] I don't think about food it's not even
[278.46 - 284.70] on my radar I eat when I want to eat
[281.88 - 286.16] I'm not you know what I'm not really I'm
[284.70 - 288.72] not
[286.16 - 291.18] I'm not like stuck with the whole food

[291.18 - 294.90] want whatever right no they're thinking
[293.22 - 296.82] about food all the time that's the whole
[294.90 - 299.16] point if you're a human being on this
[296.82 - 300.36] planet do not get tricked by that if
[299.16 - 302.52] you're a human being on this planet
[300.36 - 305.58] you're thinking about food
[302.52 - 307.26] you are no matter what kind of situation
[305.58 - 308.76] is going on I'm reading a little bit of
[307.26 - 310.68] the eating disorder chapter right here
[308.76 - 312.12] and this chapter is huge and there's a
[310.68 - 315.18] lot of information in it but I'm
[312.12 - 317.46] scratching the surface a little bit
[315.18 - 319.50] are we eating too much
[317.46 - 320.58] has anybody been concerned about are we
[319.50 - 322.32] eating too much
[320.58 - 324.24] that's something I think a lot of people
[322.32 - 326.76] are concerned about
[324.24 - 328.74] are we eating too little have you ever
[326.76 - 330.48] heard that before where there's people
[328.74 - 331.74] that are concerned they're eating too
[330.48 - 333.60] little
[331.74 - 335.10] it's either you're eating too much or
[333.60 - 337.02] you're eating too little what is it
[335.10 - 339.84] right
[337.02 - 343.56] I mean are we eating when we're not
[339.84 - 345.60] hungry have you heard that one before
[343.56 - 347.28] have you felt that like I'm eating when
[345.60 - 348.96] I'm really not even hungry and I'm
[347.28 - 351.00] eating right you hear that one a lot out
[348.96 - 353.22] there do we eat so much we make

[354.96 - 358.80] somebody where it's like they eat so
[356.52 - 362.06] much they make themselves sick

[365.76 - 370.14] seen that before have you been in that
[367.92 - 372.18] world where you're worried about portion

[390.42 - 394.62] daily basis it's another thing people
[392.58 - 396.96] are worried about micromanaging
[394.62 - 399.24] our food on a daily basis
[396.96 - 401.76] do we convince ourselves that we're
[399.24 - 403.50] eating in moderation or eating balanced
[401.76 - 405.60] have you heard that one where people
[403.50 - 407.34] they convince themselves I'm eating in

[442.68 - 446.16] themselves for eating that chocolate
[444.60 - 447.96] cake

[508.50 - 512.10] where day one of the brain shot therapy
[510.18 - 513.42] cleanse challenge we're doing food fear
[512.10 - 516.90] shifter
[513.42 - 519.48] I have this excitement welling up inside
[516.90 - 520.44] of me because I know what's going to
[519.48 - 523.80] happen
[520.44 - 526.92] When anybody participates in this and
[523.80 - 528.84] they do the 20 days with me and they're
[526.92 - 531.54] doing the brain shot therapies every
[528.84 - 533.52] single day and rewiring their brain I
[531.54 - 535.86] know what's going to happen I know the
[533.52 - 537.60] results they're going to get I have an
[535.86 - 540.06] excitement I can't even explain
[537.60 - 542.52] nicolinus as an IG I've had people make
[540.06 - 545.70] me feel bad about food saying you don't
[542.52 - 550.08] need to eat that or you know what to do
[545.70 - 552.12] to lose weight I've always had a bad
[550.08 - 553.86] relationship with food since I was
[552.12 - 556.32] younger
[553.86 - 560.18] let's keep on reading a little bit
[556.32 - 560.18] Eating Disorders are rampant
[560.70 - 565.32] yeah someone's like no they're not yeah
[563.16 - 569.28] they are eating disorders are rampant
[565.32 - 571.56] they can exist in every one of us yes
[569.28 - 573.06] it wouldn't make sense okay here check
[571.56 - 575.52] this out
[573.06 - 577.38] we're all consumed about food if we
[575.52 - 580.08] weren't it wouldn't make sense because
[577.38 - 581.76] we have to be concerned about food when
[580.08 - 584.10] people say I'm not concerned about food
[581.76 - 587.58] that's not me I have no concerns about
[584.10 - 590.66] food b s
[587.58 - 594.00] capital b capital s
[590.66 - 596.40] everybody's concerned about food or
[594.00 - 599.96] they're an alien and they're not you
[596.40 - 599.96] know aliens are concerned about food
[601.32 - 607.92] everybody's concerned about food
[604.38 - 610.38] or you cease to exist it's just an uh
[607.92 - 612.42] you know on our radar
[610.38 - 614.10] if we weren't it wouldn't make sense
[612.42 - 617.82] because we have to be concerned about
[614.10 - 619.86] food it's how we live work play function
[617.82 - 621.78] you want to function you got to be
[619.86 - 624.42] concerned about food
[621.78 - 626.70] loving healing says I used to be I used
[624.42 - 628.86] to stress so much about food always so
[626.70 - 630.96] much Obsession and guilt two years on
[628.86 - 633.84] medical medium protocols and I feel so
[630.96 - 635.22] free food makes me happy now no more
[633.84 - 636.72] guilt that's what I love about the
[635.22 - 639.66] medical medium
[636.72 - 642.78] food protocols in the medical medium
[639.66 - 645.18] cleanses in the medical medium words of
[642.78 - 647.84] wisdom from above because it frees us
[645.18 - 647.84] from that
[648.72 - 652.86] it really does
[650.64 - 657.68] that's always been a part of our history
[652.86 - 657.68] as humans we are focused on food right
[657.72 - 663.78] what makes it a food disorder in today's
[660.90 - 665.94] modern world is the amount of unhealthy
[663.78 - 670.22] conditioning all around us combined with
[665.94 - 670.22] contaminants in our brains so
[670.98 - 675.96] food disorders can happen from our
[673.32 - 677.88] brains being saturated with all kinds of
[675.96 - 680.10] contaminations and all kinds of
[677.88 - 682.26] different stuff that I talk about in the
[680.10 - 684.12] medical medium book series our brains
[682.26 - 687.50] get filled with it and that could make
[684.12 - 687.50] things a lot more difficult
[687.66 - 691.92] and so what we have to do is learn how
[689.94 - 694.02] to eat in order and not have an eating
[691.92 - 697.80] disorder it's more of like what can I
[694.02 - 700.02] eat to heal myself what can I eat that's
[697.80 - 702.72] going to change my life and turn my life
[700.02 - 705.36] around there's nothing wrong with having
[702.72 - 707.52] that sense of understanding and that
[705.36 - 709.32] sense of knowing there's nothing wrong
[707.52 - 711.24] with being like what can I eat to get
[709.32 - 714.72] myself better what can I eat to heal
[711.24 - 718.20] what can I eat to turn my life around
[714.72 - 720.06] what's wrong with that nothing nothing's
[718.20 - 721.56] wrong with that that's eating in order
[720.06 - 722.94] that's putting things in perspective
[721.56 - 724.98] that's putting things in order that's
[722.94 - 727.38] putting things in the right situation
[724.98 - 729.60] for your body it's like no I want to eat
[727.38 - 730.68] to heal right
[729.60 - 733.32] thank you
[730.68 - 737.10] eating in order can have a few meanings
[733.32 - 739.14] eating in order to heal
[737.10 - 742.26] in order to heal
[739.14 - 745.08] I gotta eat a certain way right now
[742.26 - 749.54] in order to heal
[745.08 - 749.54] okay eating in order to live
[749.70 - 753.90] if I want to live
[751.50 - 756.06] I'm gonna be eating eating in order to
[753.90 - 759.12] survive if I want to survive eating in
[756.06 - 762.12] order to thrive I want to thrive
[759.12 - 765.78] these brain shot therapies after 20 days
[762.12 - 768.48] of these brains out there after today
[765.78 - 771.24] it just starts to happen the the power
[768.48 - 773.46] of these brain shot therapies just blows
[771.24 - 776.04] me away eating in order to function I
[773.46 - 778.92] want to eat to function
[776.04 - 781.44] eating in order to succeed I want to
[778.92 - 785.04] succeed I want to be productive I want
[781.44 - 787.26] to heal I want to
[785.04 - 788.70] I want to be successful in anything I do
[787.26 - 790.56] doesn't matter what it is even if it's
[788.70 - 793.64] just cleaning my kitchen I want to be
[790.56 - 793.64] successful at it
[794.58 - 799.50] by the way I clean the kitchen yes I do
[798.06 - 801.18] someone said to me the other day you
[799.50 - 803.94] don't clean up stuff you don't do that
[801.18 - 807.00] you don't vacuum clean yeah I do
[803.94 - 809.40] I do all that stuff why those are
[807.00 - 812.36] beneath me no they're not
[809.40 - 812.36] you better believe
[812.40 - 816.42] so yeah
[813.72 - 818.94] so why Colin says I need to download
[816.42 - 822.92] that Mantra in my brain what can I eat
[818.94 - 822.92] to heal what can I eat to heal
[823.08 - 827.88] a focus on food is not on its own
[826.08 - 830.04] unhealthy
[827.88 - 832.74] do not let anybody convince you that
[830.04 - 834.84] focusing on food is unhealthy don't let
[832.74 - 838.56] someone convince you of that that's a
[834.84 - 840.30] bad convincing I'm serious that is not a
[838.56 - 842.46] good thing
[840.30 - 844.80] often when we're trying to take care of
[842.46 - 847.32] ourselves holistically and heal from
[844.80 - 849.90] symptoms and conditions buying the right
[847.32 - 851.88] Foods consuming fruits vegetables eating
[849.90 - 854.28] less processed foods looking after
[851.88 - 856.98] ourselves in general we can feel like
[854.28 - 859.68] we're trapped and we're alone and
[856.98 - 863.16] worried about food in a bubble of our
[859.68 - 864.96] own world unless we find our others like
[863.16 - 866.88] us right so that's another thing once
[864.96 - 868.80] you have to start healing and start
[866.88 - 870.42] eating better we can feel like lonely
[868.80 - 872.70] and lost and we're like stuck in this
[870.42 - 874.82] bubble
[872.70 - 877.56] foreign
[874.82 - 879.78] alone and worried about food in a bubble
[877.56 - 882.06] of our own world unless we find others
[879.78 - 885.54] like us even when we're doing it right
[882.06 - 888.06] life becomes all about what to eat how
[885.54 - 890.64] healthy it is where to find it we can
[888.06 - 892.38] get lost wondering does anyone else have
[890.64 - 894.90] to worry about this so here's what I'm
[892.38 - 897.12] talking about right here okay as you
[894.90 - 899.34] Embark in healing and you're using food
[897.12 - 902.78] to fix your brain and you're using food
[899.34 - 905.70] to fix yourself and heal
[902.78 - 907.74] physically emotionally right mentally
[905.70 - 908.52] spiritually you're you're using food to
[907.74 - 910.98] heal
[908.52 - 913.38] it's gonna feel weird because it's going
[910.98 - 915.78] to look like nobody else is you guys
[913.38 - 918.12] it's going to look like no one else out
[915.78 - 920.70] there is using food to heal no one else
[918.12 - 922.14] is out there is focused on food you see
[920.70 - 924.42] people in the streets you see people
[922.14 - 926.04] driving by you see people whatever and
[924.42 - 927.96] you're gonna think they're not like you
[926.04 - 930.18] they don't have to worry about anything
[927.96 - 932.04] but they're still worried to some degree
[930.18 - 933.78] even if they're not eating healthy
[932.04 - 936.72] they're still worried about what they're
[933.78 - 939.12] eating everybody is worried about what
[936.72 - 942.44] they're eating whether they say it or
[939.12 - 942.44] not or tell you or not
[943.32 - 950.12] yes every single person on this planet
[945.78 - 950.12] has to worry about food it's natural
[951.18 - 955.38] when you're trying to heal particular
[952.92 - 957.78] illnesses and diseases and conditions
[955.38 - 959.52] and symptoms it's especially natural to
[957.78 - 961.14] worry about what you're eating if you're
[959.52 - 962.94] trying to heal something if you're
[961.14 - 964.32] trying to fix something in here if
[962.94 - 966.12] you're trying to fix something in here
[964.32 - 968.76] something's wrong you got those
[966.12 - 970.98] autoimmune diagnoses you got all kinds
[968.76 - 972.72] of anxiety and depression you guys got
[970.98 - 974.94] all kinds of problems people have right
[972.72 - 976.92] that everybody has you guys if any
[974.94 - 978.78] things like that is happening you're
[976.92 - 981.14] working on trying to heal it that's what
[978.78 - 981.14] you're doing
[982.14 - 987.66] you do have to be extra mindful about
[984.66 - 990.12] what you eat if that mindfulness about
[987.66 - 992.88] food is done the wrong way it can
[990.12 - 995.76] contribute to an eating disorder
[992.88 - 997.20] if it's done the right way
[995.76 - 998.94] this is important this is when the
[997.20 - 1001.28] details matter right here it's one of
[998.94 - 1002.84] the places it matters it can correct an
[1001.28 - 1004.52] eating disorder and teach you how to eat
[1002.84 - 1006.98] properly

[1009.32 - 1013.22] to heal
[1010.76 - 1014.90] it can create an eating disorder in a

[1136.94 - 1141.76] let's get down to it right now
[1139.28 - 1141.76] okay
[1142.88 - 1148.16] eating the right items at the right time
[1145.16 - 1151.10] can still feel as if you have an eating
[1148.16 - 1153.26] disorder because of how others view it
[1151.10 - 1155.18] others view it
[1153.26 - 1157.82] one of the problems when you're trying
[1155.18 - 1160.52] to heal is what others are viewing of
[1157.82 - 1162.50] what you're doing
[1160.52 - 1164.36] that's one of the problems
[1162.50 - 1165.86] when you're trying to heal is what
[1164.36 - 1168.44] others are viewing
[1165.86 - 1171.26] other people are judging other people
[1168.44 - 1173.66] got their eyes on you right how many
[1171.26 - 1174.50] people have their eyes there's eyes on
[1173.66 - 1176.84] them
[1174.50 - 1178.76] keep that in mind because that can then
[1176.84 - 1180.38] Propel someone to feel like they're
[1178.76 - 1181.70] doing it wrong that they're in an eating
[1180.38 - 1184.16] disorder
[1181.70 - 1186.74] when you're trying to eat healthy others
[1184.16 - 1188.42] often see it as too rigid
[1186.74 - 1191.42] what do you do in your celery juice
[1188.42 - 1193.04] again you're doing your celery juice one
[1191.42 - 1195.74] more time what do you do in your brain
[1193.04 - 1198.46] shot therapy one more time is it a
[1195.74 - 1198.46] little too much
[1199.28 - 1206.54] they may even even label it orthorexia
[1203.20 - 1211.06] orthorexic right
[1206.54 - 1211.06] when someone scoffs down a cheese pizza
[1212.06 - 1216.26] right
[1214.16 - 1218.42] in a Coca-Cola
[1216.26 - 1222.16] and they're calling you orthorexic
[1218.42 - 1222.16] because you're trying to heal yourself
[1223.10 - 1227.54] let's just insane
[1224.84 - 1230.72] Erica Alex says and that mm protocols
[1227.54 - 1232.82] healed my worsening bulimia whoa that I
[1230.72 - 1235.88] suffered with for years

[1235.88 - 1240.44] healing so many people have been through
[1237.80 - 1242.60] that and it's it's just so hard I tried
[1240.44 - 1244.58] doctors and therapists and nothing
[1242.60 - 1246.62] worked when all hope was lost the
[1244.58 - 1250.42] medical medium healed me completely with
[1246.62 - 1250.42] no relapses incredible
[1250.52 - 1254.96] so when someone names somebody
[1252.20 - 1257.00] orthorexic which you'll read about later
[1254.96 - 1258.92] in this chapter I have an orthorexia
[1257.00 - 1261.08] section in this chapter you've got to
[1258.92 - 1263.72] read this book brand saver Michelle L
[1261.08 - 1268.16] says the bullying about what I eat has
[1263.72 - 1268.16] been unbelievable capitalized
[1269.30 - 1273.56] okay
[1271.34 - 1275.24] they may even label it orthorexia which
[1273.56 - 1278.00] you'll read about later this chapter you
[1275.24 - 1280.22] can get blamed for too much fruit
[1278.00 - 1282.44] how many of you been blamed for too much
[1280.22 - 1284.96] fruit first of all fruit wasn't allowed
[1282.44 - 1287.78] in any of the eat better diets out there
[1284.96 - 1290.84] medical medium
[1287.78 - 1293.84] spent the last 30 plus years bringing
[1290.84 - 1296.54] fruit into the health world because it
[1293.84 - 1299.48] wasn't allowed
[1296.54 - 1303.20] the only place fruit was allowed was
[1299.48 - 1305.06] believe it or not the the food pyramid
[1303.20 - 1307.58] where they said you still should have
[1305.06 - 1310.70] some servings of fruit meanwhile in all
[1307.58 - 1314.30] of the health realm Alternative Health
[1310.70 - 1317.06] fruit was never allowed it was demonized
[1314.30 - 1319.64] and I spent decades trying to bring it
[1317.06 - 1321.26] in right and then medical medium info
[1319.64 - 1323.18] with the millions of books around the
[1321.26 - 1325.40] world and all of the people seeing that
[1323.18 - 1327.26] fruit and the wild blueberries now all
[1325.40 - 1329.60] the eat better guys that were like

[1329.60 - 1334.22] because they change their colors every
[1332.06 - 1336.92] second they're lizards and now like yes

[1341.60 - 1345.56] foreign
[1342.50 - 1347.30] but fruit is is critical but how many
[1345.56 - 1350.54] people were blamed for eating fruit
[1347.30 - 1354.46] Laura Robinson says mm has healed me and
[1350.54 - 1356.72] my hair is thicker and stronger amazing
[1354.46 - 1359.42] hey have you heard this before not
[1356.72 - 1361.88] enough protein

[1361.88 - 1366.28] your protein protein robot we'll do that
[1365.18 - 1369.50] half time
[1366.28 - 1371.72] too many carbs whoa that's too many
[1369.50 - 1373.88] carbs don't eat that banana first of all
[1371.72 - 1375.68] it's a fruit and it's way too many carbs
[1373.88 - 1377.60] how about that one how many people are
[1375.68 - 1379.64] said to that lizards is right I saw that
[1377.60 - 1381.80] on IG you like that one lizards it's
[1379.64 - 1384.02] endless bringing your own food to
[1381.80 - 1386.00] holidays is difficult not eating at
[1384.02 - 1389.24] events where the menu doesn't work for
[1386.00 - 1392.60] you always packing snacks orientating
[1389.24 - 1394.72] your life around the farmers markets or
[1392.60 - 1397.34] making special requests at restaurants
[1394.72 - 1399.26] none of this should be considered an
[1397.34 - 1402.26] eating disorder when what you're doing
[1399.26 - 1404.90] is eating in order to truly heal did you
[1402.26 - 1406.94] guys hear that how many people get
[1404.90 - 1408.98] punished for actually picking and
[1406.94 - 1411.14] choosing at the restaurant packing
[1408.98 - 1413.36] snacks making sure you're taking care of
[1411.14 - 1416.60] yourself having like your fruit with you
[1413.36 - 1418.70] okay all of that how many people are
[1416.60 - 1421.76] punished for making special requests in
[1418.70 - 1424.70] restaurants or punished for like
[1421.76 - 1428.30] bringing their food to an event or not
[1424.70 - 1432.56] so many people are punished in that way
[1428.30 - 1435.08] now don't we want to feel normal
[1432.56 - 1437.30] to go out and eat a pizza or some fried
[1435.08 - 1439.94] food or cheesy pasta or a grass-fed
[1437.30 - 1441.98] burger or maybe some sushi
[1439.94 - 1444.08] to go over to a friend's house and eat
[1441.98 - 1445.34] whatever they're serving have ice cream
[1444.08 - 1447.38] afterwards
[1445.34 - 1448.94] to eat whatever's on the table at a
[1447.38 - 1451.82] family holiday without worrying about
[1448.94 - 1454.58] how it's going to affect your bloating
[1451.82 - 1456.32] your stomach your cramps your gastritis
[1454.58 - 1457.70] your diarrhea your constipation your
[1456.32 - 1459.44] heartburn your acid reflux your
[1457.70 - 1464.24] indigestion and acne
[1459.44 - 1466.16] we all want to feel normal right we all
[1464.24 - 1469.04] want to scoff down that cheese pizza no
[1466.16 - 1471.86] problem and eat whatever we want to do
[1469.04 - 1473.66] the irony is that all the people who
[1471.86 - 1475.06] seem normal
[1473.66 - 1478.46] actually
[1475.06 - 1481.84] normalize dysfunctional eating and have
[1478.46 - 1481.84] Eating Disorders themselves
[1484.76 - 1489.62] I mean seriously
[1487.82 - 1492.14] so that's what's happening out there
[1489.62 - 1494.30] right everybody wants to be normal but
[1492.14 - 1497.12] the whole thing is that normal our
[1494.30 - 1500.30] Eating Disorders that's the whole point
[1497.12 - 1503.48] let's see rolanki says yes the
[1500.30 - 1506.60] functional doctors did all cat good
[1503.48 - 1510.14] sensitivity Foods food sensitivity tests
[1506.60 - 1511.94] and I couldn't eat this and many veggies
[1510.14 - 1513.74] were out too it was horrible that's
[1511.94 - 1515.60] another thing the food sensitivity test
[1513.74 - 1517.58] that I've watched people go through hell
[1515.60 - 1520.64] with for years
[1517.58 - 1523.64] and what happened to their food eating
[1520.64 - 1525.92] I always say this okay
[1523.64 - 1528.02] so functional doctors said don't eat
[1525.92 - 1529.46] fruits and certain vegetables and that
[1528.02 - 1531.14] whole thing right so then you you're
[1529.46 - 1533.18] stuck with this food sensitivity test
[1531.14 - 1536.78] where you were just eating what meat and
[1533.18 - 1539.60] meat only right red Rosia says or eat
[1536.78 - 1541.88] this burger and eat this pork rib you
[1539.60 - 1543.74] need to gain weight as if that's the
[1541.88 - 1546.20] only way to gain weight I could eat
[1543.74 - 1548.84] clean and Gain
[1546.20 - 1551.36] I think what people don't realize
[1548.84 - 1553.58] really is that how many people are
[1551.36 - 1554.78] ostracized and made fun of for trying to
[1553.58 - 1558.62] eat
[1554.78 - 1560.90] healthy for real healthy right
[1558.62 - 1562.64] Hillary said
[1560.90 - 1565.22] my eating disorder was completely
[1562.64 - 1568.22] obliterated when I learned and applied
[1565.22 - 1571.52] these protocols and I don't apply it as
[1568.22 - 1573.98] often as I want but I am still healed
[1571.52 - 1575.96] from that incredible
[1573.98 - 1578.42] look you know you can always come back
[1575.96 - 1582.02] as well come back to the medical medium
[1578.42 - 1585.26] information too you can always come back
[1582.02 - 1587.06] and then here's what I've noticed some
[1585.26 - 1589.28] people in their life when they get a
[1587.06 - 1590.66] medical medium book and they read it
[1589.28 - 1593.06] they're at a different point in their
[1590.66 - 1595.28] life and they need to come back to it
[1593.06 - 1596.84] years later and then they read it and
[1595.28 - 1598.88] they see it in a whole different light
[1596.84 - 1601.40] they're like why didn't I see it that
[1598.88 - 1604.18] way what happened why did I just lose
[1601.40 - 1604.18] two more years
[1606.56 - 1611.84] all right so we all want to feel normal
[1609.20 - 1613.94] the irony is that with all the people
[1611.84 - 1615.74] who seem normal actually normalize
[1613.94 - 1617.84] dysfunctional eating and have Eating
[1615.74 - 1620.30] Disorders themselves they don't eat
[1617.84 - 1625.04] correctly no one has ever been taught
[1620.30 - 1628.34] what our brain and body need what foods
[1625.04 - 1630.62] our organs need what foods to eat for a
[1628.34 - 1632.06] physical spiritual emotional and mental
[1630.62 - 1635.36] health
[1632.06 - 1638.72] were left to our own demise here on
[1635.36 - 1641.66] planet Earth no one has taught the right
[1638.72 - 1644.42] things it's painstaking and here's a
[1641.66 - 1646.94] point I just want to be clear about you
[1644.42 - 1650.48] tell me if this point is or not
[1646.94 - 1653.84] you tell me go ahead judge me I need you
[1650.48 - 1656.06] guys to judge me on this point right
[1653.84 - 1659.06] you got all these eat betters you know
[1656.06 - 1661.04] things out there books and programs you
[1659.06 - 1663.26] got all these exactly all cat tests and
[1661.04 - 1665.78] food sensitivity tests
[1663.26 - 1667.82] but what do you think about this
[1665.78 - 1669.44] all those professionals don't know why
[1667.82 - 1671.60] we're sick science and research doesn't
[1669.44 - 1674.30] know why we're sick they don't they
[1671.60 - 1676.16] don't have the answers but yet they're
[1674.30 - 1678.08] right about what you should be eating I
[1676.16 - 1681.52] guess
[1678.08 - 1681.52] am I wrong to say that
[1681.56 - 1685.58] so they're right about what you should
[1683.54 - 1689.30] be eating when they don't know why
[1685.58 - 1692.24] you're even sick the true cause
[1689.30 - 1693.14] and what's bringing you down in your
[1692.24 - 1695.72] life
[1693.14 - 1700.10] and why you're suffering if they don't
[1695.72 - 1703.84] know why why why then why are they right
[1700.10 - 1703.84] and what they're telling you to eat
[1707.18 - 1712.94] when I think about that I'm like okay
[1710.24 - 1716.00] in order to heal you have to get your
[1712.94 - 1718.04] Foods figured out
[1716.00 - 1719.72] you have to understand your foods and
[1718.04 - 1721.04] get them in order
[1719.72 - 1722.72] that's what we're doing right now we're
[1721.04 - 1725.00] doing the brain shot therapy cleanse
[1722.72 - 1728.12] challenge right 20 days of it that alone
[1725.00 - 1729.92] is a powerful tool and that's what we're
[1728.12 - 1731.66] doing right now you have to understand
[1729.92 - 1734.00] your foods and get them in order when
[1731.66 - 1736.10] your foods are in disorder that's when
[1734.00 - 1737.84] you get an eating disorder when you
[1736.10 - 1739.58] don't know what the hell we eat when the
[1737.84 - 1740.90] hell to eat it well you don't know what
[1739.58 - 1743.72] you're doing
[1740.90 - 1745.28] The Whole World's all scrambled up as to
[1743.72 - 1746.60] what's good for you eggs are good for
[1745.28 - 1748.58] you you need your protein make sure
[1746.60 - 1751.64] you're on your eggs you need a good hard
[1748.58 - 1754.04] cheese don't do the American soft cheese
[1751.64 - 1756.08] you need a good hard cheese as if that's
[1754.04 - 1758.90] the answer you need to eat good butter
[1756.08 - 1760.46] grass-fed butter that's the answer you
[1758.90 - 1762.20] need to be a vegan you need to be a
[1760.46 - 1764.48] plant-based person you need to be eating
[1762.20 - 1766.16] lots of nut Butters only like the amount
[1764.48 - 1767.42] of stuff you need to be carnivore you
[1766.16 - 1770.90] need to be this
[1767.42 - 1773.42] like it's Insanity out there and that
[1770.90 - 1776.38] Insanity alone can create Eating
[1773.42 - 1776.38] Disorders already
[1777.68 - 1782.06] many times
[1779.90 - 1783.68] all right
[1782.06 - 1785.00] you have to understand your foods and
[1783.68 - 1786.26] get them in order when your foods are in
[1785.00 - 1788.90] disorder that's when you can get an
[1786.26 - 1790.94] eating disorder everyone has has been
[1788.90 - 1792.50] there wondering what to eat and everyone
[1790.94 - 1794.84] is guessing
[1792.50 - 1797.12] guessing that's what I was trying to say
[1794.84 - 1798.80] all right you guys read a little bit
[1797.12 - 1800.30] more but I'm just telling you right now
[1798.80 - 1802.52] we're day one
[1800.30 - 1806.60] we're doing 20 days call me crazy
[1802.52 - 1809.24] because that's one killer long cleanse
[1806.60 - 1812.84] and I'm excited about it so I'm on page
[1809.24 - 1814.88] 273 in Eating Disorders chapters where I
[1812.84 - 1817.58] am I got more to go
[1814.88 - 1820.88] so let's go a little bit more many times
[1817.58 - 1822.80] food contributes to not feeling well
[1820.88 - 1824.84] eating foods that are not appropriate
[1822.80 - 1826.76] for healing can contribute to developing
[1824.84 - 1829.40] a condition illness or disease
[1826.76 - 1831.38] contributing
[1829.40 - 1834.14] not the cause
[1831.38 - 1836.12] but contributing keep that in mind so
[1834.14 - 1838.52] what seemed to be normal eating normal
[1836.12 - 1840.86] acting normal being normal with food
[1838.52 - 1843.50] wasn't a good normal because it was
[1840.86 - 1845.96] contributing to someone getting sick
[1843.50 - 1848.54] eating normal acting normal being normal
[1845.96 - 1850.34] with food wasn't a good normal it's it
[1848.54 - 1852.32] might have seemed like a good normal
[1850.34 - 1854.24] because you were with family and friends
[1852.32 - 1856.04] it might have seemed like a good normal
[1854.24 - 1858.14] because the food seemed tasty and
[1856.04 - 1860.84] satiating it might have seemed like a
[1858.14 - 1862.94] good normal because it was convenient is
[1860.84 - 1865.22] your mind blowing right now like sure am
[1862.94 - 1866.90] I just blowing up it might have seemed
[1865.22 - 1868.94] like a good normal because it offered
[1866.90 - 1872.06] comforting Sensations that connected you
[1868.94 - 1876.32] with past memories in life
[1872.06 - 1878.30] it wasn't good for other reasons though
[1876.32 - 1880.70] people who try to use food to heal
[1878.30 - 1883.70] especially young people will frequently
[1880.70 - 1885.56] be blamed for disordered eating in the
[1883.70 - 1888.74] older days it was even more common
[1885.56 - 1891.14] particularly if it was a young adult
[1888.74 - 1893.42] trying to heal from chronic illness by
[1891.14 - 1896.12] eating fruits and vegetables they could
[1893.42 - 1898.46] be taken to a clinic and force-fed
[1896.12 - 1900.32] prompted by well-meaning family members
[1898.46 - 1902.36] who were actually the ones with the
[1900.32 - 1903.98] Eating Disorders did that ever happen to
[1902.36 - 1906.14] any of you guys
[1903.98 - 1908.42] a lot of you guys you got you know you
[1906.14 - 1911.60] got you're seasoned you got some years

[1911.60 - 1917.24] old or 20 years old right maybe you've
[1914.42 - 1919.34] had this happen to you a long time ago
[1917.24 - 1920.96] where a family just basically said we're
[1919.34 - 1922.64] just taking you out of here because
[1920.96 - 1924.74] you're trying to heal and you're trying
[1922.64 - 1926.54] to eat carrots and we're just we gotta
[1924.74 - 1929.38] just take you out of here and put you in
[1926.54 - 1929.38] a clinic somewhere
[1929.80 - 1933.68] radioactive heart says yeah it's
[1931.58 - 1937.22] exhausting I feel like everybody jumps
[1933.68 - 1941.06] up and down in joy I eat badly and I
[1937.22 - 1943.94] made fun of for being sick
[1941.06 - 1946.16] I think it's moving up and down so hold
[1943.94 - 1948.14] on so you're saying let me read it again
[1946.16 - 1949.70] radioactive heart yeah it's exhausting I
[1948.14 - 1953.18] feel like everybody jumps up and down
[1949.70 - 1957.38] enjoy if I eat badly and I made fun of
[1953.18 - 1960.74] got you got you being being sick and
[1957.38 - 1962.54] Bones I feel ostracized trying to figure
[1960.74 - 1965.48] out my health problems totally
[1962.54 - 1968.26] understand I feel for you and I get it I
[1965.48 - 1968.26] do I do
[1969.62 - 1974.12] we're in a better safer place now with
[1971.90 - 1976.40] food than we were just two decades ago
[1974.12 - 1978.50] people can be dragged out of their
[1976.40 - 1981.56] houses
[1978.50 - 1985.96] by guys in white coats putting you in
[1981.56 - 1985.96] straight jackets years ago it was done
[1986.12 - 1990.38] it's just terrifying
[1988.46 - 1992.90] bring in more plant Foods is more
[1990.38 - 1994.94] accepted not fully accept it believe it
[1992.90 - 1997.64] or not but more accepted just becoming
[1994.94 - 1999.20] more upset accepted a lot of confusion
[1997.64 - 2001.60] around eating disorders and healthy
[1999.20 - 2003.22] eating remains and rightfully so there
[2001.60 - 2005.14] are many Trends in the health field that
[2003.22 - 2006.88] aren't right for the body and they can
[2005.14 - 2008.44] rain on the parade of better approaches
[2006.88 - 2011.32] and holistic health
[2008.44 - 2013.36] medical meme information has healed so
[2011.32 - 2014.86] many people around the world
[2013.36 - 2018.16] but there's
[2014.86 - 2020.14] Trends out there that ruin it
[2018.16 - 2022.06] because they're so scrambled up with
[2020.14 - 2023.86] misinformation
[2022.06 - 2026.08] some health professionals become
[2023.86 - 2027.82] Reckless and it ends up looking bad for
[2026.08 - 2030.10] everyone in the natural health field
[2027.82 - 2033.10] people venturing into certain cleanses
[2030.10 - 2035.08] certain detox programs and certain diets
[2033.10 - 2036.58] already have eating disorders and when
[2035.08 - 2038.38] they do these Reckless diets and
[2036.58 - 2039.46] cleanses it worsens their eating
[2038.38 - 2041.56] disorders
[2039.46 - 2043.18] creating more confusion fear and
[2041.56 - 2045.94] frustration this is critical right here
[2043.18 - 2047.92] this could give Healthy eating a bad
[2045.94 - 2050.14] name and even start a new eating
[2047.92 - 2052.36] disorder because the makers of these
[2050.14 - 2054.28] diets and programs out there have no
[2052.36 - 2055.66] idea why anyone is sick to begin with
[2054.28 - 2058.30] that's the point right there you guys
[2055.66 - 2060.64] it's a huge point they have no idea why
[2058.30 - 2063.70] anybody is sick to begin with why should
[2060.64 - 2065.50] I trust medical mediums protocols
[2063.70 - 2066.70] because you finally have answers why
[2065.50 - 2068.68] you're sick
[2066.70 - 2071.50] why should I track why should I trust
[2068.68 - 2073.42] medical medium food protocols and his
[2071.50 - 2076.06] lenses
[2073.42 - 2078.34] because you know why you got sick to
[2076.06 - 2080.92] begin with why shouldn't I trust those
[2078.34 - 2083.02] out there they don't know why anyone got
[2080.92 - 2085.78] sick because the makers of the diets and
[2083.02 - 2087.82] programs have no idea why anyone is sick
[2085.78 - 2090.94] to begin with so the information they
[2087.82 - 2093.82] are giving others to use
[2090.94 - 2095.62] is not in a good order for the body
[2093.82 - 2097.84] all right you guys let's get moving on
[2095.62 - 2100.06] we got a half time coming up

[2833.74 - 2837.04] Drake Clark
[2835.30 - 2839.14] what are the rules for doing three
[2837.04 - 2841.30] different shots in one day how many
[2839.14 - 2844.06] hours apart
[2841.30 - 2847.18] if you read the book it says space them
[2844.06 - 2849.52] four hours apart
[2847.18 - 2851.26] if you read the book
[2849.52 - 2852.94] okay guys
[2851.26 - 2854.62] food for your shifter are you doing it
[2852.94 - 2857.56] with me right now
[2854.62 - 2859.00] are we doing it together so that's about
[2857.56 - 2860.92] tightly packed because I'm talking about
[2859.00 - 2862.42] tightly packed right there let's move
[2860.92 - 2865.84] into the next one
[2862.42 - 2868.66] three quarters of a cup of
[2865.84 - 2872.68] sword mango
[2868.66 - 2874.90] Frozen mango works or you can do fresh
[2872.68 - 2878.02] mango I don't have a fresh mango right
[2874.90 - 2882.40] now but I love love love love
[2878.02 - 2884.80] Frozen mango too okay there we go
[2882.40 - 2886.66] nice
[2884.80 - 2890.26] and then we're gonna go with some celery
[2886.66 - 2894.06] right a quarter of a stock
[2890.26 - 2894.06] let's get some celery down in there
[2895.90 - 2900.28] incredible
[2897.70 - 2902.98] now the amazing thing about these shots
[2900.28 - 2905.50] is they're so potent you can feel it as
[2902.98 - 2907.42] it's entering you so keep that in mind
[2905.50 - 2910.12] okay
[2907.42 - 2912.28] now what I have on here I have the if
[2910.12 - 2915.22] you have this juicer I have the celery
[2912.28 - 2918.64] end cap the high compression
[2915.22 - 2922.36] right and what that does is it squeezes
[2918.64 - 2923.26] every last drop practically out of the
[2922.36 - 2926.38] food
[2923.26 - 2928.66] so this is the Omega mm 1500 if you're
[2926.38 - 2930.94] curious right
[2928.66 - 2932.62] and you can just you can just juice with
[2930.94 - 2935.14] this all day if you wanted to juice and
[2932.62 - 2936.94] stuff but what's powerful about this
[2935.14 - 2938.50] is what you're going to see is you're
[2936.94 - 2941.38] not going to see
[2938.50 - 2943.90] all this wet sloppy stuff come out of
[2941.38 - 2945.70] this end if that's the case you're going
[2943.90 - 2948.04] to need like a lot of other juicers
[2945.70 - 2951.10] you're going to need instead of a half
[2948.04 - 2953.26] cup of spinach or a half cup of Dill
[2951.10 - 2956.32] you're going to need that much still
[2953.26 - 2958.12] probably that much spinach because it's
[2956.32 - 2960.16] all going to come out the pulp's going
[2958.12 - 2961.96] to come out flying sloppy it's just
[2960.16 - 2962.98] going to be sloppy mushy you know wet
[2961.96 - 2966.00] right
[2962.98 - 2966.00] okay there we go
[2967.18 - 2972.96] so I have a screen on here so I'm just
[2969.70 - 2972.96] moving some of it through the screen
[2973.90 - 2977.04] okay there we go
[2978.30 - 2983.98] and if you want to
[2982.12 - 2986.20] all right I'm gonna take my screen off
[2983.98 - 2987.82] for the second here that's my shot right
[2986.20 - 2990.16] there
[2987.82 - 2993.54] didn't even need that it was incredible
[2990.16 - 2993.54] didn't even need this
[2993.94 - 2996.48] all right
[3002.34 - 3007.04] let me show you this right up close
[3004.14 - 3007.04] maybe we'll even

[3024.95 - 3030.01] [Music]
[3032.70 - 3036.84] there's a feeling I get
[3034.74 - 3038.88] and there you guys do these shots so you
[3036.84 - 3041.70] know what I'm talking about right where
[3038.88 - 3044.52] it just starts to come over you
[3041.70 - 3048.32] because it's about the combination the
[3044.52 - 3048.32] amounts and what it's for
[3049.14 - 3055.08] that's my second little step
[3052.20 - 3056.33] I'm nursing this one for the moment
[3055.08 - 3058.80] but I could feel it
[3056.33 - 3060.54] [Music]
[3058.80 - 3062.28] I get like a charge
[3060.54 - 3065.76] right now I'm feeling like I'm getting
[3062.28 - 3068.10] charged up all here
[3065.76 - 3069.60] right from the brain stem really it
[3068.10 - 3072.12] feels like the brain stem is getting
[3069.60 - 3074.82] charged so I feel energy moving through
[3072.12 - 3076.50] the brain stem right now I don't feel it
[3074.82 - 3079.58] on the top I feel it in the brain stem
[3076.50 - 3079.58] area right now for me

[3116.04 - 3119.46] you can
[3117.24 - 3121.68] put them in the fridge in an airtight
[3119.46 - 3124.26] container if you want to do that Monica

[3132.84 - 3138.00] what do you feel right now let me know
[3135.36 - 3140.82] how you you know tag on medical medium
[3138.00 - 3142.32] medical medium you know when you do your
[3140.82 - 3143.70] post whatever your real estate stores I
[3142.32 - 3145.56] would love to see them I'd love to
[3143.70 - 3146.94] repost them if I can that would be
[3145.56 - 3149.94] incredible
[3146.94 - 3152.58] and it's best to fresh and not frozen
[3149.94 - 3154.44] and not sitting all day but it's but you
[3152.58 - 3155.58] still if you had to do it that way then
[3154.44 - 3157.38] I understand
[3155.58 - 3159.00] Emily Marshall says we don't need to
[3157.38 - 3161.16] strain the shot then you don't have to
[3159.00 - 3163.88] if you don't want to I I do a little bit
[3161.16 - 3163.88] of a straining
[3164.40 - 3168.42] it's really potent
[3166.08 - 3171.36] it's really powerful
[3168.42 - 3173.22] I love the food for your one
[3171.36 - 3175.62] I get like
[3173.22 - 3178.62] the sensations haven't gone away from me
[3175.62 - 3180.84] they're still there after sending that
[3178.62 - 3183.18] down and I still feel it around the
[3180.84 - 3185.16] brain stem for that one which is really
[3183.18 - 3189.20] incredible
[3185.16 - 3189.20] I had a strainer for my shot
[3189.78 - 3197.22] amazing Pamela Miller says I felt it
[3193.68 - 3200.10] instantly as going down the hatch
[3197.22 - 3203.04] like I the thing is is the brain shot
[3200.10 - 3205.74] therapies that's how I feel it too
[3203.04 - 3208.80] and it puts me in a whole different mode
[3205.74 - 3210.66] a whole different mood it's really
[3208.80 - 3213.90] incredible
[3210.66 - 3216.60] if the be sure says is one brain shot
[3213.90 - 3218.82] enough like a single glass shot it is
[3216.60 - 3221.28] enough indeed because depending on
[3218.82 - 3224.04] ingredients some rain shots created up
[3221.28 - 3226.86] to five glass shots that's okay
[3224.04 - 3228.60] you can use what's left over too and
[3226.86 - 3231.00] make another shot absolutely what's
[3228.60 - 3235.08] going to happen is variations of how
[3231.00 - 3237.24] much how much juice content is in each
[3235.08 - 3239.16] thing you're using is going to kind of
[3237.24 - 3240.60] vary sometimes you get mangoes that are
[3239.16 - 3242.16] not as juicy sometimes you'll get
[3240.60 - 3244.32] spinach just a little bit more drier
[3242.16 - 3246.36] sometimes you'll get an herb that's a
[3244.32 - 3248.82] you know drier with a not a lot of water
[3246.36 - 3251.76] content in its stems and all of that
[3248.82 - 3254.22] plays a role when you're making it and
[3251.76 - 3256.08] that was all accounted for when Spirit
[3254.22 - 3257.70] of compassion was designing the brain
[3256.08 - 3260.22] shot Therapies
[3257.70 - 3263.64] Lisa boxes mm School
[3260.22 - 3266.10] indeed 20 days of it I hope you guys are
[3263.64 - 3267.12] excited as excited as I am and what's to
[3266.10 - 3269.64] come
[3267.12 - 3272.22] Stevie Bella says while doing the shot
[3269.64 - 3274.26] challenge do you recommend that this be
[3272.22 - 3276.84] done at a particular time for instance
[3274.26 - 3278.82] someone has done 20 to 40 ounces of
[3276.84 - 3281.70] lemon water 16 to 20 ounces of celery
[3278.82 - 3283.92] juice is that shot next the book gives
[3281.70 - 3287.70] exact details to that particular
[3283.92 - 3290.46] question that you have it'll it'll spell
[3287.70 - 3292.62] it out for you which is incredible
[3290.46 - 3294.30] but great question
[3292.62 - 3296.16] you guys
[3294.30 - 3297.24] I'm jacked up from that food fear
[3296.16 - 3298.86] shifter
[3297.24 - 3300.72] like
[3298.86 - 3302.88] I'm not afraid to eat a whole cheese
[3300.72 - 3305.82] pizza with sausage on it now and I'm
[3302.88 - 3307.68] kidding I'm not gonna eat that anyway
[3305.82 - 3309.60] but seriously
[3307.68 - 3310.56] it's actually kind of like lightened by
[3309.60 - 3313.08] heart
[3310.56 - 3314.46] I feel it's like it's working my brain
[3313.08 - 3317.28] stem right now
[3314.46 - 3320.28] it's what it's doing I feel like it's in
[3317.28 - 3323.82] here it's radiating around here and then
[3320.28 - 3326.46] I feel a cooling sensation happen from
[3323.82 - 3328.32] here on down which is so weird that's
[3326.46 - 3330.56] how I'm feeling that's what I'm
[3328.32 - 3334.14] experiencing right now
[3330.56 - 3335.52] so that's the experiences I'm having in
[3334.14 - 3337.70] the moment just letting you know you
[3335.52 - 3337.70] guys

[3351.12 - 3353.16] do
[3351.84 - 3355.32] let's go there
[3353.16 - 3358.52] these are big books
[3355.32 - 3358.52] just keep that in mind
[3360.24 - 3367.52] okay 277 food fear section in the Eating
[3364.80 - 3370.08] Disorders chapter in brain saver
[3367.52 - 3371.88] oftentimes an eating disorder develops
[3370.08 - 3374.10] because of a symptom
[3371.88 - 3375.18] I wanted to ask you guys a question how
[3374.10 - 3378.60] many
[3375.18 - 3380.82] how many of you experienced and I'm on
[3378.60 - 3382.50] page 277 right now how many people
[3380.82 - 3383.82] experienced
[3382.50 - 3386.34] where
[3383.82 - 3388.32] a symptom came over you
[3386.34 - 3391.32] you got your first symptom or you got
[3388.32 - 3392.88] sick and then eating disorders what
[3391.32 - 3394.98] feels like eating disorders came
[3392.88 - 3396.72] afterwards
[3394.98 - 3399.66] how many people experience that because
[3396.72 - 3402.06] I know a lot of people experience that
[3399.66 - 3404.28] a symptom related to not being able to
[3402.06 - 3405.66] swallow correctly may be choking nausea
[3404.28 - 3408.84] pain in the stomach a feeling of
[3405.66 - 3411.06] tightness in the throat or chest
[3408.84 - 3413.76] how many people got like
[3411.06 - 3415.92] anxiety disorders
[3413.76 - 3418.62] right a condition where symptoms of
[3415.92 - 3421.08] anxiety and then that
[3418.62 - 3423.48] followed up and eating disorder because
[3421.08 - 3424.74] of the anxiety did that ever happen to
[3423.48 - 3427.74] you I'm saying you're saying I did
[3424.74 - 3429.18] you're saying yes so it's like you got
[3427.74 - 3431.04] it your first symptoms you got your
[3429.18 - 3432.78] first anxiety attacks you got your first
[3431.04 - 3434.28] panic attacks
[3432.78 - 3436.44] and then
[3434.28 - 3438.84] what came with that
[3436.44 - 3441.90] was all of a sudden eating problems
[3438.84 - 3443.70] because you had anxiety it started with
[3441.90 - 3446.46] that or what about a tightness of the
[3443.70 - 3450.00] throat what about a tightness
[3446.46 - 3451.62] of the chest right so maybe you got this
[3450.00 - 3453.60] symptom where it's the tightness of the
[3451.62 - 3455.70] chest tightness of the throat or maybe
[3453.60 - 3457.08] you got a stomach symptom
[3455.70 - 3459.18] did you guys ever have your first
[3457.08 - 3461.58] stomach symptoms where you're like
[3459.18 - 3464.10] serious bloating serious stomach
[3461.58 - 3466.68] symptoms going on
[3464.10 - 3469.20] and then that actually created an eating
[3466.68 - 3471.24] disorder now you don't know what to eat
[3469.20 - 3473.22] because your stomach's all wonky things
[3471.24 - 3476.06] are all strange with your stomach you
[3473.22 - 3476.06] don't know what to eat
[3476.16 - 3481.26] and so then an eating disorder followed
[3479.04 - 3483.30] after the symptom of having stomach
[3481.26 - 3487.46] problems having a throat tightness
[3483.30 - 3487.46] having chest tightness having anxiety
[3487.74 - 3493.98] yes too what about like
[3490.98 - 3496.02] OCD as well and then that follows into
[3493.98 - 3498.30] an eating disorder because of OCD you're
[3496.02 - 3501.06] suffering from or struggling from
[3498.30 - 3502.92] a symptom related to not being able to
[3501.06 - 3504.30] swallow correctly choking nausea pain in
[3502.92 - 3506.58] the stomach or feeling of tightness in
[3504.30 - 3509.46] the throat or chest right and instead of
[3506.58 - 3513.96] the Rope kindness in the chest
[3509.46 - 3515.76] we're losing the sense of taste or smell
[3513.96 - 3518.46] that's another thing that throws people
[3515.76 - 3521.16] into Eating Disorders it's the losing
[3518.46 - 3523.08] the taste or the smell
[3521.16 - 3525.60] this is where someone is living their
[3523.08 - 3528.90] life and they're eating just as anybody
[3525.60 - 3531.96] else would be eating and then these
[3528.90 - 3533.76] symptoms start to develop you're going
[3531.96 - 3535.44] through life you feel like you're just
[3533.76 - 3537.12] normally doing what you're doing
[3535.44 - 3538.98] you're eating what you're eating you're
[3537.12 - 3541.56] eating what everybody else is eating
[3538.98 - 3544.44] everything seems fine and dandy and then
[3541.56 - 3548.36] the symptoms happen
[3544.44 - 3548.36] and now an eating disorder starts
[3548.52 - 3553.56] in some cases if it's a chronic nausea
[3551.22 - 3554.64] for example then Foods become pick and
[3553.56 - 3557.64] choose
[3554.64 - 3559.44] chronic nausea that's a huge one right
[3557.64 - 3563.12] there
[3559.44 - 3563.12] that's a big one actually
[3563.16 - 3567.36] so many people have gone through that
[3565.08 - 3569.76] where it's like you got the chronic
[3567.36 - 3571.98] nausea and then you're in trouble it's a
[3569.76 - 3575.58] game of what's going to help ease my
[3571.98 - 3577.98] nausea what's going to help my nausea
[3575.58 - 3580.20] right Amy has a question over there on
[3577.98 - 3582.54] YouTube or wait just Selena's question
[3580.20 - 3585.42] so grateful so much of my OCD is gone
[3582.54 - 3587.82] thanks to Medical medium
[3585.42 - 3591.30] Amy has a question there on YouTube can
[3587.82 - 3592.64] we do the shots on the 369 cleanse yes
[3591.30 - 3596.10] you can
[3592.64 - 3597.90] yes yes yes question here on YouTube
[3596.10 - 3600.30] Angela
[3597.90 - 3603.42] I feel more energy when I do these brain
[3600.30 - 3606.84] shots and the pathogen exposure shots
[3603.42 - 3608.82] start staved off covet when I sat
[3606.84 - 3611.88] next to co-workers
[3608.82 - 3613.74] got covet at the Holiday party whoa so
[3611.88 - 3617.10] you staved it off incredible the
[3613.74 - 3618.54] pathogen exposure shot that's amazing
[3617.10 - 3621.72] so what happens is when people get
[3618.54 - 3624.66] nausea that really triggers often to
[3621.72 - 3626.70] Boom a Cascade of
[3624.66 - 3628.74] Eating Disorders right
[3626.70 - 3630.54] what's not helping this nausea what's
[3628.74 - 3632.40] helping this nausea what foods do I eat
[3630.54 - 3633.96] because I'm nauseous do any of these
[3632.40 - 3636.18] Foods I'm eating contribute to my aunt
[3633.96 - 3638.04] nausea weight that food made me nauseous
[3636.18 - 3640.02] but it made me nauseous the other day
[3638.04 - 3642.06] it's not making me nauseous today wait
[3640.02 - 3644.70] that food is making me nauseous again
[3642.06 - 3646.74] what is it and that creates the Eating
[3644.70 - 3649.56] Disorders because it's like
[3646.74 - 3651.90] that food was working for me last week
[3649.56 - 3655.04] it was working for me yesterday how come
[3651.90 - 3655.04] it's not working for me today
[3655.62 - 3659.64] what's not helping with this nausea do
[3658.08 - 3662.28] any of these Foods I'm eating contribute
[3659.64 - 3663.72] to it how come when I'm not eating I
[3662.28 - 3664.98] still have the nausea then that's
[3663.72 - 3666.84] another thing too
[3664.98 - 3668.58] then our mind Consciousness starts to
[3666.84 - 3671.40] pick up patterns and habits because of
[3668.58 - 3672.90] small bursts of PTSD developing how many
[3671.40 - 3676.40] guys
[3672.90 - 3676.40] how many people you know
[3676.74 - 3682.98] have PTSD around food
[3679.46 - 3685.98] post-traumatic stress around food and
[3682.98 - 3688.38] eating right
[3685.98 - 3691.92] because at PTSD around food and eating
[3688.38 - 3694.50] can be like in tens
[3691.92 - 3696.12] you eat something and you're nauseous so
[3694.50 - 3697.02] you identify that food is being the
[3696.12 - 3699.84] problem
[3697.02 - 3701.52] she learned to avoid that food
[3699.84 - 3702.96] just as you get comfortable eating
[3701.52 - 3705.18] another food thinking you're safe and
[3702.96 - 3706.62] good you get nauseous again
[3705.18 - 3708.78] so then that's another food you're
[3706.62 - 3710.76] uncomfortable eating suspecting it's
[3708.78 - 3713.40] contributing to your problem this can
[3710.76 - 3714.96] carry on into other Foods as well nausea
[3713.40 - 3717.78] doesn't usually receive a diagnosis
[3714.96 - 3720.66] besides nausea but then we end up with
[3717.78 - 3722.34] an eating disorder
[3720.66 - 3724.02] nausea doesn't usually receive a
[3722.34 - 3725.76] diagnosis besides nausea or maybe
[3724.02 - 3727.92] nervousness or anxiety if everything
[3725.76 - 3730.14] checks out okay in the abdomen it's
[3727.92 - 3733.38] usually passed off as someone being too
[3730.14 - 3735.60] sensitive but then we get the PTSD
[3733.38 - 3739.44] and with that PTSD we end up getting the
[3735.60 - 3741.42] Eating Disorders with that PTSD
[3739.44 - 3743.34] happens to so many people
