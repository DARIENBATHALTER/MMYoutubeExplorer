[248.80 - 254.00] in those snares eventually
[250.80 - 256.00] and eventually get too sick that's
[254.00 - 257.36] how it happens to everyone and maybe
[256.00 - 258.64] you're somebody that's not sick but you
[257.36 - 260.00] just you just care about what you're

[840.08 - 844.16] there's no way in hell
[842.24 - 846.24] caffeine industry and the chocolate
[844.16 - 848.16] industry is a monster
[846.24 - 850.16] and everybody's going to be addicted to
[848.16 - 852.64] that caffeine until they die
[850.16 - 854.32] right maybe not you guys right lorraine
[852.64 - 856.80] l good to see you
[854.32 - 858.08] and so but what happens is it's about
[856.80 - 861.28] since i was young
[858.08 - 862.80] yeah since i was young it was about
[861.28 - 865.36] protecting you guys
[862.80 - 867.36] because they rob and steal any chance
[865.36 - 869.76] for you to heal
[867.36 - 871.60] and they teach you how to fat yourself
[869.76 - 874.64] to death on top of it
[871.60 - 879.12] and then the guessing games are like
[874.64 - 881.76] bullets and they're like knife jabs
[879.12 - 882.56] when you're sick and even when you're
[881.76 - 885.68] not
[882.56 - 886.72] you know so um no caffeine and chocolate
[885.68 - 888.48] for 60 days
[886.72 - 890.00] that's really really really cool right
[888.48 - 891.28] there on tick tock
[890.00 - 893.04] you guys i'm holding this book because
[891.28 - 895.76] this is the new edition right here
[893.04 - 898.08] and well anthony what are you selling
[895.76 - 898.32] what are you selling aw liz good to see
[898.08 - 899.84] you
[898.32 - 902.00] death by a thousand cuts what are you
[899.84 - 903.44] selling anthony you can get the books
[902.00 - 905.04] free at the library
[903.44 - 906.40] just get it free the library if you want
[905.04 - 907.36] yeah you can get it on amazon or a
[906.40 - 908.56] bookstore or whatever
[907.36 - 910.56] and you know what it does it pays for
[908.56 - 912.88] making the book yeah
[910.56 - 914.16] pays for all the everything to go to
[912.88 - 915.44] actually printing the book
[914.16 - 918.40] when you buy it off of something but get
[915.44 - 921.28] it free at the library the free library
[918.40 - 922.24] um i'm making the the problem is with
[921.28 - 923.92] with like
[922.24 - 926.00] like coffee and all the different
[923.92 - 929.36] caffeines you got is a psychoactive
[926.00 - 931.92] drug gotta keep that in mind right and
[929.36 - 932.56] i know it takes the innocence out of it
[931.92 - 935.76] i know
[932.56 - 936.16] chocolate is so innocent in so many ways
[935.76 - 938.00] right
[936.16 - 940.00] it takes the innocence out of that but
[938.00 - 941.36] chocolate's got the caffeine in there so
[940.00 - 944.64] it's a psychoactive drug
[941.36 - 947.60] and if you're gonna heal if you want to
[944.64 - 950.64] heal it will get in the way that's all
[947.60 - 951.36] it maybe not one time here and there but
[950.64 - 953.76] it will
[951.36 - 955.92] get in the way and there's no holding
[953.76 - 957.12] back because that addiction is strong
[955.92 - 958.48] right that's why everybody's on their
[957.12 - 959.76] chocolate every week they're on their
[958.48 - 960.80] chocolate smoothies they're throwing
[959.76 - 962.08] chocolate and everything right on
[960.80 - 963.92] tick-tock you guys
[962.08 - 965.44] chocolates in everything yeah i saw
[963.92 - 967.12] matcha yeah matcha the same thing the
[965.44 - 969.56] caffeine right
[967.12 - 971.92] and what happens is like the whole
[969.56 - 972.64] osteopenia thing that's from all that
[971.92 - 975.68] caffeine
[972.64 - 977.52] osteopenia osteoporosis the caffeine
[975.68 - 980.24] takes you down that road
[977.52 - 980.96] right so look i could hold a blind eye
[980.24 - 982.88] to it all
[980.96 - 984.64] i could sit back pretend it's not
[982.88 - 986.48] happening we can do that
[984.64 - 988.40] we can sit back we can pretend it's not
[986.48 - 989.68] happening we can pretend
[988.40 - 991.20] nothing's happening how about that
[989.68 - 991.84] nothing's happening you guys how about
[991.20 - 993.20] that
[991.84 - 994.88] right how's that sound does that sound
[993.20 - 997.36] good wanna do that
[994.88 - 998.40] when uh people say raw chocolate is good
[997.36 - 1001.60] but like you said
[998.40 - 1004.32] it's all bad well that's how it is
[1001.60 - 1005.92] you know the drug dealers they'll say
[1004.32 - 1008.64] they'll say chocolate's good
[1005.92 - 1010.40] the drug dealers yeah because in the end
[1008.64 - 1011.60] that's what it is it's a psychoactive
[1010.40 - 1014.80] drug right
[1011.60 - 1016.88] so it's really addicting and
[1014.80 - 1018.48] lorraine else said chocolate is so hard
[1016.88 - 1021.60] to let go
[1018.48 - 1023.28] it is right cacao powder is smoothies
[1021.60 - 1025.68] too yeah that's that's all
[1023.28 - 1027.68] that's to brainwash you guys i'm trying
[1025.68 - 1030.72] to un-brainwash
[1027.68 - 1032.24] you right they got you brainwashed i can
[1030.72 - 1032.88] go into all the different levels of
[1032.24 - 1034.56] brainwash
[1032.88 - 1036.00] protein protein protein protein powders
[1034.56 - 1037.28] protein fat your brain wash
[1036.00 - 1038.56] um chocolate chocolate chocolate
[1037.28 - 1040.40] chocolate smoothies chocolate in your
[1038.56 - 1042.80] smoothies cacao cacao
[1040.40 - 1044.88] what happens is they train us to become
[1042.80 - 1046.88] high chasers you guys on tick tock
[1044.88 - 1048.00] they train us to become high chasers
[1046.88 - 1049.68] chasing that high
[1048.00 - 1051.28] gotta chase that high i'm gonna chase
[1049.68 - 1053.20] that high i gotta keep on chasing that
[1051.28 - 1056.32] high that's what it is
[1053.20 - 1058.08] we become high chasers and they teach us
[1056.32 - 1060.56] that young and then the alternate
[1058.08 - 1063.52] movement takes it on
[1060.56 - 1065.28] because they're drug dealers too and you
[1063.52 - 1067.76] know but look look
[1065.28 - 1068.64] pretend it's all it doesn't exist none
[1067.76 - 1071.84] of it exists
[1068.64 - 1073.44] who cares play the guessing games don't
[1071.84 - 1074.88] don't drink your celery juice because
[1073.44 - 1076.72] it's so bad for you like
[1074.88 - 1078.32] you know like the industry tries to
[1076.72 - 1080.00] basically trick out
[1078.32 - 1081.68] trick out everybody and they put hits
[1080.00 - 1082.00] out there to try to stop celery juice
[1081.68 - 1084.40] right
[1082.00 - 1085.84] just don't do anything good for yourself
[1084.40 - 1087.60] exactly right
[1085.84 - 1088.72] don't do anything good for yourselves i
[1087.60 - 1090.56] just saw a whole bunch of people got
[1088.72 - 1091.84] kicked off of facebook just now
[1090.56 - 1094.80] so i just saw a whole bunch of people
[1091.84 - 1096.64] got booted and it's like don't do
[1094.80 - 1099.52] anything
[1096.64 - 1101.20] for yourself protecting yourself right
[1099.52 - 1103.20] don't know about these pitfalls don't
[1101.20 - 1104.08] know about these snares don't know about
[1103.20 - 1107.44] these
[1104.08 - 1110.48] these problems and then we live our life
[1107.44 - 1111.28] and we get beaten down without us
[1110.48 - 1112.64] knowing
[1111.28 - 1114.16] right i mean that's what happens
[1112.64 - 1115.68] freezing on facebook it's freezing on
[1114.16 - 1116.48] facebook because facebook's freezing it
[1115.68 - 1118.48] out
[1116.48 - 1119.92] um that's how they try to drop out 200
[1118.48 - 1123.44] 300 people at a time
[1119.92 - 1125.92] 400 people 500 people at a time um

[1137.68 - 1141.28] they censor it right don't show it to
[1140.16 - 1144.48] everybody
[1141.28 - 1146.88] but that's a whole thing you know

[1201.60 - 1204.88] do you want me to do that now i could
[1202.80 - 1208.00] worry about myself 24 7.
[1204.88 - 1209.60] i could get into myself 24 7. just what
[1208.00 - 1211.60] what is what does aw
[1209.60 - 1213.84] need to do let's do aws life the whole
[1211.60 - 1215.60] thing and all that stuff and
[1213.84 - 1217.68] but you know that's just not that's not
[1215.60 - 1220.64] good it's like i got to make sure
[1217.68 - 1222.16] i got you back in a whole bit um look if
[1220.64 - 1222.48] you're on facebook and you got booted
[1222.16 - 1223.84] off

[1232.48 - 1235.92] here too you guys
[1234.24 - 1237.68] so the bottom line is that's a pretty
[1235.92 - 1239.36] harsh thing for me to say
[1237.68 - 1240.72] right they rob and steal any chance for
[1239.36 - 1243.12] you to heal
[1240.72 - 1245.36] even if they don't know what they do
[1243.12 - 1247.92] even if they do not know what they do
[1245.36 - 1250.16] right you know not what they do right
[1247.92 - 1253.36] even if that's a situation
[1250.16 - 1256.96] but the bottom line is how
[1253.36 - 1260.32] can i protect everyone the best they can
[1256.96 - 1263.92] right and at the same time
[1260.32 - 1266.32] you guys learn how to protect yourselves
[1263.92 - 1268.00] so you become your health expert like
[1266.32 - 1270.24] that's what it's always been about
[1268.00 - 1271.76] you becoming a health expert your own
[1270.24 - 1274.40] health expert
[1271.76 - 1275.84] right so that's the key you're back good

[1285.12 - 1290.00] we live in a place where it is like
[1288.40 - 1291.92] been thinking about the matrix a lot
[1290.00 - 1292.80] right and it's just a fun fun thing to
[1291.92 - 1294.32] think about
[1292.80 - 1296.32] a lot of people really they're they're
[1294.32 - 1297.28] they really believe in that matrix right
[1296.32 - 1300.56] a lot of people do
[1297.28 - 1303.84] right and it's a pretty cool concept
[1300.56 - 1306.88] it's a pretty cool theory but there
[1303.84 - 1310.00] kind of really is a matrix going around
[1306.88 - 1312.16] in the world of health there really is
[1310.00 - 1313.12] and it's this place where there's so
[1312.16 - 1315.04] many things
[1313.12 - 1316.80] holding us back in it that we don't
[1315.04 - 1318.40] realize that are happening
[1316.80 - 1320.40] and then we get brainwashed in the
[1318.40 - 1322.56] process right the protein deal
[1320.40 - 1324.72] that brainwashed us that that totally
[1322.56 - 1326.00] gave us the big brainwash in 1933. i
[1324.72 - 1327.92] talked about that you guys
[1326.00 - 1329.28] where it was to convince everybody that
[1327.92 - 1332.88] protein means
[1329.28 - 1335.76] everything it just means everything okay
[1332.88 - 1338.16] and that that's been ingrained ingrained
[1335.76 - 1339.92] in our psyche that's a big brainwashed
[1338.16 - 1343.28] out alone all on its own
[1339.92 - 1344.08] right and so it's like a mob is what it
[1343.28 - 1346.24] is
[1344.08 - 1348.48] and then science of research they're
[1346.24 - 1348.88] part of that mob because they're a paid
[1348.48 - 1351.76] for
[1348.88 - 1353.44] mob in health right and they confuse us
[1351.76 - 1356.72] because it's like this it's like
[1353.44 - 1358.24] two plus two equals four jet fuel is
[1356.72 - 1360.72] comprised of
[1358.24 - 1362.16] this code it's pro it's comprised of
[1360.72 - 1365.52] this math
[1362.16 - 1367.84] you know it's it jet fuel is fossil fuel
[1365.52 - 1369.28] you know what they do is they actually
[1367.84 - 1371.44] synthesize it they actually
[1369.28 - 1373.60] work it right they have all the science
[1371.44 - 1374.40] so that so that literally you can have a
[1373.60 - 1377.52] jet fly
[1374.40 - 1379.44] right and there's all that but then so
[1377.52 - 1381.92] we think well science knows everything
[1379.44 - 1383.52] see that jet fly across the sky right
[1381.92 - 1384.64] look i can call my friend right now on
[1383.52 - 1387.04] my phone whatever
[1384.64 - 1388.64] that's science science has it all down
[1387.04 - 1391.76] and so we're convinced
[1388.64 - 1393.92] that science has it all down in
[1391.76 - 1395.92] in health especially with the surgeries
[1393.92 - 1397.68] you need a heart valve replacement right
[1395.92 - 1400.16] we can do it now
[1397.68 - 1401.68] we can do it and that's what's
[1400.16 - 1404.24] incredible out there right
[1401.68 - 1405.60] so we can we get convinced that science
[1404.24 - 1407.12] has it all down
[1405.60 - 1409.68] but when it comes down to chronic
[1407.12 - 1413.68] illness it's far from the truth
[1409.68 - 1417.20] and then that leads us into like a whole
[1413.68 - 1420.72] you know chasing chasing chasing highs
[1417.20 - 1422.96] chasing uh dreams chasing everything
[1420.72 - 1425.04] we're chasing those science and research
[1422.96 - 1426.64] smoke and mirrors the smoke and the
[1425.04 - 1428.24] mirrors we're in this one mirror room
[1426.64 - 1429.76] and then one smoke room in one mirror
[1428.24 - 1431.76] room and that's what we're chasing
[1429.76 - 1432.80] but the bottom line is how can we
[1431.76 - 1434.88] protect you guys
[1432.80 - 1435.84] how can we give you guys answers so you
[1434.88 - 1437.76] know why you're sick
[1435.84 - 1439.36] and how can we give you the tools and
[1437.76 - 1440.48] what to avoid when you think about it
[1439.36 - 1441.60] that's everything
[1440.48 - 1442.88] that's everything i'm gonna start making
[1441.60 - 1444.00] some fries and we're gonna talk about
[1442.88 - 1447.28] some cool stuff
[1444.00 - 1448.64] we're live on youtube facebook clubhouse
[1447.28 - 1450.72] and tick tock i'm going to put this down
[1448.64 - 1454.32] for a second
[1450.72 - 1455.52] so um i have steamed potatoes i'm taking
[1454.32 - 1456.88] them out right now i'm going to cut some
[1455.52 - 1458.32] fries i'm going to get them in the oven
[1456.88 - 1461.76] and we're gonna make the ketchup
[1458.32 - 1464.80] how about that so
[1461.76 - 1466.56] i got some potatoes over here springing
[1464.80 - 1469.04] them over
[1466.56 - 1470.96] so these are steamed potatoes you can do
[1469.04 - 1471.36] this without them being steamed but you
[1470.96 - 1473.92] gotta
[1471.36 - 1475.04] you know you gotta keep the lower heat
[1473.92 - 1477.28] on the oven
[1475.04 - 1478.80] so you're really baking the potato fries
[1477.28 - 1480.48] right but i like them steamed so i could
[1478.80 - 1483.92] put them in have the oven hot
[1480.48 - 1486.00] make the fries really good aw thanks uh
[1483.92 - 1487.68] savita says aw i am so grateful
[1486.00 - 1489.44] for giving me my life back your
[1487.68 - 1490.56] information saved me i mean that's what
[1489.44 - 1494.08] matters
[1490.56 - 1497.04] never heard that ever ever heard that
[1494.08 - 1498.80] in the other in the other uh parts of
[1497.04 - 1499.36] the alternative medicine world by the
[1498.80 - 1503.04] way
[1499.36 - 1505.92] years gone by if one practitioner
[1503.04 - 1506.88] back in the 2000s early 2000s one
[1505.92 - 1510.16] practitioner got
[1506.88 - 1510.80] one person better it was a miracle
[1510.16 - 1514.40] they'd be
[1510.80 - 1515.92] heralded as like a god that's what
[1514.40 - 1517.76] happened back then right
[1515.92 - 1519.68] now we're in a place where you know
[1517.76 - 1522.40] we've learned about so much information
[1519.68 - 1524.32] now for medical medium it's spread out
[1522.40 - 1526.40] so people are healing a little bit more
[1524.32 - 1528.48] like why to stay away from gluten it's
[1526.40 - 1530.40] 35 years of mm work
[1528.48 - 1531.68] why to stay away from this back in the
[1530.40 - 1532.96] old days of the health movement it was
[1531.68 - 1534.48] just about stay away from processed
[1532.96 - 1536.24] foods that's all
[1534.48 - 1537.84] processed foods right i'm going to put
[1536.24 - 1538.64] some fries on here i'm cutting some
[1537.84 - 1541.28] fries
[1538.64 - 1542.88] as we speak i got some potatoes here it
[1541.28 - 1545.76] was all about
[1542.88 - 1546.64] back in the old day in alternative
[1545.76 - 1548.88] medicine
[1546.64 - 1550.48] it was all about just stay away from
[1548.88 - 1555.52] processed foods
[1550.48 - 1558.40] that's all boxed foods boxed cereals
[1555.52 - 1559.68] sugar cereals right it was all about
[1558.40 - 1562.72] stay away from
[1559.68 - 1564.64] all that it was there was
[1562.72 - 1566.56] nothing else nothing else in the health
[1564.64 - 1568.88] scene nothing else
[1566.56 - 1570.08] that's all it was i mean think about how
[1568.88 - 1573.84] incredible that is right
[1570.08 - 1577.20] it was just about that um
[1573.84 - 1580.64] so i'm making some fries right here
[1577.20 - 1581.60] and there are thousands of healing
[1580.64 - 1583.20] stories
[1581.60 - 1585.12] with the medical medium information
[1583.20 - 1586.88] someone's gonna say of course well aw
[1585.12 - 1588.56] you're you're gonna be tooting your own
[1586.88 - 1590.32] horn about
[1588.56 - 1591.84] medical medium information why wouldn't
[1590.32 - 1592.88] you because you're a medical medium it's
[1591.84 - 1595.20] like
[1592.88 - 1598.40] i'm not tooting my horn i'm tooting the
[1595.20 - 1599.76] horn of spirit of compassion because the
[1598.40 - 1601.92] information came from spirit of
[1599.76 - 1602.40] compassion so what i'm doing is i'm i'm
[1601.92 - 1604.16] just
[1602.40 - 1606.00] i'm happy it's been working all these
[1604.16 - 1609.04] years
[1606.00 - 1610.40] so that's what it is you know i'm happy
[1609.04 - 1613.84] it's been working all these years so i
[1610.40 - 1613.84] got some fries going on here
[1617.44 - 1619.68] um
[1620.88 - 1624.80] so what you do is you take the potato
[1623.84 - 1626.48] and
[1624.80 - 1628.16] these are still hot so they're a little
[1626.48 - 1630.48] sticky right
[1628.16 - 1631.84] take the potato and you can do it a
[1630.48 - 1632.32] couple different ways you can do it like
[1631.84 - 1635.60] this
[1632.32 - 1635.60] just cutting these fries like that
[1636.56 - 1640.00] these are a little bit more of the steak
[1638.40 - 1641.52] fries and then you can cut the other
[1640.00 - 1642.72] fries where they're not steak fries so
[1641.52 - 1644.96] that's like a steak fry
[1642.72 - 1646.16] a lot of people like those better that's
[1644.96 - 1648.00] what i've noticed over the years they
[1646.16 - 1649.28] like the steak fries right
[1648.00 - 1651.44] you know it's kind of like there's
[1649.28 - 1652.96] there's more meat to them so that's what
[1651.44 - 1655.84] people like i'm just putting them on
[1652.96 - 1655.84] on the pan right here
[1658.00 - 1661.20] so i'm just dropping these on the pan as
[1659.60 - 1662.64] you guys can see on tick tock that's
[1661.20 - 1664.16] what i'm doing clubhouse that's what i'm
[1662.64 - 1669.36] doing
[1664.16 - 1672.16] and we got some good stuff to talk about
[1669.36 - 1674.72] so what have you been taught to do
[1672.16 - 1677.44] throughout the years you guys
[1674.72 - 1680.80] you've been taught to do the bone broth
[1677.44 - 1680.80] which has the vinegar in it
[1680.88 - 1684.88] i call the bone broth the fat broth
[1683.44 - 1689.36] that's what it is
[1684.88 - 1693.04] it's the fat broth and
[1689.36 - 1694.16] that's a hard one it's it's it's hard to
[1693.04 - 1697.04] heal
[1694.16 - 1699.12] when you're doing the bone broth because
[1697.04 - 1701.68] that pancreas and that liver of yours
[1699.12 - 1703.44] is under so much stress when you're
[1701.68 - 1705.84] doing bone broth
[1703.44 - 1707.84] you know and but yeah you'll you know
[1705.84 - 1709.68] people like oh this is how people
[1707.84 - 1712.24] you know can get better it's like oh it
[1709.68 - 1714.64] is it it's not
[1712.24 - 1716.24] it's not the thing is with bone broth is
[1714.64 - 1719.04] if you're choosing not to eat anything
[1716.24 - 1721.76] else and you're just doing bone broth
[1719.04 - 1722.96] you're you're now basically doing a mono
[1721.76 - 1724.88] diet for the moment
[1722.96 - 1727.28] and yeah you might see some benefits in
[1724.88 - 1729.52] the moment but in the end it's not
[1727.28 - 1731.92] the way to go because you'll see more
[1729.52 - 1733.52] fallbacks over time
[1731.92 - 1736.32] the whole vinegar thing in the bone
[1733.52 - 1737.04] broth is really really not a good idea
[1736.32 - 1741.28] too
[1737.04 - 1743.76] vinegar is is such a health destroyer
[1741.28 - 1747.04] and the reason why some people feel like
[1743.76 - 1750.08] they get a boost from bone broth
[1747.04 - 1752.40] is because of the steroids involved
[1750.08 - 1754.16] so you get faked out so a lot of
[1752.40 - 1756.64] alternative medicine
[1754.16 - 1758.00] is a fake out just so you know so i'm
[1756.64 - 1760.64] putting some fries on this
[1758.00 - 1763.44] on this sheet here a lot of alternative
[1760.64 - 1767.84] medicine is a fake out
[1763.44 - 1771.12] so what happens is that when the cow
[1767.84 - 1773.20] is gone to slaughter right
[1771.12 - 1775.12] doesn't matter if you say well no our
[1773.20 - 1776.00] practices of how we kill our cows is
[1775.12 - 1779.12] different
[1776.00 - 1781.04] we don't terrify the cows we don't
[1779.12 - 1782.80] we don't walk them through that moment
[1781.04 - 1783.84] of death this isn't an anti-animal
[1782.80 - 1786.48] protein campaign
[1783.84 - 1788.24] i'm i i support animal protein people
[1786.48 - 1789.84] and i support plant-based people so i
[1788.24 - 1791.28] just need that disclaimer out front
[1789.84 - 1793.28] right now for you guys
[1791.28 - 1795.36] so it's just important to know but i get
[1793.28 - 1799.28] it there's there's practices
[1795.36 - 1801.60] where we we don't walk the cow corral it
[1799.28 - 1803.84] to the to the you know slaughterhouse
[1801.60 - 1806.40] right and the cows are all freaking out
[1803.84 - 1808.00] right we we have practices it's like
[1806.40 - 1809.52] nice cow we're petting the cow or
[1808.00 - 1811.12] petting the cow and then we hit the cow
[1809.52 - 1813.52] on the back of the head
[1811.12 - 1814.64] okay so we got these practices where
[1813.52 - 1816.32] it's more humane
[1814.64 - 1818.64] right i've heard that from a lot of
[1816.32 - 1820.08] different um from a lot of different
[1818.64 - 1822.32] industries with it all right
[1820.08 - 1824.24] but the deal is is with that is no
[1822.32 - 1828.08] matter what the adrenals still
[1824.24 - 1831.76] explode so when you kill the cow
[1828.08 - 1833.28] the cow's adrenals explode so the whole
[1831.76 - 1835.36] all the information of the cow's
[1833.28 - 1838.00] adrenals draining
[1835.36 - 1838.56] all that all that epinephrine into the
[1838.00 - 1840.08] body
[1838.56 - 1842.00] this medical medium information
[1840.08 - 1842.88] originally i taught that for years and
[1842.00 - 1846.40] years
[1842.88 - 1847.52] right and where that adrenaline goes i
[1846.40 - 1851.20] mean we're talking about
[1847.52 - 1854.48] huge adrenals cal adrenals are huge
[1851.20 - 1858.32] where that adrenaline goes is inside the
[1854.48 - 1861.44] bones not just inside the meat
[1858.32 - 1864.56] inside the bones okay
[1861.44 - 1867.12] so when you're doing the bone broth
[1864.56 - 1868.64] a big part of that adrenaline surge goes
[1867.12 - 1873.04] inside the bones
[1868.64 - 1875.36] more so than even the meat okay
[1873.04 - 1877.68] and so when you're doing your bone broth
[1875.36 - 1880.24] you're getting a steroid high
[1877.68 - 1881.52] we're high chasing again we're high
[1880.24 - 1883.92] chasing again
[1881.52 - 1885.36] and high chasing is an important
[1883.92 - 1887.20] understanding
[1885.36 - 1888.80] because they rob and steal any chance
[1887.20 - 1891.12] for you to heal
[1888.80 - 1892.56] and puts you on a high chase on top of
[1891.12 - 1894.56] it
[1892.56 - 1895.84] so now you're having your bone broth you
[1894.56 - 1897.68] look at this bone broth it's good this
[1895.84 - 1898.72] bone broth is good i'm having it i'm
[1897.68 - 1903.28] having it
[1898.72 - 1905.52] and you're getting this steroidal effect
[1903.28 - 1907.60] the steroid high is what you're getting
[1905.52 - 1911.68] that's how it works
[1907.60 - 1913.68] and no one's gonna know that
[1911.68 - 1915.44] no one's gonna know that chris linnell
[1913.68 - 1919.04] went to a health practitioner
[1915.44 - 1922.08] and get more sick since one year
[1919.04 - 1924.48] read all your books eat

[1928.16 - 1930.80] better and stronger and younger every
[1930.32 - 1933.04] day

[1946.80 - 1952.08] matter you guys does it
[1949.68 - 1955.04] because the industry that robs and
[1952.08 - 1956.72] steals any chance for you to heal
[1955.04 - 1958.64] doesn't care if you get your life back
[1956.72 - 1961.68] because guess what you rely
[1958.64 - 1964.24] less on the industry you rely
[1961.68 - 1966.16] less on the industry is what happens
[1964.24 - 1967.76] health with liz
[1966.16 - 1969.52] good to see you see you on tick tock
[1967.76 - 1972.56] right now because
[1969.52 - 1975.60] i think you got booted off of
[1972.56 - 1976.08] put it off of facebook do your books
[1975.60 - 1979.12] address
[1976.08 - 1981.44] balancing female hormones
[1979.12 - 1983.20] yeah they do because what happens is if
[1981.44 - 1985.12] you don't get your adrenal strong
[1983.20 - 1986.64] like medical medium adrenal snacks right
[1985.12 - 1988.32] all that information there
[1986.64 - 1990.48] if you don't get your adrenal strong how
[1988.32 - 1993.60] are you ever going to balance your
[1990.48 - 1995.76] your hormones how's it gonna be possible
[1993.60 - 1997.36] you can't balance female female hormones
[1995.76 - 1998.96] unless your adrenals are up to par you
[1997.36 - 2001.44] know why because once you lose that
[1998.96 - 2004.48] hormone blend in your adrenals
[2001.44 - 2006.48] your hair falls out as a woman and
[2004.48 - 2007.68] caffeine is a big part of that a big
[2006.48 - 2011.20] part of that one
[2007.68 - 2013.92] big part of that and so
[2011.20 - 2015.68] if you don't if you don't address your
[2013.92 - 2017.44] adrenals
[2015.68 - 2019.04] then your reproductive hormones that's
[2017.44 - 2023.36] part of your reproductive hormones
[2019.04 - 2025.76] your estrogen it's your adrenals
[2023.36 - 2026.48] so um yeah i addressed that in medical
[2025.76 - 2029.92] medium
[2026.48 - 2031.60] new addition and cleanse the heal
[2029.92 - 2033.76] so that's fun to heal right there it's a
[2031.60 - 2034.96] new addition okay that's cleansed appeal
[2033.76 - 2037.36] and that's the new addition to medical
[2034.96 - 2037.36] medium
[2038.96 - 2043.36] if so what happens is you're having your
[2041.44 - 2045.44] bone broth someone recommended it
[2043.36 - 2048.00] practitioner recommended it right you
[2045.44 - 2051.36] got your bone broth going
[2048.00 - 2051.36] you're noticing you're getting a boost
[2052.48 - 2055.12] that boost
[2055.84 - 2060.56] is because you're getting a steroid high
[2059.12 - 2063.60] you're getting a big boost of
[2060.56 - 2066.24] epinephrine okay
[2063.60 - 2066.72] and it can actually even numb out some
[2066.24 - 2068.80] pain
[2066.72 - 2069.76] temporarily for the moment and then it
[2068.80 - 2071.68] comes back
[2069.76 - 2074.64] but like any addiction because then you
[2071.68 - 2076.08] get addicted to the cow's epinephrine
[2074.64 - 2078.24] you get addicted to the cow's
[2076.08 - 2080.56] epinephrine think about that
[2078.24 - 2082.08] and now you're on this up and down thing
[2080.56 - 2083.92] once again high chasing
[2082.08 - 2085.52] just like coffee up you're up you're
[2083.92 - 2087.12] down you're up you're down
[2085.52 - 2088.64] matcha tea you're up you're down green
[2087.12 - 2091.76] tea you're up you're down
[2088.64 - 2092.96] right you're up you're down that's how
[2091.76 - 2095.12] it works chocolate you're up and down
[2092.96 - 2098.00] you're up and down you're up and down
[2095.12 - 2099.12] okay but what happens is you're doing
[2098.00 - 2102.08] the bone broth
[2099.12 - 2103.60] and you're up you're down you're up
[2102.08 - 2105.60] you're down
[2103.60 - 2106.88] and all of this stuff robs your adrenals
[2105.60 - 2108.00] eventually because you're up you're down
[2106.88 - 2109.20] you're up and down
[2108.00 - 2110.80] we're taught to high chase with
[2109.20 - 2111.92] everything which constantly it's high
[2110.80 - 2114.72] chasing
[2111.92 - 2116.00] right and then the fat high chasing is
[2114.72 - 2119.04] another one too
[2116.00 - 2120.72] we get a high from all the fats just so
[2119.04 - 2123.76] you know

[2264.64 - 2270.64] that you're gonna do it anyway
[2266.72 - 2271.68] i have to go so far over to protect you
[2270.64 - 2274.96] guys
[2271.68 - 2277.36] so that you guys will even think
[2274.96 - 2278.40] about it for a little bit right meaning
[2277.36 - 2280.24] i have to say
[2278.40 - 2281.92] i have to tell you guys cautious of nut
[2280.24 - 2284.48] butters right
[2281.92 - 2286.64] the almond butter the peanut butter the
[2284.48 - 2288.00] walnuts the pumpkin seeds the sunflower
[2286.64 - 2290.16] seeds the hemp seeds
[2288.00 - 2292.16] the oils the coconut oil the olive oil

[3201.84 - 3205.76] dosing too exactly
[3203.20 - 3207.12] the whole micro dosing scam i call it a
[3205.76 - 3209.20] scam
[3207.12 - 3211.28] you know and that's what it is i know
[3209.20 - 3212.56] this pisses off everybody all the stuff

[3270.08 - 3274.08] real poke in your gut where there's a
[3273.04 - 3275.44] hole through it
[3274.08 - 3277.68] and then when you have a hole through it
[3275.44 - 3282.72] guess where you end up you end up in
[3277.68 - 3285.84] icu with 105 temperature with sepsis
[3282.72 - 3287.04] so the leaky gut theory was all wrong to
[3285.84 - 3289.04] begin with
[3287.04 - 3290.64] that was the whole thing no one knew why
[3289.04 - 3292.56] anybody was sick so it was like leaky
[3290.64 - 3294.48] gut leaky gut leaky gut are you kidding
[3292.56 - 3298.00] me if you have leaky gut you'd be like
[3294.48 - 3301.52] sepsis you'd be pissing out blood
[3298.00 - 3304.00] and dying if you have leaky gut fast too
[3301.52 - 3304.72] real fast within a week if you have
[3304.00 - 3306.96] leaky gut
[3304.72 - 3308.88] see how the misinformation works this is
[3306.96 - 3312.72] how the misinformation works
[3308.88 - 3315.28] it's just it's it's rampant it's rampant
[3312.72 - 3317.28] the one thing i can tell you right now
[3315.28 - 3318.72] if you can get past the whole spirit of
[3317.28 - 3321.60] compassion thing
[3318.72 - 3323.36] you will find the answers here okay if
[3321.60 - 3325.52] you can get past
[3323.36 - 3327.36] the whole spirit of compassion like the
[3325.52 - 3330.96] dude hears a voice since
[3327.36 - 3333.92] age four if you can get past that
[3330.96 - 3336.56] if you can just get past that somehow
[3333.92 - 3339.04] you'll have the answers you need
[3336.56 - 3340.00] and you'll be unstoppable it's just you
[3339.04 - 3341.52] you've got to get pat
[3340.00 - 3343.04] that's a thing too like because there's
[3341.52 - 3344.96] so much spiritual racism
[3343.04 - 3346.32] against me tremendous amounts of
[3344.96 - 3349.60] spiritual racism
[3346.32 - 3351.52] like the spiritual racists are the worst

[3351.52 - 3356.96] discriminators they're spiritual racists

[3714.80 - 3718.48] information as if they know things
[3716.40 - 3720.08] meanwhile nobody knows how they just
[3718.48 - 3721.76] they pass it off as oh those are just
[3720.08 - 3725.04] spoils of war who cares if
[3721.76 - 3728.16] 10 000 women got so sick from
[3725.04 - 3730.32] my stupid mistakes susie said i thought
[3728.16 - 3731.92] i read information from a podcast doctor

[3747.20 - 3751.28] guys i'm making a little salad here this
[3749.20 - 3752.80] is green leaf lettuce
[3751.28 - 3754.08] you guys in clubhouse i'm chopping up
[3752.80 - 3755.28] some green leaf lettuce i'm honored
[3754.08 - 3756.64] you're here in clubhouse you guys
[3755.28 - 3758.64] because i know you guys
[3756.64 - 3761.44] are probably on the run running around
[3758.64 - 3763.84] you got your phone on
[3761.44 - 3765.68] we got tick tock live we got facebook
[3763.84 - 3767.76] live eachother is healing
[3765.68 - 3768.88] children what's going on chode is
[3767.76 - 3771.36] amazing um
[3768.88 - 3772.16] the problem is that they take bits and
[3771.36 - 3774.96] pieces
[3772.16 - 3776.64] and then twist it into other things so
[3774.96 - 3778.00] really people aren't getting the truth
[3776.64 - 3779.04] and here's what's interesting to you but
[3778.00 - 3780.72] at the same time
[3779.04 - 3782.72] people are getting they're being
[3780.72 - 3784.24] sustained with their sickness because
[3782.72 - 3784.88] they're using medical media bits and
[3784.24 - 3786.56] pieces
[3784.88 - 3787.92] so they're getting they are getting up
[3786.56 - 3790.16] ticks say
[3787.92 - 3791.76] but yet yeah they're getting up ticks
[3790.16 - 3792.16] and if they're not really sick they get
[3791.76 - 3793.84] a big
[3792.16 - 3795.20] uptick using a medical medium piece of
[3793.84 - 3797.52] information right
[3795.20 - 3798.40] but then the rest isn't there in case
[3797.52 - 3800.40] someone's
[3798.40 - 3802.16] you know sicker and they can't make it
[3800.40 - 3803.60] all the way right
[3802.16 - 3805.92] i don't know if that made sense i was
[3803.60 - 3809.04] trying to make sense on that
[3805.92 - 3810.56] but we're live you know we're live
[3809.04 - 3812.08] so i'm making some salad i got a little
[3810.56 - 3815.68] cilantro in here too
[3812.08 - 3815.68] i'm chopping up um
[3816.48 - 3820.40] i don't like the pre-record stuff unless
[3818.88 - 3822.72] i really have to
[3820.40 - 3824.16] you guys like i like to keep it live all
[3822.72 - 3826.40] the time i don't know if you guys notice
[3824.16 - 3826.40] that
[3833.36 - 3836.80] and it goes back for many years i was
[3835.20 - 3838.64] working so hard teaching so many
[3836.80 - 3841.12] practitioners and doctors
[3838.64 - 3842.56] uh about health and patients that became
[3841.12 - 3844.72] doctors that they started working on
[3842.56 - 3846.64] their platforms before mine
[3844.72 - 3848.32] um out there too and they started
[3846.64 - 3849.84] writing books before i got a chance to
[3848.32 - 3852.32] put the books out so
[3849.84 - 3853.76] little tidbits got out escaped every now
[3852.32 - 3857.20] and then like that too
[3853.76 - 3857.20] not a whole lot but a little
[3858.08 - 3861.60] a decent amount actually so i'm going to
[3859.84 - 3863.44] do some tomatoes right here
[3861.60 - 3866.40] back to that whole thing tomatoes
[3863.44 - 3869.84] causing leaky gut that's really a sad
[3866.40 - 3873.84] misconception a tomato can't cause
[3869.84 - 3877.28] a leaky gut doctors don't even know what
[3873.84 - 3877.28] leaky gut means really
[3878.84 - 3883.28] so let's check those fries hold on you

[3884.80 - 3888.32] this fries going up
[3886.72 - 3890.80] cook it up then you cook a little bit
[3888.32 - 3892.80] more i'm going to turn the heat up now
[3890.80 - 3894.56] to it's 350 but i'm going to put the
[3892.80 - 3898.16] heat up a little bit higher you guys
[3894.56 - 3902.56] so i'm going to dip let's go to 375.
[3898.16 - 3904.40] let's do that okay nice
[3902.56 - 3906.24] let's chop up a tomato what i do is i
[3904.40 - 3908.00] always take the top of the tomato off
[3906.24 - 3909.68] i don't know how you guys like to do it
[3908.00 - 3911.52] i mean i still eat that

[4084.08 - 4087.04] some onion games

[4092.56 - 4095.44] lemon on top of here too
[4094.08 - 4097.44] you guys i know you're gonna eat all
[4095.44 - 4098.40] your fats every day because put a little
[4097.44 - 4100.56] cucumber too
[4098.40 - 4102.08] i get it everybody's eating their fats
[4100.56 - 4104.32] right it's not that you can't have a
[4102.08 - 4106.32] little avocado or some sesame tahini and
[4104.32 - 4109.04] stuff it's just that we're taught to
[4106.32 - 4111.04] do both animal protein and plant fats
[4109.04 - 4112.32] animal fat and plant fat every single
[4111.04 - 4114.64] day and if we're plant
[4112.32 - 4116.48] based we're taught to just pound the
[4114.64 - 4117.36] plant fats and fat ourselves to death
[4116.48 - 4118.88] and if we're
[4117.36 - 4121.92] and if we're animal protein we're taught
[4118.88 - 4121.92] the same thing right
[4125.36 - 4129.04] problem is with tomato sauces is you
[4127.44 - 4131.92] know you're on a pizza
[4129.04 - 4132.64] you got all that oil in the tomato sauce
[4131.92 - 4134.32] right
[4132.64 - 4135.84] then you're out or that pasta with the
[4134.32 - 4138.24] cheesy pasta
[4135.84 - 4139.84] you got all the gluten from the bread
[4138.24 - 4141.60] and the pasta and everything so that's a
[4139.84 - 4143.76] whole nother thing all on its own right
[4141.60 - 4147.84] so i'm gonna i'm gonna thinly slice some
[4143.76 - 4147.84] cucumber here thin slices you guys
[4149.92 - 4155.44] chicken parmesan you got the cheese
[4153.36 - 4156.88] got the cheese on there with all that
[4155.44 - 4161.84] oil and the sauce
[4156.88 - 4161.84] right okay
[4161.92 - 4165.92] tomatoes take the blame they take the
[4164.80 - 4168.48] blame
[4165.92 - 4170.88] would you guys want the blame on you
[4168.48 - 4172.56] would you guys want the blame on you
[4170.88 - 4173.84] for everything that goes wrong for all
[4172.56 - 4175.12] these other things you guys want the
[4173.84 - 4176.64] blame on you
[4175.12 - 4180.00] i don't think you guys want the blame
[4176.64 - 4183.44] right i just don't think so
[4180.00 - 4184.96] um like i was talking about the blame on
[4183.44 - 4186.72] the celery juice
[4184.96 - 4188.40] right still to this day there's always
[4186.72 - 4191.76] somebody that puts out a post
[4188.40 - 4192.64] trying to take mm down right it's
[4191.76 - 4195.20] hilarious
[4192.64 - 4197.28] about the celery juice or something else
[4195.20 - 4199.04] or reporting to get you know reporting
[4197.28 - 4200.16] constantly to get me censored more and

[4207.20 - 4212.80] i like having salads i like to do lots
[4209.52 - 4212.80] here so let's take a look
[4213.36 - 4217.84] it's another couple minutes over there
[4225.36 - 4228.48] so you guys i just want to talk about
[4226.48 - 4230.32] the blood draw for a couple seconds
[4228.48 - 4231.76] it's important because i keep on seeing
[4230.32 - 4234.08] it all the time hey i just got all my
[4231.76 - 4235.92] blood work done and i'm low in vitamin d
[4234.08 - 4237.28] hey i just got my blood work done and
[4235.92 - 4239.28] i'm low in calcium
[4237.28 - 4240.40] it's like you just got all your blood
[4239.28 - 4242.00] taken out of you
[4240.40 - 4244.08] now you're definitely going to be low in
[4242.00 - 4246.72] everything so that's something to really
[4244.08 - 4248.24] to really um keep in mind i'm going to
[4246.72 - 4249.60] put the ketchup in this little cup right
[4248.24 - 4252.80] here
[4249.60 - 4252.80] to get ready for the fries
[4253.44 - 4257.60] learn how to protect yourself with the
[4255.12 - 4260.00] blood draws
[4257.60 - 4261.28] i can't tell you how i you guys know
[4260.00 - 4262.40] i've talked about this before and i
[4261.28 - 4265.04] don't want to
[4262.40 - 4266.88] to bore you guys on this but women are
[4265.04 - 4269.04] the blood donors
[4266.88 - 4271.36] sick women they've been brainwashed and
[4269.04 - 4273.12] taught to donate blood
[4271.36 - 4275.36] just so you know so that that's who
[4273.12 - 4277.60] donates blood it's women that are sick
[4275.36 - 4278.56] struggling women that their health isn't
[4277.60 - 4280.80] good
[4278.56 - 4282.56] and that's who's that's who is taught to
[4280.80 - 4285.20] donate all the blood right
[4282.56 - 4287.12] not strong men that aren't sick not even
[4285.20 - 4289.04] strong women that aren't sick
[4287.12 - 4290.48] i know that there's some of both that
[4289.04 - 4291.68] donate blood don't get me wrong there's
[4290.48 - 4292.16] strong men that donate blood there's
[4291.68 - 4293.44] some
[4292.16 - 4295.04] there's strong women that donate blood
[4293.44 - 4296.08] but sick women are the ones that are
[4295.04 - 4297.68] actually taught
[4296.08 - 4299.36] they're being brainwashed to donate
[4297.68 - 4301.60] blood and i'm not against
[4299.36 - 4302.64] donating blood that's not it but but
[4301.60 - 4304.32] when you listen to the medical mean
[4302.64 - 4305.76] podcast at apple podcast the blood draw
[4304.32 - 4307.60] episode you'll learn how to do it
[4305.76 - 4310.88] carefully and protect yourself
[4307.60 - 4314.88] i'm not against it totally not totally
[4310.88 - 4317.36] right my sister is a phlebotomist she
[4314.88 - 4318.16] said she has to take that much blood to
[4317.36 - 4321.68] get
[4318.16 - 4323.52] uh serum that's not true angie marie
[4321.68 - 4325.68] that's not true i've had phlebotomists
[4323.52 - 4328.32] on here say that's not true
[4325.68 - 4329.44] so i've had lab technicians on here
[4328.32 - 4330.88] already that all
[4329.44 - 4333.12] like the last couple of months and
[4330.88 - 4334.96] that's not true i talked to doctors that
[4333.12 - 4337.04] know about the stuff that's not true
[4334.96 - 4338.88] um yeah they only need it they only need
[4337.04 - 4340.64] a dot a dot of blood
[4338.88 - 4342.40] and they they they only need a quarter
[4340.64 - 4343.12] vial really if they want to play around
[4342.40 - 4345.60] with anything
[4343.12 - 4347.12] with it quarter vial each vial right not
[4345.60 - 4349.68] full vials they don't need
[4347.12 - 4350.80] 80 milliliters 70 milliliters 140
[4349.68 - 4352.40] milliliters
[4350.80 - 4354.00] they don't need all that it's just what
[4352.40 - 4357.76] it is it's not that your sister's
[4354.00 - 4359.52] wrong it's your sister's misinformed
[4357.76 - 4361.04] that's what it is so your sister's a
[4359.52 - 4362.32] phlebotomist but she's a phlebotomist
[4361.04 - 4363.92] that's not been given the correct
[4362.32 - 4367.44] information that's all
[4363.92 - 4370.00] it's not that she's she's right for
[4367.44 - 4371.84] the misinformation she has she's right
[4370.00 - 4373.44] about the misinformation she just
[4371.84 - 4376.08] doesn't know it's misinformation
[4373.44 - 4377.52] the system's broken and what they're
[4376.08 - 4380.00] doing is
[4377.52 - 4381.20] they're vamping women kind right now
[4380.00 - 4382.88] that's what they're doing
[4381.20 - 4384.32] women are the ones that get the blood
[4382.88 - 4387.44] tests every day
[4384.32 - 4389.28] it's women men men i
[4387.44 - 4390.72] every time i talk to like a family and i
[4389.28 - 4392.80] talk to you talk to
[4390.72 - 4394.32] um a woman in the family and she's just
[4392.80 - 4396.08] like well yeah my husband doesn't really
[4394.32 - 4398.08] get too much blood drawn ever it's like
[4396.08 - 4401.52] he got blood drawn like three years
[4398.08 - 4403.36] ago five years ago um i get my blood
[4401.52 - 4404.64] drawn because of my cfs because of this
[4403.36 - 4406.00] because of that i get blood drawn
[4404.64 - 4407.12] because of my fibroid i get blood drawn
[4406.00 - 4407.92] because of this i get blood drawn
[4407.12 - 4410.24] because of that
[4407.92 - 4412.00] and um and i also my doctor wants
[4410.24 - 4412.96] regular blood work from me ever since i
[4412.00 - 4414.72] had my babies
[4412.96 - 4416.88] regular blood work you know all of that
[4414.72 - 4420.48] right so what it is is the system
[4416.88 - 4424.32] vamps women kind i really believe
[4420.48 - 4427.04] from information that i've
[4424.32 - 4428.56] heard from powerful people in the world
[4427.04 - 4429.92] and information from spirit of
[4428.56 - 4433.68] compassion
[4429.92 - 4435.84] that there is there is a dirty dirty
[4433.68 - 4439.52] dirty dirty dirty dirty
[4435.84 - 4442.48] system around bleeding women to death
[4439.52 - 4444.56] to a slow death there is a dirty system
[4442.48 - 4446.72] set up on that just letting you know
[4444.56 - 4447.92] it and it's not the doctors doing it the
[4446.72 - 4450.24] doctor isn't doing it
[4447.92 - 4451.68] so and it's about literally draining
[4450.24 - 4455.60] women
[4451.68 - 4457.84] of their of this precious resource
[4455.60 - 4459.68] in draining sick women of this precious
[4457.84 - 4460.24] resource the system's not just broken
[4459.68 - 4462.40] it's it's
[4460.24 - 4464.00] it's it's yeah courtney it's scary so
[4462.40 - 4466.40] scary and
[4464.00 - 4467.76] that's how it's designed right so that's
[4466.40 - 4470.72] one of the ways
[4467.76 - 4473.28] there's there there is a movement out
[4470.72 - 4475.68] there that people don't realize
[4473.28 - 4478.32] yeah um you seem fine to me chris chris
[4475.68 - 4481.52] my blood was drawn because the wind blew
[4478.32 - 4482.24] yeah marissa aw stands up and empowers
[4481.52 - 4484.80] us women
[4482.24 - 4486.64] marissa i'm honored honored you're here
[4484.80 - 4490.08] thank you for being here um
[4486.64 - 4493.20] and but but there is there is a
[4490.08 - 4494.40] scary thing happening that's doing this
[4493.20 - 4497.28] for women in their
[4494.40 - 4498.88] and and robbing their doing this to
[4497.28 - 4501.12] women and robbing their blood
[4498.88 - 4502.64] the blood supply knocking down their
[4501.12 - 4505.76] immune systems
[4502.64 - 4508.08] experimenting with their blood okay
[4505.76 - 4508.88] all of this this is a precious resource
[4508.08 - 4511.52] and it's not
[4508.88 - 4512.00] tree it's treated like trash your blood
[4511.52 - 4514.24] is just
[4512.00 - 4516.56] trash and then one of the brainwashing
[4514.24 - 4519.52] techniques that's happening out there
[4516.56 - 4521.44] is you you should do this you should
[4519.52 - 4523.92] donate your blood or
[4521.44 - 4524.96] you should get your get your blood draws
[4523.92 - 4526.96] because you're just you're
[4524.96 - 4528.96] you're getting rid of old blood and then
[4526.96 - 4531.36] fresh blood
[4528.96 - 4533.20] fresh blood is like clean it comes out
[4531.36 - 4534.80] clean and your body produces fresh blood
[4533.20 - 4537.12] that's not how it works
[4534.80 - 4538.16] that's not how it works that's a trick
[4537.12 - 4540.40] so there it's a
[4538.16 - 4542.32] bloodletting trick too i'm not saying
[4540.40 - 4544.80] don't donate blood we need we do need
[4542.32 - 4545.44] donations for blood but they don't use
[4544.80 - 4547.68] all
[4545.44 - 4549.04] the amount of people donating blood and
[4547.68 - 4551.28] the fact that
[4549.04 - 4552.64] they only need a fraction of that in
[4551.28 - 4555.44] hospitals
[4552.64 - 4556.72] where does all the rest of it go just
[4555.44 - 4558.00] pretend they throw it all away then
[4556.72 - 4559.28] they're throwing away millions of
[4558.00 - 4561.36] gallons of women's blood
[4559.28 - 4563.28] millions of gallons are thrown away
[4561.36 - 4564.08] michael says too many red blood cells
[4563.28 - 4565.44] have to get
[4564.08 - 4567.28] well that's the technique instead of
[4565.44 - 4568.64] knowing what's wrong with the person
[4567.28 - 4570.24] instead of knowing how to fix them
[4568.64 - 4571.76] instead of knowing why too many red
[4570.24 - 4572.40] blood cells is a viral condition but
[4571.76 - 4574.16] they don't want to
[4572.40 - 4575.60] do any science research studies on that
[4574.16 - 4576.80] and figure out how to fix it
[4575.60 - 4578.88] so they're just still yeah they just
[4576.80 - 4581.76] want to take your blood so it's done
[4578.88 - 4583.52] to get these fries out you guys make a
[4581.76 - 4595.84] little room for them too
[4583.52 - 4595.84] what's going to do um
[4597.44 - 4600.72] got some fries right here i don't know
[4599.20 - 4603.44] if you guys can see this a little bit i
[4600.72 - 4603.44] think so right
[4603.84 - 4610.08] so let me get a little plate for this
[4607.44 - 4611.84] it's a nice bowl right here so i'm gonna
[4610.08 - 4613.44] get some fries in here now you can get
[4611.84 - 4614.88] them as toasty as you want
[4613.44 - 4618.40] you'll see that this one right here is a
[4614.88 - 4619.76] little extra toasty see that you guys
[4618.40 - 4621.68] that one right there is a little extra
[4619.76 - 4623.44] toasty right
[4621.68 - 4625.52] now there's no oil on this on these
[4623.44 - 4626.40] fries just so you know that keep that in
[4625.52 - 4630.24] mind
[4626.40 - 4631.92] there's no oil on these i don't advise
[4630.24 - 4633.12] you to use your hand like this and just
[4631.92 - 4635.36] grab them like this
[4633.12 - 4637.92] i just have for some reason since i was
[4635.36 - 4639.44] a kid i could handle intense heat with
[4637.92 - 4642.48] my hands
[4639.44 - 4645.44] like really really
[4642.48 - 4646.64] intense levels of heat with my hands so
[4645.44 - 4649.44] i'm just saying so i don't
[4646.64 - 4650.80] don't don't do what i'm doing right now
[4649.44 - 4653.28] like i can't even
[4650.80 - 4654.64] like this doesn't even bother me but
[4653.28 - 4657.12] someone else they'd be
[4654.64 - 4658.40] they'd be like crying probably so just
[4657.12 - 4661.04] don't do that
[4658.40 - 4662.88] and i've been known in my family since i
[4661.04 - 4666.32] was a kid
[4662.88 - 4668.48] that my hands can handle the heat
[4666.32 - 4671.12] big time just let you guys know that's
[4668.48 - 4674.32] something in my family that's well known
[4671.12 - 4677.44] so but don't do that whenever you do
[4674.32 - 4678.96] okay check out these fries

[4788.32 - 4791.68] protocols in the back of this book

[4791.68 - 4794.72] this book too there's proto protocols
[4793.44 - 4797.84] through this book with
[4794.72 - 4799.68] supplements and dosages to conditions
[4797.84 - 4801.12] and you know a friend of mine was
[4799.68 - 4802.24] telling what supplements do i like
[4801.12 - 4804.16] i haven't talked to them in years i'm
[4802.24 - 4805.68] like are you kidding the dimmer g
[4804.16 - 4807.84] that's the magnesium glycinate from
[4805.68 - 4811.12] vimergy
[4807.84 - 4811.60] m sky when you steam first and then bake
[4811.12 - 4814.16] you get
[4811.60 - 4815.68] crunch on the outside and full yep
[4814.16 - 4819.20] fluffy potatoes on the inside
[4815.68 - 4821.92] em skye that's what i did you guys
[4819.20 - 4823.12] you guys um here's the vimergy stuff
[4821.92 - 4826.08] that i always recommend
[4823.12 - 4826.32] okay i'm not sponsored but v is victor i
[4826.08 - 4829.76] m
[4826.32 - 4830.72] e r g y dot com their supplements are
[4829.76 - 4832.96] unmatched
[4830.72 - 4834.64] austin knows i think austin uses bemidji
[4832.96 - 4838.00] from what i remember
[4834.64 - 4839.92] um and so the books have
[4838.00 - 4841.68] supplements protocols if anybody ever
[4839.92 - 4844.08] wanted to venture into supplementation
[4841.68 - 4846.48] and protocols to learn how to heal
[4844.08 - 4847.84] i mean the information is there i just
[4846.48 - 4850.00] don't talk about
[4847.84 - 4852.40] you know everything else i talk about
[4850.00 - 4855.60] everything else that's the whole point
[4852.40 - 4857.12] so anyway magnesium is important
[4855.60 - 4860.40] so many people need magnesium it's
[4857.12 - 4863.04] ridiculous it's so critical
[4860.40 - 4864.96] they rob and steal any chance for you
[4863.04 - 4867.60] guys to heal
[4864.96 - 4868.32] that's what they do and keep that in
[4867.60 - 4870.00] mind
[4868.32 - 4872.08] the industries including the alternative
[4870.00 - 4875.68] industries that's what they do
[4872.08 - 4876.72] it's sad but true it's a big club out
[4875.68 - 4880.00] there
[4876.72 - 4883.12] they all mirror the same old
[4880.00 - 4885.12] and that's how they do it
[4883.12 - 4886.40] and then they secretly drink celery
[4885.12 - 4889.68] juice
[4886.40 - 4892.96] behind the scenes many of them do
[4889.68 - 4893.44] i'm letting you know okay i want you
