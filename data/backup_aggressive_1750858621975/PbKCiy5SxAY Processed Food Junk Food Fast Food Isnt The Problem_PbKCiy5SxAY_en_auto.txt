[136.56 - 139.92] it's true
[137.92 - 141.52] it's bad
[139.92 - 145.20] absolutely
[141.52 - 148.80] yes it'll contribute to obesity it will

[148.80 - 153.76] your heart attack
[150.64 - 155.68] it will contribute to cardiovascular
[153.76 - 159.84] problems
[155.68 - 162.00] it will contribute to diabetes right
[159.84 - 164.72] type 2 diabetes it will make you
[162.00 - 166.00] diabetic over time
[164.72 - 168.88] okay
[166.00 - 171.28] it can contribute to that
[168.88 - 173.92] yeah all that grease and all that
[171.28 - 175.84] processed oil and all that fried oil oil
[173.92 - 177.28] and all that junk and everything else
[175.84 - 180.00] and right
[177.28 - 182.72] all that we dump inside of us fast foods
[180.00 - 184.72] and processed foods and all that sure
[182.72 - 186.56] it's going to bring us closer to obesity
[184.72 - 189.84] it's going to bring us closer to a heart
[186.56 - 192.88] attack that's why i always say butter
[189.84 - 194.08] butter's like the heart attacker
[192.88 - 197.12] butter
[194.08 - 199.12] that's the heart attack bringer
[197.12 - 202.00] right
[199.12 - 204.40] but what about the raging
[202.00 - 206.96] raging illnesses happening and the
[204.40 - 209.28] autoimmune and the fatigue and the
[206.96 - 210.84] seeing and that and the chronic fatigue
[209.28 - 213.92] syndrome the
[210.84 - 215.36] mecfs and the fibro and the hoshi so
[213.92 - 217.04] wait a minute
[215.36 - 219.28] fast food
[217.04 - 221.20] gives you hoshis
[219.28 - 223.92] what gives you hashimoto's is it fast
[221.20 - 224.80] food that gives you hashimoto's
[223.92 - 226.48] so
[224.80 - 229.52] this is an important conversation
[226.48 - 232.16] because i know in the health scene
[229.52 - 233.52] i know for quite a while now in the last
[232.16 - 235.60] 10 years
[233.52 - 237.60] all these people these brainiacs these
[235.60 - 239.68] geniuses coming up in the health scene
[237.60 - 241.52] feel like they found they found it all
[239.68 - 242.32] they figured it all out
[241.52 - 243.68] it's
[242.32 - 245.12] all that fast food it's all the
[243.68 - 246.40] processed food
[245.12 - 248.48] it's going into the fast food
[246.40 - 250.96] restaurants that's what's killing us all
[248.48 - 252.56] that's what's doing it it's all that so
[250.96 - 254.16] let's go we'll make some documentary
[252.56 - 255.76] that oh we'll go and do we'll do this
[254.16 - 257.68] about it oh we'll go and put some books
[255.76 - 259.84] out about it
[257.68 - 261.84] without even understanding why anybody
[259.84 - 266.24] gets sick without even understanding our
[261.84 - 267.60] knowing why or how anyone gets sick
[266.24 - 270.40] anyone
[267.60 - 272.00] young people get sick
[270.40 - 274.48] right
[272.00 - 276.00] how much fast food is someone eating by
[274.48 - 278.08] the time they're nine years old
[276.00 - 279.60] meanwhile they got thyroid diagnoses at
[278.08 - 282.00] nine years old
[279.60 - 284.64] they are crippling fatigue and brain fog
[282.00 - 287.52] at nine years old they got crippling
[284.64 - 292.16] eczema and psoriasis at nine years old
[287.52 - 294.88] so what is it the 50 years of fast foods
[292.16 - 297.12] and nine year olds nine years old
[294.88 - 298.80] what is it the 50 years of processed
[297.12 - 302.88] food that's what got the nine-year-old
[298.80 - 302.88] sick 50 years does that make any sense
[304.40 - 309.44] 50 years of processed foods and fast
[306.88 - 310.80] foods and greasy fried foods
[309.44 - 312.24] and that's what made a nine-year-old
[310.80 - 313.92] sick when nine-year-olds only nine years
[312.24 - 316.24] old
[313.92 - 319.12] norma said study just came out linking
[316.24 - 321.84] ms to ebv and you've been saying this
[319.12 - 324.32] all along published first medical medium
[321.84 - 326.88] that's medical medium information public
[324.32 - 329.60] published first and then science
[326.88 - 331.36] poaches and steals medical medium
[329.60 - 332.64] information
[331.36 - 334.56] that's what they do
[332.64 - 336.40] that's how they learn science and
[334.56 - 338.00] chronic illness now they they go to the
[336.40 - 339.28] medical medium books into the medical
[338.00 - 340.32] medium lectures and all the medical
[339.28 - 342.00] medium
[340.32 - 343.84] work that's been done and they take the
[342.00 - 346.32] information they extract it and they try
[343.84 - 348.16] to advance forward with that
[346.32 - 349.44] in certain areas
[348.16 - 350.32] but don't worry they'll just be shut
[349.44 - 352.72] down
[350.32 - 354.96] down the road when they link that then
[352.72 - 357.76] they'll be classified medical research
[354.96 - 360.96] and science will stomp on them
[357.76 - 363.28] like they were a turkey in thanksgiving
[360.96 - 365.12] it'll just stomp on them
[363.28 - 369.04] you know that's the one thing even if
[365.12 - 371.12] they try even if alternative science or
[369.04 - 373.44] conventional science takes medical
[371.12 - 375.12] medium information about epstein-barr
[373.44 - 377.84] causing multiple sclerosis which is
[375.12 - 379.60] which is medical medium right and they
[377.84 - 382.16] take that and they try to now do studies
[379.60 - 384.08] to try to link it right
[382.16 - 385.84] big bad wolf
[384.08 - 387.36] up in the sky classified medical
[385.84 - 389.20] research and science will jump on them
[387.36 - 390.00] so quick and pounce on them and eat them
[389.20 - 392.08] up
[390.00 - 394.48] because they don't want that getting out
[392.08 - 397.28] there so it's kind of a battle out there
[394.48 - 400.80] and how that works
[397.28 - 402.72] so what's making the eight year old
[400.80 - 404.72] so sick they got thyroid disorders at
[402.72 - 406.16] eight years old is it 50 years of
[404.72 - 408.00] processed foods
[406.16 - 410.00] no
[408.00 - 412.56] they're eight years old
[410.00 - 415.52] what's making the five-year-old get
[412.56 - 418.32] raging eczema psoriasis is it 60 years
[415.52 - 421.44] of processed food
[418.32 - 422.40] and fast food and greasy food no

[428.40 - 432.64] thinks you're a genius about it

[435.44 - 438.80] right
[436.48 - 441.04] how's the five-year-old
[438.80 - 442.24] getting eczema psoriasis
[441.04 - 444.08] i mean

[444.08 - 450.08] why it's copper it's viruses plus toxic
[446.72 - 452.00] heavy metals like copper right

[540.32 - 545.12] talk about the processed food a little
[541.84 - 547.68] bit yes processed food isn't good yes
[545.12 - 549.68] yes fried foods greasy foods it's not
[547.68 - 550.64] good it's bad
[549.68 - 551.44] true
[550.64 - 553.68] true
[551.44 - 556.32] it'll clog up that liver is what it's
[553.68 - 559.04] going to do it'll clog up that liver so
[556.32 - 559.04] let's take a look
[559.12 - 563.12] the more and more grease you stick in
[561.44 - 565.12] you and the more and more fried
[563.12 - 567.44] processed oil and grease you stick in
[565.12 - 569.12] you okay
[567.44 - 570.88] the more and more your liver has to get
[569.12 - 573.68] overburdened overburdened overburdened
[570.88 - 577.04] you kill your liver with that
[573.68 - 580.00] well what that does that just leads
[577.04 - 581.52] people to the obesity factor the weight
[580.00 - 583.76] gain comes on because their liver is
[581.52 - 586.56] being bogged down by all that grease and
[583.76 - 589.52] all that that processed food right and
[586.56 - 591.20] all that fast food okay and then once
[589.52 - 593.04] that liver gets beaten down like that
[591.20 - 594.96] you end up with type 2 diabetes now
[593.04 - 596.00] you're pre-diabetic yes
[594.96 - 597.92] and then
[596.00 - 600.16] all that fat from those processed foods
[597.92 - 601.92] and fried greasy foods starts to cling
[600.16 - 603.52] to your arteries and your veins and
[601.92 - 605.52] cling to your heart starts to get into
[603.52 - 607.28] your heart right there right
[605.52 - 610.56] and your valves
[607.28 - 612.80] gets into the veins and arteries right
[610.56 - 614.48] and so guess what yeah
[612.80 - 616.80] you end up
[614.48 - 618.72] gaining weight you end up
[616.80 - 620.32] heart attack city down the road when

[733.76 - 738.48] right you can do that okay
[736.64 - 741.28] there's a lot of people though they have
[738.48 - 743.76] a difficulty difficult time going raw
[741.28 - 745.60] and going raw
[743.76 - 746.72] doesn't mean you're still going to get
[745.60 - 748.72] better
[746.72 - 751.60] like medical medium information like the
[748.72 - 753.28] 28 day cleanse or the 369 advance
[751.60 - 755.84] they're raw
[753.28 - 757.60] but they're raw designed in a specific
[755.84 - 759.20] way to take somebody to where they need
[757.60 - 761.76] to go take them to a finish line of
[759.20 - 763.60] healing right but you can still heal
[761.76 - 766.48] eating cooked
[763.60 - 768.00] and you can still heal eating cooked
[766.48 - 770.32] all the way
[768.00 - 772.48] that's why the banana mono cleanses a
[770.32 - 774.40] raw cleanse right in the medical medium
[772.48 - 775.84] cleanse the heel book but there's also a
[774.40 - 778.32] potato
[775.84 - 781.28] mono cleanse which is your steaming
[778.32 - 783.36] potatoes and you're actually able to go
[781.28 - 785.44] all the way to on that level with
[783.36 - 788.24] steamed potatoes
[785.44 - 790.16] you don't lose minerals with cooked food
[788.24 - 792.32] what happens is the reason why you feel
[790.16 - 794.88] dried out with cooked food and you feel
[792.32 - 796.56] dried out like that the reason why you
[794.88 - 798.84] feel that way
[796.56 - 802.16] is because
[798.84 - 803.68] nerves that's a nerve thing so your
[802.16 - 805.44] tongue can be dried out your mouth can
[803.68 - 807.92] feel dried out you can feel dried out
[805.44 - 810.00] overall when you're doing cooked
[807.92 - 811.92] because the nervous system that means
[810.00 - 814.72] there's a nervous system sensitivity
[811.92 - 815.84] happening that's what that is
[814.72 - 818.88] and
[815.84 - 820.80] so so cooked food in general can
[818.88 - 822.56] rub a certain way
[820.80 - 824.96] on the tongue
[822.56 - 826.88] and that's your vagus nerve all of that
[824.96 - 828.40] your mouth your throat
[826.88 - 830.32] it all depends on what's happening if
[828.40 - 832.24] you have sensitive vagus nerve issues on
[830.32 - 834.24] any level even if it's just sensitive
[832.24 - 835.44] digestion sensitive vagus nerves what's
[834.24 - 837.68] that whatever
[835.44 - 839.92] cooked food can feel differently and it
[837.68 - 841.52] all depends on what the cooked food is
[839.92 - 843.36] too like what the cooked food is but
[841.52 - 844.72] that's interesting i mean i'm glad
[843.36 - 847.12] you're raw and you're doing raw that's
[844.72 - 850.32] amazing
[847.12 - 853.20] all raw is not the answer though meaning
[850.32 - 854.48] any just raw is not the answer so i know
[853.20 - 855.68] we're talking about processed foods and
[854.48 - 857.28] everything else but it's interesting to
[855.68 - 859.28] talk about this too
[857.28 - 860.88] is that there's raw diets out there that
[859.28 - 863.36] are high fat
[860.88 - 864.24] and a high fat raw diet
[863.36 - 865.84] still
[864.24 - 869.28] can bring you
[865.84 - 871.84] down on your knees sick and not healing
[869.28 - 874.88] where you're like oh my god i'm all raw
[871.84 - 878.48] i'm doing everything i can i found this
[874.88 - 880.48] raw diet out there and i'm still sick
[878.48 - 882.72] and i can't get better and i'm still
[880.48 - 884.40] fatigued and i still have skin problems
[882.72 - 886.00] and what is it
[884.40 - 887.60] meanwhile you're tanking the nut butters
[886.00 - 889.36] and you're taking all the oils and
[887.60 - 891.52] you're taking the avocado too much and
[889.36 - 892.96] you're taking more nut butters
[891.52 - 894.08] and then you're doing more oil then
[892.96 - 896.16] you're doing
[894.08 - 899.44] more avocado and then you're doing
[896.16 - 901.44] something else and yeah you're all raw
[899.44 - 903.68] and then you're doing the olive oil hey
[901.44 - 906.56] i got this great raw coconut oil and
[903.68 - 908.40] you're doing all these oils and fats and
[906.56 - 909.68] then you're just stuck still it happens
[908.40 - 911.52] to so many people and then they get
[909.68 - 913.60] stuck
[911.52 - 915.28] you can heal doing cooked food you can
[913.60 - 917.84] try that protocol and heal you and cook
[915.28 - 919.28] food you can heal doing raw food as long
[917.84 - 920.88] as you know what you're doing though it
[919.28 - 922.40] all matters the details matter you can't
[920.88 - 926.28] just be raw and that's the answer i
[922.40 - 926.28] thought oats were inflammatory
[927.28 - 930.72] oats are not
[929.36 - 933.84] a food
[930.72 - 937.68] that's like a healing food
[933.84 - 940.96] but oats are not a herding food
[937.68 - 944.80] so they're not a herding food oats
[940.96 - 946.64] don't feed viruses
[944.80 - 949.20] see that's important to know so oats
[946.64 - 952.64] don't feed viruses
[949.20 - 955.36] and viruses are inflammatory so that's
[952.64 - 958.64] important to know right there
[955.36 - 960.56] oats and millet are two
[958.64 - 962.32] grains right there that medical medium
[960.56 - 964.32] information says you can eat but it
[962.32 - 966.88] doesn't mean you have to if you don't
[964.32 - 968.00] want to do oats like in the protocols in
[966.88 - 970.40] the book there's so many different
[968.00 - 971.76] avenues like there's no there's no mono
[970.40 - 974.08] oatmeal
[971.76 - 975.52] diet in the medical medium book
[974.08 - 976.88] for a reason
[975.52 - 981.04] right
[976.88 - 983.44] and oats aren't in the 369 cleanse right
[981.04 - 986.00] meaning like the advanced cleanse
[983.44 - 988.00] but oats are kind of like a filler do
[986.00 - 990.32] they have nutrition in them yeah they
[988.00 - 993.52] have nutrients in them okay but the key
[990.32 - 997.44] thing about oats all right is oats don't
[993.52 - 998.80] feed viruses viruses are why everybody's
[997.44 - 1002.08] inflamed
[998.80 - 1003.84] right and oats don't feed the viruses
[1002.08 - 1005.52] so that gets them inflamed it's
[1003.84 - 1008.24] important to know they're not an
[1005.52 - 1010.80] inflammatory food
[1008.24 - 1012.32] so they're not an inflammation producing
[1010.80 - 1014.88] food
[1012.32 - 1017.20] but gluten is make sure gluten-free oats
[1014.88 - 1018.64] that's important to know there too
[1017.20 - 1019.84] so let's start making this and we'll get
[1018.64 - 1021.68] them in the oven and we'll talk more
[1019.84 - 1024.08] about what's happening it's good to see
[1021.68 - 1027.04] you guys it's an honor to be here so
[1024.08 - 1029.44] what i'm gonna do is mash up two bananas
[1027.04 - 1032.72] it's the first thing i'm gonna do
[1029.44 - 1035.20] let's throw a couple of bananas in here
[1032.72 - 1035.20] and
[1035.76 - 1039.56] see that couple bananas
[1040.64 - 1044.80] every time
[1042.96 - 1046.08] somebody gets an epiphany right in the
[1044.80 - 1047.76] healing movement say a doctor or
[1046.08 - 1049.68] something they want to start a podcast
[1047.76 - 1050.96] they want to write a book they want to
[1049.68 - 1052.80] start teaching they want to start
[1050.96 - 1054.40] lecturing about health foods or health
[1052.80 - 1056.72] healthy living and all that they get
[1054.40 - 1059.60] this epiphany where
[1056.72 - 1062.80] they want to lose some weight
[1059.60 - 1064.72] they want to do better things for others
[1062.80 - 1066.32] they are in conventional medicine they
[1064.72 - 1068.80] want to back down off of conventional
[1066.32 - 1071.52] medicine a little bit and they want to
[1068.80 - 1072.56] head to a place of like an awakening
[1071.52 - 1073.76] happens
[1072.56 - 1075.60] wow
[1073.76 - 1077.68] fast food and greasy foods and fried
[1075.60 - 1079.52] foods and processed foods that's the
[1077.68 - 1081.20] problem all this time
[1079.52 - 1083.36] that's what it is
[1081.20 - 1084.72] or it's the lectins and oxalates in all
[1083.36 - 1088.24] these foods
[1084.72 - 1090.48] or it's bad foods like fast foods and
[1088.24 - 1092.08] some other food issues too but they get
[1090.48 - 1094.56] wrapped up into this whole thing like i
[1092.08 - 1095.92] found the answer i got the light bulb i
[1094.56 - 1097.60] got the answer
[1095.92 - 1099.68] everybody's sick because they're eating
[1097.60 - 1102.24] bad
[1099.68 - 1105.04] do you see how it goes you guys
[1102.24 - 1106.24] anybody jumping into the health scene
[1105.04 - 1107.76] green
[1106.24 - 1109.60] green
[1107.76 - 1111.44] jumps in like
[1109.60 - 1113.36] oh my god
[1111.44 - 1115.36] i figured it out
[1113.36 - 1117.04] all these years of just doing my normal
[1115.36 - 1118.96] stuff going into medical school and out
[1117.04 - 1121.12] of medical school eating what i wanted
[1118.96 - 1122.64] drinking alcohol on the weekends all
[1121.12 - 1124.24] these years i figured it out because i'm
[1122.64 - 1126.32] starting to gain a little weight around
[1124.24 - 1128.24] my waist and as a doctor i started
[1126.32 - 1130.40] figuring it out you can't have processed
[1128.24 - 1132.72] foods all those people are bad at the
[1130.40 - 1134.48] fast food restaurant line you guys are
[1132.72 - 1135.92] all eating fast foods that's the whole
[1134.48 - 1137.60] thing and they have this epiphany this
[1135.92 - 1141.36] awakening like oh they discovered
[1137.60 - 1141.36] everything they discovered it
[1141.44 - 1144.88] then they start telling their patients
[1142.96 - 1146.32] shouldn't be eating fast foods and then
[1144.88 - 1148.24] they want to write a book let's write a
[1146.32 - 1150.08] book and make sure we talk about how all
[1148.24 - 1152.32] these greasy foods are killing americans
[1150.08 - 1154.80] or killing europeans or killing whoever
[1152.32 - 1156.64] around the world right
[1154.80 - 1158.00] and they think i'm mashing two bananas
[1156.64 - 1160.80] in here because i'm making these oatmeal
[1158.00 - 1160.80] cookies right now
[1162.32 - 1167.28] and then they think they discovered the
[1164.32 - 1167.28] holy grail
[1168.08 - 1173.84] they actually discovered atlantis
[1171.28 - 1175.44] the lost city of atlantis
[1173.84 - 1177.12] they discovered it
[1175.44 - 1179.44] they figured it out after all these
[1177.12 - 1181.36] years everybody's sick because
[1179.44 - 1182.80] they're just eating all this junk food
[1181.36 - 1184.96] and fast food and processed food that's
[1182.80 - 1188.32] why everybody's sick
[1184.96 - 1190.16] we just we just figured it out
[1188.32 - 1191.20] right
[1190.16 - 1192.80] and
[1191.20 - 1194.24] real i'm gonna put some cinnamon in here
[1192.80 - 1198.32] too
[1194.24 - 1198.32] okay a little bit of cinnamon in this
[1199.92 - 1204.56] i'm gonna put a little bit of maple
[1201.44 - 1207.12] syrup in here too if you guys don't mind
[1204.56 - 1209.68] robin says what's the difference
[1207.12 - 1213.60] between gluten-free oats regular ones
[1209.68 - 1213.60] what makes oats gluten-free
[1213.68 - 1218.16] processing is the big one
[1215.76 - 1220.56] okay so processing is a really big one
[1218.16 - 1222.08] the processing right the facility
[1220.56 - 1224.80] i'm going to put a little maple syrup in
[1222.08 - 1226.24] here facilities that are also churning
[1224.80 - 1227.76] out wheat
[1226.24 - 1231.04] germ
[1227.76 - 1233.04] they're churning wheat germ out
[1231.04 - 1234.56] they're churning
[1233.04 - 1235.84] what else are they churning out wheat
[1234.56 - 1237.28] germ
[1235.84 - 1239.84] um
[1237.28 - 1239.84] bagels
[1240.00 - 1242.80] bagels
[1241.20 - 1245.20] loaves of bread
[1242.80 - 1247.68] loaves loaves of processed bread white
[1245.20 - 1249.12] bread right they're churning all this
[1247.68 - 1250.88] out
[1249.12 - 1253.28] and then also they're going to run some
[1250.88 - 1255.12] oats through the machine well we ran
[1253.28 - 1257.12] oats through the machine after we just
[1255.12 - 1259.20] ran all the those breadcrumbs those
[1257.12 - 1261.68] white breadcrumbs to the machine and now
[1259.20 - 1264.08] we're packaging up oats oh oats are
[1261.68 - 1266.24] gluten free right
[1264.08 - 1269.44] christina says won't oatmeal bananas and
[1266.24 - 1271.68] maple syrup spike your insulin a lot
[1269.44 - 1274.24] well that's
[1271.68 - 1276.80] that's what people believe
[1274.24 - 1278.08] so let's go into that you just you just
[1276.80 - 1280.16] you just
[1278.08 - 1281.52] set the pace for a good diabetic talk
[1280.16 - 1283.52] for a couple of seconds including
[1281.52 - 1284.96] hypoglycemia and other issues like that
[1283.52 - 1287.20] blood sugar issues let's just throw some
[1284.96 - 1289.36] raisins in here i'm gonna be spiking my
[1287.20 - 1292.64] blood sugar i'm gonna be spiking my
[1289.36 - 1294.40] blood sugar really bad right here
[1292.64 - 1297.28] this is gonna throw me into major
[1294.40 - 1298.80] diabetic like coma
[1297.28 - 1301.92] or something
[1298.80 - 1305.84] i'm gonna put a few raisins in here
[1301.92 - 1305.84] that should be good i'm gonna put some
[1306.16 - 1310.40] so let's go into that
[1309.28 - 1314.08] sugar
[1310.40 - 1315.04] doesn't create insulin resistance
[1314.08 - 1318.00] sugar
[1315.04 - 1320.56] carbohydrates does not create insulin
[1318.00 - 1323.36] resistance it's fat so i'm looking for
[1320.56 - 1324.40] the fat here where's the fat
[1323.36 - 1325.84] where is it
[1324.40 - 1327.12] fat are you in there
[1325.84 - 1328.72] where are you
[1327.12 - 1331.52] where's the oils
[1328.72 - 1333.36] where's all the oils where's the fat
[1331.52 - 1335.20] where's the olive oil
[1333.36 - 1337.04] where's the coconut oil
[1335.20 - 1338.56] where's the nut butter where's the nuts
[1337.04 - 1340.64] where are you guys
[1338.56 - 1343.36] how come you're not here
[1340.64 - 1344.64] are you guys in here where are you
[1343.36 - 1346.80] huh
[1344.64 - 1348.48] hey wait
[1346.80 - 1351.60] i can't find you
[1348.48 - 1352.88] so all i'm seeing is oats raisins
[1351.60 - 1355.68] bananas
[1352.88 - 1358.48] and cinnamon and maple syrup
[1355.68 - 1361.76] i'm not seeing any fats
[1358.48 - 1365.76] this can't spike your insulin
[1361.76 - 1368.64] this can't jack up your a1c
[1365.76 - 1370.08] this doesn't create diabetes
[1368.64 - 1372.24] okay
[1370.08 - 1375.44] very important to know
[1372.24 - 1377.92] what this does is this helps to fix
[1375.44 - 1380.40] those problems because guess what's
[1377.92 - 1382.32] missing out of here there's no oils
[1380.40 - 1384.40] there's no nut butters there's no fats
[1382.32 - 1386.48] there's no grease there's no lard
[1384.40 - 1389.48] there's no crisco there's no nothing in
[1386.48 - 1389.48] here
[1389.84 - 1392.72] very important now
[1393.20 - 1396.32] okay so i'm gonna go with a couple of
[1394.88 - 1400.84] cups
[1396.32 - 1400.84] see a couple cups of oats here
[1403.04 - 1408.56] a little measurement
[1405.44 - 1408.56] just one cup there
[1408.64 - 1413.36] go with another cup
[1410.96 - 1415.20] roughly
[1413.36 - 1417.84] i think that might be good see what we
[1415.20 - 1417.84] got
[1424.16 - 1427.32] all right
[1434.80 - 1440.00] this is important to know right here
[1436.40 - 1442.24] okay you guys critical point
[1440.00 - 1445.28] when you eat fat
[1442.24 - 1446.56] which i call radical fats right
[1445.28 - 1448.24] when you eat the nut butter i'm not
[1446.56 - 1450.08] saying nut butters are bad for you i'm
[1448.24 - 1452.16] not saying avocado is bad for you i'm
[1450.08 - 1454.56] not saying healthy fats are bad for you
[1452.16 - 1457.52] i'm just saying that when you have fat
[1454.56 - 1460.48] even when it's chicken or meat or nut
[1457.52 - 1464.08] butters or oils or anything like that
[1460.48 - 1467.28] when you eat the fat it stops sugar from
[1464.08 - 1469.76] entering your cells
[1467.28 - 1472.24] it holds up the insulin the insulin just
[1469.76 - 1475.44] gets all caught up in the bloodstream it
[1472.24 - 1477.84] can't get sugar into your cells
[1475.44 - 1480.48] it's the fat that's doing it it's not
[1477.84 - 1480.48] the sugar
[1483.52 - 1486.48] this is a really important time for some
[1485.44 - 1488.64] of you guys
[1486.48 - 1490.80] that have been brainwashed about the
[1488.64 - 1492.64] whole sugar thing and the whole diabetic
[1490.80 - 1494.24] thing in the whole in the whole you know
[1492.64 - 1496.40] hypoglycemic thing and the whole
[1494.24 - 1498.88] hypersonic hyperside
[1496.40 - 1500.48] heart glycemic thing sorry it's
[1498.88 - 1503.76] you just need to know this is like an
[1500.48 - 1506.24] awakening moment right here because
[1503.76 - 1507.84] wait a minute it's not the sugar what
[1506.24 - 1510.24] are you saying like what are you even
[1507.84 - 1512.48] talking about it's not the sugar
[1510.24 - 1513.76] no it's not
[1512.48 - 1518.20] it's not the sugar at all i'm going to
[1513.76 - 1518.20] add a little bit more oatmeal to this
[1529.20 - 1533.44] ice cream
[1530.72 - 1536.88] jacks up that blood sugar
[1533.44 - 1538.80] ice cream's the a1c nightmare ice cream
[1536.88 - 1540.08] is the diabetic nightmare i don't care
[1538.80 - 1541.76] if it's coconut ice cream i don't care
[1540.08 - 1544.00] if it's vegan ice cream i don't care if
[1541.76 - 1546.56] it's planet mars ice cream i don't care
[1544.00 - 1550.24] if an alien ship
[1546.56 - 1550.24] arrived from pluto
[1551.60 - 1557.84] and dropped off
[1553.60 - 1557.84] a new batch of ice cream for everybody
[1562.72 - 1566.64] that ice cream is sugar and fat combined
[1564.96 - 1568.48] and when that ice cream is sugar and fat
[1566.64 - 1569.76] combined you got the diabetic nightmare
[1568.48 - 1571.92] you got the blood sugar nightmare you
[1569.76 - 1573.36] got the insulin resistance nightmare
[1571.92 - 1576.40] and that's why everybody on the
[1573.36 - 1577.76] processed foods eventually gets the a1c
[1576.40 - 1579.04] and the diabetic nightmare and
[1577.76 - 1580.88] everything else
[1579.04 - 1582.96] that's why the processed food thing the
[1580.88 - 1584.56] fast food the greasy fried food that's
[1582.96 - 1586.64] why i was trying to tell you guys all
[1584.56 - 1588.32] the genius doctors or genius health
[1586.64 - 1590.32] professionals or genius health
[1588.32 - 1591.68] influencers when they get that epiphany
[1590.32 - 1593.84] in awakening and they're like i'm not
[1591.68 - 1596.16] supposed to eat processed food anymore
[1593.84 - 1598.08] oh dear lord i think i found the answer
[1596.16 - 1599.44] everybody everybody it's processed food
[1598.08 - 1601.04] now i'm gonna go hit the circuit because
[1599.44 - 1602.96] i'm a genius now i'll come out my new
[1601.04 - 1605.60] book here's why you shouldn't eat fast
[1602.96 - 1608.32] foods and processed foods and junk foods
[1605.60 - 1610.56] and what happens is because
[1608.32 - 1612.64] yeah you eat that stuff you're gonna end
[1610.56 - 1613.92] up a diabetic you eat that stuff you're
[1612.64 - 1615.36] going to eventually have some weight
[1613.92 - 1617.04] gain you eat that stuff and you're going
[1615.36 - 1620.32] to get a heart attack
[1617.04 - 1624.40] but that's not why everybody is sick
[1620.32 - 1627.52] it's not why everybody's sick you guys

[1631.60 - 1637.12] year old yes a 12 year old neurological
[1634.32 - 1639.28] lyme disease have anything to do with

[1639.28 - 1643.44] processed food and fast food
[1641.44 - 1645.52] it doesn't have anything to do with it

[1878.96 - 1881.20] right
[1881.28 - 1884.80] is it because of processed foods
[1884.88 - 1888.80] then
[1886.16 - 1890.56] how can how come somebody else who had
[1888.80 - 1894.80] processed foods all these years didn't
[1890.56 - 1894.80] get als just curious
[1896.64 - 1900.96] if someone has
[1899.60 - 1902.24] alzheimer's
[1900.96 - 1904.16] dementia
[1902.24 - 1905.60] right is it because of the fast foods
[1904.16 - 1907.36] and the greasy foods and the fried foods
[1905.60 - 1908.96] they had all these years what about the
[1907.36 - 1910.48] other person who didn't get alzheimer's
[1908.96 - 1911.76] dementia
[1910.48 - 1913.12] and they've been eating the fast foods
[1911.76 - 1914.40] processed foods and greasy foods all
[1913.12 - 1916.64] these years
[1914.40 - 1919.12] what about that
[1916.64 - 1922.80] what about the person right
[1919.12 - 1925.12] who has crippling depression
[1922.80 - 1926.88] suicidal thoughts they don't want to be
[1925.12 - 1929.76] here anymore
[1926.88 - 1931.28] they're suffering and agony
[1929.76 - 1932.96] and they've been eating processed foods
[1931.28 - 1934.40] and fast foods and greasy foods but what
[1932.96 - 1936.00] about the other person who's been eating
[1934.40 - 1937.20] fast food processed foods greasy foods
[1936.00 - 1939.52] but they don't have the crippling
[1937.20 - 1943.04] depression on a level
[1939.52 - 1944.88] or that they're in that condition
[1943.04 - 1946.80] so you know when this whole epiphany
[1944.88 - 1948.08] happens to like a health professional
[1946.80 - 1949.52] where they wake up one morning and
[1948.08 - 1952.32] they're like whoa it's the processed
[1949.52 - 1954.40] foods doing it
[1952.32 - 1955.76] someone said which book are you are the
[1954.40 - 1957.60] cookies from i just want to answer that
[1955.76 - 1959.28] it's cleanse the heal suzanne cleans the
[1957.60 - 1962.48] heel
[1959.28 - 1964.40] amazon.com us 51 off
[1962.48 - 1966.40] it costs more to print it it's a medical
[1964.40 - 1968.32] textbook get it free at the library you
[1966.40 - 1970.40] can get it free at the library
[1968.32 - 1971.52] don't even have to do like honestly if
[1970.40 - 1972.80] everybody just went to the library and
[1971.52 - 1976.00] got it for free i would be happy because
[1972.80 - 1978.88] i want people to have the book
[1976.00 - 1980.24] so when we have this whole thing happen
[1978.88 - 1982.16] in the world of health and i've watched
[1980.24 - 1984.24] it for years
[1982.16 - 1986.56] i've watched these awakenings happen in
[1984.24 - 1988.48] health professionals for years
[1986.56 - 1991.52] where they think they have now all the
[1988.48 - 1993.76] answers so they start there
[1991.52 - 1995.36] but it's way more complicated than that
[1993.76 - 1997.36] it's way more in depth than that it's
[1995.36 - 1999.28] way more
[1997.36 - 2001.60] important to know what's really
[1999.28 - 2003.04] happening there's so much more people
[2001.60 - 2004.48] don't know
[2003.04 - 2006.40] so why do we get that crippling
[2004.48 - 2008.88] depression we get it because of toxic
[2006.40 - 2011.04] heavy metals in the brain why do we get
[2008.88 - 2013.76] that crippling als because we get toxic
[2011.04 - 2015.52] heavy metals in the brain plus viruses
[2013.76 - 2017.68] why do we get multiple sclerosis because
[2015.52 - 2019.36] of epstein-barr virus
[2017.68 - 2022.48] also people with multiple sclerosis are
[2019.36 - 2024.00] high in mercury and epstein-barr right
[2022.48 - 2026.40] we get these other problems because of
[2024.00 - 2028.48] these reasons and yes fast foods
[2026.40 - 2030.00] processed foods and and
[2028.48 - 2033.52] and
[2030.00 - 2035.84] junk foods are not helpful on any level
[2033.52 - 2037.76] but it's not solely the problem and
[2035.84 - 2040.88] let's go into that a little bit why can
[2037.76 - 2043.12] someone eat all that junk for years and
[2040.88 - 2044.88] then they get their heart attack
[2043.12 - 2046.72] when they're 50 or 55 they get their
[2044.88 - 2048.96] heart attack when they're 60
[2046.72 - 2051.04] but then someone else
[2048.96 - 2052.24] right
[2051.04 - 2055.04] someone else
[2052.24 - 2057.60] got sick with something else
[2055.04 - 2058.96] what's going on there right when someone
[2057.60 - 2060.80] didn't get sick with something else and
[2058.96 - 2062.32] they have this heart attack later on
[2060.80 - 2064.56] like how does that happen so let's cut
[2062.32 - 2066.00] into it and let's go into it
[2064.56 - 2067.84] right now
[2066.00 - 2069.44] what you're going to see is neurological
[2067.84 - 2071.44] problems on the rise more than ever
[2069.44 - 2073.12] before in history it already is and has
[2071.44 - 2074.64] been i've been talking about this for 35
[2073.12 - 2076.00] years but we're at a place where
[2074.64 - 2077.76] neurological problems are going to
[2076.00 - 2079.04] dominate in such a way that no one can
[2077.76 - 2080.96] even imagine
[2079.04 - 2082.08] so it's not just depression anxiety and
[2080.96 - 2084.48] ocd
[2082.08 - 2085.52] and all that all the mental health
[2084.48 - 2087.60] right
[2085.52 - 2090.08] complications that people suffer from
[2087.60 - 2091.60] but it's gonna be the fatigue the muscle
[2090.08 - 2094.00] weakness the dizziness more than ever
[2091.60 - 2096.48] before the vertigo the balance issues
[2094.00 - 2098.88] right the tinnitus the burning skin the
[2096.48 - 2100.96] jabbing jaw pain the neck pain the back
[2098.88 - 2103.92] pain unexplainable back pain feet pain
[2100.96 - 2105.28] right sleeping problems insomnia
[2103.92 - 2107.44] restless leg syndrome it's going to be
[2105.28 - 2110.56] all this times a million it's just going
[2107.44 - 2113.92] to be all this times 10 million all this
[2110.56 - 2117.20] times a billion is what it's going to be
[2113.92 - 2119.76] and it's not because of a processed food
[2117.20 - 2122.08] so what do we have to look out for or
[2119.76 - 2124.24] worry about it's viruses
[2122.08 - 2128.08] and bacteria
[2124.24 - 2128.96] toxic heavy metals poisons right
[2128.08 - 2130.96] so
[2128.96 - 2132.16] i i saw the other day
[2130.96 - 2133.84] right a friend of mine showed me
[2132.16 - 2136.16] something and said look this this really
[2133.84 - 2138.08] smart doctor guy who writes a book said
[2136.16 - 2139.60] it's radiation in the airports we got to
[2138.08 - 2140.96] look out for well that's medical medium
[2139.60 - 2142.32] information i'm the only one that talked
[2140.96 - 2144.96] about all the radiation in the airports
[2142.32 - 2147.12] for years and years and years so okay
[2144.96 - 2149.28] great and he's saying that's the problem
[2147.12 - 2151.20] like that's not the problem
[2149.28 - 2153.44] that's a contributor
[2151.20 - 2156.40] that that's a trigger but that's not the
[2153.44 - 2159.60] problem it's amazing how we can just we
[2156.40 - 2161.60] it's what we attach ourselves to right
[2159.60 - 2163.76] it's what our psyche kind of gravitate
[2161.60 - 2167.36] gravitates to it's like if someone's
[2163.76 - 2169.20] like totally gets jazzed up on whoa it's
[2167.36 - 2171.36] the processed food whoa it's that then
[2169.20 - 2173.36] that's got to be the answer it's a fast
[2171.36 - 2175.36] food then that's what they're all into
[2173.36 - 2177.28] right or whoa you're right there's
[2175.36 - 2178.96] radiation in the airport that's what
[2177.28 - 2180.48] it's got to be it's the radiation in the
[2178.96 - 2182.96] airport and they get attached to that
[2180.48 - 2185.76] they're like whoa that's it
[2182.96 - 2187.68] but it's just more than this
[2185.76 - 2190.16] you can take someone
[2187.68 - 2192.16] who gets radiated
[2190.16 - 2194.96] they breathe in all these fragrances and
[2192.16 - 2197.60] candles and clones of perfumes
[2194.96 - 2199.84] they get exposed to pesticides
[2197.60 - 2201.36] insecticides
[2199.84 - 2203.04] right
[2201.36 - 2205.68] and they still
[2203.04 - 2207.28] stay okay for a while they still stay
[2205.68 - 2209.36] okay for a while and then you get
[2207.28 - 2211.60] somebody else that breathes in a little
[2209.36 - 2213.92] bit of pesticide breathes in some
[2211.60 - 2217.60] scented candles freeze in a little bit
[2213.92 - 2217.60] of mold somewhere and they go down
[2217.84 - 2221.68] because you have to have the pathogens
[2219.92 - 2223.28] internally
[2221.68 - 2224.72] you have to have the pathogens
[2223.28 - 2226.48] internally
[2224.72 - 2227.76] they have to be there
[2226.48 - 2230.08] and that's why people got the
[2227.76 - 2232.88] hashimoto's and hyperthyroidism and they
[2230.08 - 2234.80] got the cysts and nodules on the thyroid
[2232.88 - 2236.96] and that's why they got the fatigue and
[2234.80 - 2238.08] that's why they got the cfs
[2236.96 - 2239.84] and that's why they have the skin
[2238.08 - 2242.56] disorders and the excellent psoriasis
[2239.84 - 2244.88] you have to have the pathogen somewhere
[2242.56 - 2247.36] that's advanced information you have to
[2244.88 - 2250.08] have the viruses the epstein bars the h
[2247.36 - 2252.80] the hsv1 hsb2 you got the shingles you
[2250.08 - 2256.96] got to have the hhv6 cytomegalovirus you
[2252.80 - 2258.80] have to have the pathogens and viruses
[2256.96 - 2261.12] is what you need
[2258.80 - 2263.04] can be hard said sounds like lime and
[2261.12 - 2265.52] bartonella bartonel is not a lyme
[2263.04 - 2268.40] problem barnell is what you've been told
[2265.52 - 2271.84] a long time ago is is a cause of lyme
[2268.40 - 2272.88] it's not neurological lyme is is viral
[2271.84 - 2274.48] so that's
[2272.88 - 2276.24] the viruses and maybe that's what you
[2274.48 - 2278.88] were leading to
[2276.24 - 2281.84] it's what you're alluding to with that
[2278.88 - 2283.36] right barnell is not superbug barnella
[2281.84 - 2285.76] doesn't create
[2283.36 - 2288.00] doesn't create neurological symptoms
[2285.76 - 2289.52] right burnell is a bacteria that doesn't
[2288.00 - 2291.68] create bacteria doesn't create
[2289.52 - 2293.44] neurological symptoms very important to
[2291.68 - 2294.88] know i talk about that in the books like
[2293.44 - 2298.08] if you go into the lyme section of
[2294.88 - 2300.56] cleanse of heal you'll see that
[2298.08 - 2304.96] so neurological problems are caused by
[2300.56 - 2307.92] neurotoxins produced by viruses
[2304.96 - 2310.88] and that's how it's done
[2307.92 - 2313.36] barnella is not as strong as mrsa
[2310.88 - 2316.40] but people can kick mrsa
[2313.36 - 2318.48] right merce is a superbug
[2316.40 - 2320.32] created by
[2318.48 - 2321.44] um classified medical research and
[2320.32 - 2323.84] science
[2321.44 - 2326.40] deliberately put into hospitals
[2323.84 - 2329.20] just so you know
[2326.40 - 2331.84] mrs a super bug
[2329.20 - 2333.92] and they can still kill mrsa off people
[2331.84 - 2335.84] have a better recovery rate with mrsa
[2333.92 - 2337.20] than bartonella
[2335.84 - 2339.28] so you got all these people with
[2337.20 - 2340.56] neurological lyme suffering
[2339.28 - 2343.04] and they can't get rid of this
[2340.56 - 2345.12] bartonella barnella dies instantly with
[2343.04 - 2347.04] penicillin
[2345.12 - 2348.80] with penicillin
[2347.04 - 2351.76] i'm not talking about all these other
[2348.80 - 2354.40] design crafted antibiotics
[2351.76 - 2356.88] that they have to use for super bugs
[2354.40 - 2359.36] barnella dies with penicillin never mind
[2356.88 - 2362.00] doxy or anything else
[2359.36 - 2364.00] and bartonel is not the cause of lyme
[2362.00 - 2365.76] so that's important to know the cause of
[2364.00 - 2368.64] lyme disease
[2365.76 - 2370.96] is something that creates neurological
[2368.64 - 2374.48] symptoms bacteria doesn't create
[2370.96 - 2374.48] neurological symptoms
[2375.68 - 2381.20] lisa says burnell is a virus
[2378.08 - 2382.48] and mrsa is a bacteria
[2381.20 - 2383.44] well
[2382.48 - 2384.96] for
[2383.44 - 2387.52] 25 years they've been saying
[2384.96 - 2388.80] bartonella's a bacteria so maybe they
[2387.52 - 2390.24] flipped it
[2388.80 - 2393.52] because they don't know what is what
[2390.24 - 2396.24] anymore so but barnell is bacteria
[2393.52 - 2400.88] borrelia's bacteria babies is a hybrid
[2396.24 - 2403.04] in bacteria and merce is a bacteria
[2400.88 - 2405.12] i don't know what else to tell you
[2403.04 - 2407.04] and those bacteria aren't why people are
[2405.12 - 2408.08] sick with neurological lyme or lyme
[2407.04 - 2410.24] disease
[2408.08 - 2412.08] that's why they've been antibiotic to
[2410.24 - 2414.56] death for years and decades and decades
[2412.08 - 2417.04] people lost their lives from antibiotics
[2414.56 - 2419.04] because they were told it was bartonella
[2417.04 - 2421.36] people's lives were destroyed and ruined
[2419.04 - 2423.20] because of that
[2421.36 - 2425.68] if you want to have some compassion for
[2423.20 - 2428.16] people out there that lost their lives
[2425.68 - 2432.40] from being antibiotic to death
[2428.16 - 2434.96] for bartonella and babisia and borrelia
[2432.40 - 2436.40] then that's one place to go because
[2434.96 - 2438.08] that's where i go all the time because i
[2436.40 - 2439.92] feel horrible for people who lost their
[2438.08 - 2441.12] lives from that
[2439.92 - 2442.88] i can't tell you how many people walk
[2441.12 - 2444.48] through the door in my office and how
[2442.88 - 2447.68] many lime doctors called me up at my
[2444.48 - 2449.20] office throughout the last 35 years
[2447.68 - 2450.48] and they learned the truth about what
[2449.20 - 2452.00] caused neurological lyme and they're
[2450.48 - 2453.68] like so what do we do i said we need
[2452.00 - 2455.68] your lysine
[2453.68 - 2457.28] you have to have your zinc
[2455.68 - 2459.20] you have to have your antivirals you
[2457.28 - 2460.56] have to have your licorice root
[2459.20 - 2462.08] and all of a sudden the neurological
[2460.56 - 2463.76] line you have to have your cat cat's
[2462.08 - 2465.20] claw and all of a sudden the
[2463.76 - 2466.88] neurological lyme patients we're all
[2465.20 - 2467.92] getting better at these doctor's offices
[2466.88 - 2468.88] and they're like oh my god this is
[2467.92 - 2471.28] unbelievable because we've been
[2468.88 - 2472.96] antibiotic doing the antibiotic thing
[2471.28 - 2474.72] with our patients over and over and over
[2472.96 - 2476.96] again because we keep on thinking they
[2474.72 - 2478.56] have borrelia and bartonella
[2476.96 - 2480.16] they don't
[2478.56 - 2481.36] and if you want to learn more about that
[2480.16 - 2484.08] just so you know
[2481.36 - 2486.48] they never see bartonella
[2484.08 - 2488.08] and they never see borrelia if you read
[2486.48 - 2489.84] about lyme disease you'll learn how the
[2488.08 - 2491.92] lyme labs work
[2489.84 - 2493.76] they don't see bartonella so here you
[2491.92 - 2495.68] are be like here you'll be like and
[2493.76 - 2497.04] listen this is no disrespect i i've a
[2495.68 - 2499.92] lot of respect for you for being here
[2497.04 - 2502.24] talking about this this is a great topic
[2499.92 - 2504.80] what people don't realize is at the lime
[2502.24 - 2506.80] lab they never see bartonella they don't
[2504.80 - 2509.20] see it did you know that
[2506.80 - 2511.20] they don't see it under a microscope nor
[2509.20 - 2513.04] do they see borrelia when you get your
[2511.20 - 2515.36] blood sent to
[2513.04 - 2518.16] the lab
[2515.36 - 2520.88] they just test for an inflammatory
[2518.16 - 2522.72] marker and they plug in the name
[2520.88 - 2524.80] they put the name in
[2522.72 - 2526.80] it's the biggest scam
[2524.80 - 2528.56] ever in our history
[2526.80 - 2530.72] probably one of the biggest scams in our
[2528.56 - 2534.68] history pretty pretty incredible really
[2530.72 - 2534.68] checking the cookies you guys
[2536.00 - 2539.04] cookies aren't done yet
[2539.12 - 2544.88] when you get your blood tested at a lyme
[2542.24 - 2545.92] lab they're just doing an inflammatory
[2544.88 - 2548.64] test
[2545.92 - 2551.12] it's kind of like an a a
[2548.64 - 2554.32] it's a c-reactive protein
[2551.12 - 2556.00] okay very important to know
[2554.32 - 2558.24] so and
[2556.00 - 2560.40] that's the trick of the trade so the
[2558.24 - 2562.08] lyme disease labs never see
[2560.40 - 2564.88] they never see your bartonelli your
[2562.08 - 2566.88] borrelia your your your lovisia they
[2564.88 - 2569.04] never see any of that
[2566.88 - 2571.20] that's what's sad about it it's been a
[2569.04 - 2573.12] scam running for a long time and a lot
[2571.20 - 2574.96] of people lost their lives over it now
[2573.12 - 2577.44] but you know what's funny
[2574.96 - 2578.96] and amazing now there's lime doctors now
[2577.44 - 2580.88] using protocols using medical medium
[2578.96 - 2582.24] protocols right but they're plugging in
[2580.88 - 2583.92] the cats cloud they're lowering the
[2582.24 - 2587.20] antibiotics and they're getting people
[2583.92 - 2588.24] some results first time in history
[2587.20 - 2590.08] because they're using medical bean
[2588.24 - 2591.92] protocols i taught about this for years
[2590.08 - 2594.08] i talked to dozens and dozens of lyme
[2591.92 - 2595.76] doctors all through the east coast all
[2594.08 - 2597.92] through the country
[2595.76 - 2599.36] and i got the lyme doctors to test for
[2597.92 - 2601.36] epstein-barr and what the lyme doctors
[2599.36 - 2603.36] were doing they're like oh my god
[2601.36 - 2605.52] this patient has epstein barr
[2603.36 - 2607.84] anthony william was right
[2605.52 - 2609.36] i think we're on to something eureka
[2607.84 - 2610.56] we're onto something
[2609.36 - 2612.24] why do you think
[2610.56 - 2614.08] they talk about anybody with lyme
[2612.24 - 2615.60] disease now that goes like public with
[2614.08 - 2617.20] it that might be like a big public
[2615.60 - 2618.32] figure or a celebrity and they talk
[2617.20 - 2620.00] about their lyme disease why do you
[2618.32 - 2621.52] think they say i have lyme disease and
[2620.00 - 2624.00] epstein-barr
[2621.52 - 2626.96] that's kind of funny
[2624.00 - 2628.00] which you really have is epstein-barr
[2626.96 - 2629.44] and that's what's causing your
[2628.00 - 2631.12] neurological symptoms and what are those
[2629.44 - 2634.08] neurological symptoms tingles and
[2631.12 - 2635.44] numbness fatigue brain fog don't feel
[2634.08 - 2637.52] good
[2635.44 - 2639.60] yeah that's your ebv
[2637.52 - 2642.00] that's your ebv
[2639.60 - 2645.04] antibiotics ruined my gut
[2642.00 - 2647.20] kristen i feel for you truly i've seen
[2645.04 - 2649.84] antibiotics kill people
[2647.20 - 2651.04] for years and years and years with lyme
[2649.84 - 2653.20] disease
[2651.04 - 2657.36] they get so weak and here's the thing
[2653.20 - 2657.36] too okay they get so weak
[2657.84 - 2662.88] and the sicker they get
[2659.60 - 2664.88] they take more blood the sicker they get
[2662.88 - 2667.44] they take more blood and that's how a
[2664.88 - 2668.88] lyme disease patient dies
[2667.44 - 2669.60] they die
[2668.88 - 2672.00] from
[2669.60 - 2673.20] getting blood tests
[2672.00 - 2676.32] faster
[2673.20 - 2678.72] and more vials and faster and more vials
[2676.32 - 2680.00] and more in between and more in between
[2678.72 - 2682.32] meaning
[2680.00 - 2684.32] one week apart one week apart one week
[2682.32 - 2686.56] apart two weeks apart one week apart
[2684.32 - 2689.28] let's take 27 more vials let's take 30
[2686.56 - 2691.84] vials let's take 40 vials let's take you
[2689.28 - 2693.28] know let's take 50 vials right
[2691.84 - 2694.40] and that's what they do
[2693.28 - 2696.24] so they're just
[2694.40 - 2698.08] taking blood let's give you more
[2696.24 - 2699.60] antibiotics oh you don't feel good well
[2698.08 - 2701.52] it's not the antibiotic that's that's
[2699.60 - 2702.80] making you not feel good something else
[2701.52 - 2705.36] is wrong we're going to keep on taking
[2702.80 - 2707.84] more blood from you this is how tens of
[2705.36 - 2710.40] thousands of lyme patients died in the
[2707.84 - 2711.92] last 40 years it's from all the blood
[2710.40 - 2713.60] taken
[2711.92 - 2716.56] and the game
[2713.60 - 2719.92] the chase for phantom bacteria
[2716.56 - 2722.72] when really they were viral if they had
[2719.92 - 2725.28] less blood drawn and they had a viral
[2722.72 - 2727.76] protocol like in cleanse to heal
[2725.28 - 2730.08] they would still be here now
[2727.76 - 2731.36] and thank god enough people got to me in
[2730.08 - 2733.44] my office throughout the years that
[2731.36 - 2735.28] enough doctors talk to me to save enough
[2733.44 - 2737.12] people with neurological life and that's
[2735.28 - 2738.48] why you see the world of lyme disease
[2737.12 - 2739.76] changed right now because the medical
[2738.48 - 2741.36] medium work
[2739.76 - 2743.04] that's why you see cats claw in the
[2741.36 - 2745.20] protocols that's why you see them lower
[2743.04 - 2748.08] the antibiotics
[2745.20 - 2748.08] it's important to know
[2749.76 - 2753.76] i'm gonna check out these cookies hold
[2751.28 - 2753.76] on you guys
[2755.60 - 2758.32] they're getting there
[2759.68 - 2762.48] so
[2760.80 - 2764.40] i just want to let everybody know
[2762.48 - 2766.32] that on rumble six o'clock eastern three
[2764.40 - 2767.60] o'clock pacific i'm gonna be exclusive
[2766.32 - 2768.88] there talking about something different
[2767.60 - 2770.08] a different topic
[2768.88 - 2771.68] we're not gonna be talking about lyme
[2770.08 - 2773.52] disease we're not gonna be talking about
[2771.68 - 2775.92] processed foods but this is good stuff
[2773.52 - 2777.04] we're talking about now i'm excited
[2775.92 - 2779.92] so let's
[2777.04 - 2782.72] go a little bit longer
[2779.92 - 2782.72] have some more fun
[2786.56 - 2791.84] where can we get tested for ebv
[2790.08 - 2794.64] with a family physician you just ask
[2791.84 - 2797.04] your doctor for an fc bar test
[2794.64 - 2798.48] that's that's a great way to start
[2797.04 - 2800.88] said nadine that's what you can do you
[2798.48 - 2803.04] can actually start that way
[2800.88 - 2805.12] you just ask for it
[2803.04 - 2807.04] that's that's what you can do
[2805.12 - 2808.56] family physician should be able to write
[2807.04 - 2809.60] that one up
[2808.56 - 2812.00] they can they can write that
[2809.60 - 2814.72] prescription for that blood test up
[2812.00 - 2817.12] okay have them test for past and present
[2814.72 - 2819.76] infection so keep that in mind past and
[2817.12 - 2822.08] present infection past infection means
[2819.76 - 2823.60] you still have epstein-barr
[2822.08 - 2824.40] so that'll give you the answer right
[2823.60 - 2827.12] there
[2824.40 - 2830.32] so test for past and present
[2827.12 - 2832.16] infection that's important right there
[2830.32 - 2833.84] in medical medium book one which is the
[2832.16 - 2835.20] new addition now when that hit the scene
[2833.84 - 2836.96] it broke the news about what
[2835.20 - 2839.36] epstein-barr caused it causes all these
[2836.96 - 2841.28] neurological symptoms it's not the fast
[2839.36 - 2843.28] foods it's not the processed foods and
[2841.28 - 2846.24] the junk foods
[2843.28 - 2847.92] what about having lyme and ms
[2846.24 - 2850.08] well if you read in the cleanse of heal
[2847.92 - 2852.48] books you'll see that multiple sclerosis
[2850.08 - 2854.08] is caused by epstein-barr and mercury
[2852.48 - 2856.72] and you'll see that neurological lyme is
[2854.08 - 2858.16] also viral too which sepsis and bar
[2856.72 - 2859.44] a lot of people have one or two
[2858.16 - 2861.20] varieties of epstein-barr they'll have a
[2859.44 - 2863.12] shingles virus too
[2861.20 - 2864.80] and they'll be high in mercury as well
[2863.12 - 2866.56] mercury is hard to test for it because
[2864.80 - 2868.48] with mercury it doesn't mean it's in
[2866.56 - 2870.56] your bloodstream it's in the organs it
[2868.48 - 2872.56] could be all in the organs so you can't
[2870.56 - 2874.96] you can't get a good accurate test
[2872.56 - 2876.72] through the blood because of that
[2874.96 - 2879.76] when it's sitting inside organs it's
[2876.72 - 2881.52] hard to actually get a test
[2879.76 - 2883.76] so
[2881.52 - 2884.84] basically it's like this if someone
[2883.76 - 2887.68] didn't have a
[2884.84 - 2890.24] pathogen they can eat all the fast food
[2887.68 - 2891.68] they want all the junk food they want
[2890.24 - 2893.20] all the processed food they want until
[2891.68 - 2894.80] they get their heart attack
[2893.20 - 2896.24] or their diabetes
[2894.80 - 2898.24] or their hypertension into a heart
[2896.24 - 2901.60] attack
[2898.24 - 2904.16] important now if someone does it or a
[2901.60 - 2906.96] stroke if someone doesn't have
[2904.16 - 2909.20] if someone doesn't have the viruses in
[2906.96 - 2909.20] them
[2910.24 - 2914.64] they can spend a lifetime of processed
[2913.04 - 2916.56] junk food they can be pulling up to the
[2914.64 - 2918.96] fast food restaurant every day give me a
[2916.56 - 2920.96] double bacon cheeseburger please
[2918.96 - 2923.36] i'll take another pizza give me a bacon
[2920.96 - 2926.24] double cheese dog give me a bunch of
[2923.36 - 2928.80] onion rings give me some fries with with
[2926.24 - 2931.20] bacon bits on top bacon give me more
[2928.80 - 2931.20] bacon
[2931.76 - 2936.88] and they can do that for year after year
[2934.80 - 2939.12] after year until
[2936.88 - 2942.24] they drop dead
[2939.12 - 2943.36] until that artery gets clogged until
[2942.24 - 2946.08] they have a heart attack and that
[2943.36 - 2948.16] diabetes comes on
[2946.08 - 2949.68] until they have
[2948.16 - 2950.72] that
[2949.68 - 2953.12] stroke
[2950.72 - 2955.12] from big hunk of fat getting dislodged
[2953.12 - 2958.08] and floating up to the brain the point
[2955.12 - 2961.28] is if you don't have the pathogens you
[2958.08 - 2962.64] can eat all you want bring it on bring
[2961.28 - 2965.44] it in
[2962.64 - 2968.40] and you can do it until you die
[2965.44 - 2969.76] of a heart disease issue or something
[2968.40 - 2973.76] else
[2969.76 - 2976.32] if you don't have the pathogens
[2973.76 - 2977.44] when you have the pathogens the game
[2976.32 - 2980.40] changes
[2977.44 - 2982.24] it completely changes you guys
[2980.40 - 2984.32] that's when you get the hypothyroid
[2982.24 - 2986.00] that's when you get the hyperthyroid
[2984.32 - 2987.52] that's when you get the cancers that's
[2986.00 - 2988.72] when you get the als that's when you get
[2987.52 - 2990.16] the ms
[2988.72 - 2991.44] that's when you get the ra that's when
[2990.16 - 2993.60] you get the lupus that's when you get
[2991.44 - 2995.36] the neurological lyme that's why a 12
[2993.60 - 2999.28] year old can have neurological lyme
[2995.36 - 3002.40] that's why a 12 year old can have ra
[2999.28 - 3006.80] and fatigue think about that
[3002.40 - 3011.04] children's rheumatoid arthritis
[3006.80 - 3013.44] they didn't have 30 years of fast food
[3011.04 - 3017.12] but they have ra
[3013.44 - 3020.80] at 11 years old nine years old 14 years
[3017.12 - 3023.84] old they have debilitating ra
[3020.80 - 3027.68] and they don't have 50 years
[3023.84 - 3028.72] of junk food in them
[3027.68 - 3031.44] they have
[3028.72 - 3033.68] you know other things going on
[3031.44 - 3033.68] right
[3033.76 - 3039.28] and they have colitis
[3036.40 - 3041.76] right they can have debilitating colitis
[3039.28 - 3043.20] leukemia they can have other things
[3041.76 - 3045.20] they can be suffering with other
[3043.20 - 3048.40] disorders they can have
[3045.20 - 3050.24] eczema that's raging and debilitating
[3048.40 - 3052.56] psoriasis
[3050.24 - 3054.56] but they don't have 30 years of pulling
[3052.56 - 3056.40] up to that fast food restaurant and
[3054.56 - 3058.24] ordering all those bacon double cheese
[3056.40 - 3059.92] dogs and burgers
[3058.24 - 3061.28] in all those pizza fries or whatever the
[3059.92 - 3065.04] heck they're giving out there and all
[3061.28 - 3065.04] those buffalo chicken wings
[3065.28 - 3070.56] they don't have that in their system
[3068.32 - 3073.52] that's for the person who's not quite
[3070.56 - 3076.24] viral who's not quite pathogenic who
[3073.52 - 3078.08] maybe isn't pathogenic yet they don't
[3076.24 - 3080.40] have enough bugs in them yet and they
[3078.08 - 3082.40] can go and now they're 40 and now
[3080.40 - 3084.32] they're gaining weight yes and they're
[3082.40 - 3085.68] gaining weight and now they're heading
[3084.32 - 3087.20] to a place because of the processed
[3085.68 - 3088.32] foods and all the pizzas they're eating
[3087.20 - 3089.92] and everything else they're eating and
[3088.32 - 3090.72] the buffalo chicken wings and everything
[3089.92 - 3092.64] else
[3090.72 - 3094.08] now they're getting to the point where
[3092.64 - 3095.68] boom they can have their heart attack
[3094.08 - 3097.12] they can have their stroke they can have
[3095.68 - 3098.72] their fat clogging up their arteries in
[3097.12 - 3101.44] their heart and everything else and
[3098.72 - 3103.52] guess what if they get a pathogen
[3101.44 - 3106.32] they'll have that too
[3103.52 - 3108.16] you'll have lupus and heart disease
[3106.32 - 3109.68] you'll have multiple sclerosis and heart
[3108.16 - 3111.36] disease this is important to know right
[3109.68 - 3113.60] here you'll have neurological alignment
[3111.36 - 3115.76] heart disease you'll have ra and heart
[3113.60 - 3118.80] disease you'll have autoimmune and heart
[3115.76 - 3120.64] disease right if you have pathogens and
[3118.80 - 3122.40] your tank and the fast processed foods
[3120.64 - 3124.16] in the greasy foods you can have your
[3122.40 - 3125.84] diabetes heart problems and your
[3124.16 - 3128.64] neurological symptoms from all the
[3125.84 - 3129.92] pathogens do you see the details matter
[3128.64 - 3131.84] and that's why
[3129.92 - 3133.28] medicine is so off right now they can't
[3131.84 - 3135.20] even differ in differentia they can't
[3133.28 - 3136.88] even figure it out and be able to divide
[3135.20 - 3138.88] any of that they don't know any of the
[3136.88 - 3140.56] difference they're just like okay well
[3138.88 - 3141.84] you have autoimmune it's genetic okay
[3140.56 - 3143.44] what else do you have oh you have heart
[3141.84 - 3145.28] disease okay maybe you should back down
[3143.44 - 3146.80] on the processed foods that's pretty
[3145.28 - 3148.88] much it
[3146.80 - 3150.96] but they don't they don't know that whoa
[3148.88 - 3153.28] you got hhv-6 you got shingles you got
[3150.96 - 3155.84] epsine bar you've got sediment virus
[3153.28 - 3157.52] you've got simplex one the fever blister
[3155.84 - 3158.96] and it's causing all your jaw pain and
[3157.52 - 3161.20] your neck pain and your head pain and
[3158.96 - 3162.40] your eye your eye problems and your eye
[3161.20 - 3163.60] pain
[3162.40 - 3165.68] and they don't know that these things
[3163.60 - 3168.16] are causing reproductive problems too
[3165.68 - 3169.68] you can have endometriosis and still get
[3168.16 - 3172.88] heart disease down the road you could
[3169.68 - 3175.04] have pcos from viruses and still get
[3172.88 - 3178.08] your heart attack later on too you could
[3175.04 - 3178.08] have a combination
[3178.16 - 3181.52] and
[3179.44 - 3182.48] but all the
[3181.52 - 3184.72] all the
[3182.48 - 3186.64] people with big ideas in the health
[3184.72 - 3188.64] movement i think they figured it all out
[3186.64 - 3191.04] found the holy grail and they figured
[3188.64 - 3194.24] they they found it all out the big
[3191.04 - 3196.00] mystery they found atlantis
[3194.24 - 3198.08] they think it was just
[3196.00 - 3200.64] you're just eating all the wrong foods
[3198.08 - 3204.16] and once you clean up your diet
[3200.64 - 3206.24] you're gonna be all good that's not true
[3204.16 - 3208.40] sometimes you gotta dig deep and you
[3206.24 - 3210.24] gotta go for the gold because if you got
[3208.40 - 3212.00] enough pathogens and you you could be
[3210.24 - 3214.08] very young and you can clean up your
[3212.00 - 3217.04] diet and it's not enough you can clean
[3214.08 - 3219.12] up your diet as far as you want to go
[3217.04 - 3220.56] as far as the parameters they give you
[3219.12 - 3222.64] out there and it's not enough and then
[3220.56 - 3225.36] you have to learn what you're really
[3222.64 - 3229.04] doing and looking out for within that
[3225.36 - 3229.04] diet to get better
[3229.12 - 3232.40] that's why i see it all the time the
[3230.48 - 3234.80] vegans in a plant-based people they go
[3232.40 - 3236.64] plant-based and vegan they stay sick or
[3234.80 - 3238.80] they get sick
[3236.64 - 3240.40] and then they run back to animal protein
[3238.80 - 3242.64] thinking they are missing nutrients you
[3240.40 - 3244.08] know i just saw it recently someone was
[3242.64 - 3245.44] showing me something and it was like
[3244.08 - 3247.68] they're saying check this out check out
[3245.44 - 3249.20] this influencer here they went vegan one
[3247.68 - 3250.72] time in plant based and now they're
[3249.20 - 3252.40] talking about how they were missing all
[3250.72 - 3253.92] their nutrients
[3252.40 - 3255.36] they went vegan and plant-based and they
[3253.92 - 3256.80] were missing all their nutrients right
[3255.36 - 3258.40] now so now they're back on animal
[3256.80 - 3261.20] protein to make sure they get all their
[3258.40 - 3263.60] nutrients they're eating cottage cheese
[3261.20 - 3266.24] and they're having lots of yogurt
[3263.60 - 3268.08] and bovine yogurt and cottage cheese and
[3266.24 - 3269.68] they're having like raw cheese and
[3268.08 - 3272.24] they're having eggs and they're having
[3269.68 - 3273.52] salmon and they're having other fish
[3272.24 - 3275.36] and now they're getting all the
[3273.52 - 3277.04] nutrients they knew all the nutrients
[3275.36 - 3278.80] they need because when they were vegan
[3277.04 - 3281.20] and plant-based this influencer was
[3278.80 - 3282.08] vegan and plant-based they weren't doing
[3281.20 - 3283.04] good
[3282.08 - 3285.20] it's like
[3283.04 - 3286.32] whoa well i'm gonna feel really bad for
[3285.20 - 3288.64] that person because they're gonna do it
[3286.32 - 3290.00] real bad now
[3288.64 - 3291.36] meanwhile
[3290.00 - 3292.64] there's all these people eating animal
[3291.36 - 3294.48] protein eating all the same thing and
[3292.64 - 3298.16] they're sick out there i love how that
[3294.48 - 3298.16] works it doesn't make any sense right
[3299.28 - 3302.64] billions of people are eating animal
[3300.72 - 3304.64] protein and a fraction of people are
[3302.64 - 3306.00] they're plant-based right fraction of
[3304.64 - 3307.28] people and think about how many people
[3306.00 - 3309.04] are sick hospitals are filled with
[3307.28 - 3311.12] people eating animal protein including
[3309.04 - 3314.32] clean animal protein diets protein dyes
[3311.12 - 3315.20] including healthier animal protein diets
[3314.32 - 3316.56] right
[3315.20 - 3317.84] meanwhile they'll have the same problems
[3316.56 - 3318.88] that you know they'll have the same
[3317.84 - 3321.28] problem
[3318.88 - 3323.84] as the plant-based people right that are
[3321.28 - 3326.00] sick too that happens plant-based vegan
[3323.84 - 3327.68] person can be just as sick as an animal
[3326.00 - 3329.84] protein person they can have both the
[3327.68 - 3331.76] same sickness as hashimoto's
[3329.84 - 3333.44] they can have thyroid problems they can
[3331.76 - 3335.28] get told by their doctors their hormones
[3333.44 - 3337.20] are off they can have all the same
[3335.28 - 3339.44] problems everybody's worried about they
[3337.20 - 3340.64] can have fatigue animal protein person
[3339.44 - 3342.08] can have lots of fatigue and a
[3340.64 - 3343.84] plant-based person can have lots of
[3342.08 - 3345.36] fatigue
[3343.84 - 3347.92] okay
[3345.36 - 3349.76] i'm waiting for the cookies to kind of
[3347.92 - 3351.92] get nice and toasty in here and they're
[3349.76 - 3355.20] just about done i guess another couple
[3351.92 - 3355.20] minutes we're almost there
[3359.12 - 3365.76] we get lost and we run back and forth
[3363.28 - 3367.52] you can still heal eating animal protein
[3365.76 - 3369.28] and you can still heal eat being
[3367.52 - 3372.00] plant-based okay
[3369.28 - 3373.20] you could still heal being plant-based
[3372.00 - 3374.96] right
[3373.20 - 3376.56] anybody who's plant-based or vegan i
[3374.96 - 3378.24] recommend staying plant-based but
[3376.56 - 3380.48] learning how to do it anybody who wants
[3378.24 - 3381.84] to be animal protein you know what you
[3380.48 - 3385.12] can heal too
[3381.84 - 3385.12] just got to learn how to do it
[3387.20 - 3390.48] another thing too you could be on a
[3388.80 - 3392.24] plant-based vegan diet and eat a lot of
[3390.48 - 3393.68] junk food
[3392.24 - 3395.60] definitely can eat a lot of junk food
[3393.68 - 3397.36] you could do a vegan cheese
[3395.60 - 3399.20] that vegan cheese is rough on the system
[3397.36 - 3400.72] if you're trying to heal it's really
[3399.20 - 3401.84] hard on the system if you're trying to
[3400.72 - 3404.72] heal
[3401.84 - 3408.08] it's just as bad as the regular cheese
[3404.72 - 3410.24] in so many ways so keep that in mind
[3408.08 - 3412.32] right
[3410.24 - 3413.76] michelle l says if you take the wrong
[3412.32 - 3415.76] b12
[3413.76 - 3418.16] it won't absorb
[3415.76 - 3419.44] and it's true the details matter
[3418.16 - 3421.44] everything matters you can be a
[3419.44 - 3423.28] plant-based vegan person and thinking
[3421.44 - 3425.60] you're missing b12 somehow and take the
[3423.28 - 3427.44] wrong b12 and not get better
[3425.60 - 3429.68] the right b12 matters
[3427.44 - 3431.52] you guys know i use the vimergy b12
[3429.68 - 3432.48] that's the one i use and and i'm not
[3431.52 - 3434.16] sponsored
[3432.48 - 3436.72] but the stuff is the best it's a
[3434.16 - 3438.00] vimergy.com if you want the best b12
[3436.72 - 3439.76] since michelle
[3438.00 - 3441.76] was talking about it
[3439.76 - 3443.60] so
[3441.76 - 3445.20] i think what happens is the minute you
[3443.60 - 3446.72] get sick
[3445.20 - 3449.12] somebody gets sick and they're a newbie
[3446.72 - 3450.80] and they're not seasoned
[3449.12 - 3452.96] all they need is to hear a doctor or
[3450.80 - 3454.40] somebody say hey get off your bad foods
[3452.96 - 3455.84] meaning get off the junk foods and the
[3454.40 - 3459.04] processed foods and then everybody
[3455.84 - 3460.96] thinks they're they got it all sewed up
[3459.04 - 3464.08] but that's not reality
[3460.96 - 3466.40] reality is it's so much deeper than that
[3464.08 - 3468.40] the reason why we're sick is so much
[3466.40 - 3470.08] deeper than that
[3468.40 - 3472.32] and the details matter to how we can
[3470.08 - 3474.16] heal and recover right
[3472.32 - 3476.40] someone's dealing with low iron they're
[3474.16 - 3477.60] having a low iron issue that's viral
[3476.40 - 3479.92] because
[3477.60 - 3481.60] epstein-barr eats iron i talked about
[3479.92 - 3484.32] this for years so that means there's a
[3481.60 - 3486.32] low low-grade viral infection low-grade
[3484.32 - 3488.16] viral infection you'll hear that now
[3486.32 - 3490.56] people say low-grade out there low grade
[3488.16 - 3492.64] viral out there low grade viral
[3490.56 - 3494.80] medical medium information for 35 years
[3492.64 - 3496.16] is low grade viral infection you can
[3494.80 - 3497.92] read medical medium book one and you'll
[3496.16 - 3499.92] see it all through there low grade viral
[3497.92 - 3502.80] infection but
[3499.92 - 3505.84] the low grade viral infection
[3502.80 - 3507.60] is the reason why people have low iron
[3505.84 - 3509.44] because of a low-grade viral infection
[3507.60 - 3511.68] so they have low iron
[3509.44 - 3514.32] the more toxic heavy metal in them and
[3511.68 - 3517.44] the low-grade viral infection the lower
[3514.32 - 3518.88] the iron goes because epstein-barr feeds
[3517.44 - 3521.20] off of iron
[3518.88 - 3522.80] that's how it works so unless you get
[3521.20 - 3524.16] rid of the epstein bar and work on
[3522.80 - 3525.76] getting rid of the epsilon bar and
[3524.16 - 3527.44] breaking it down and getting it out and
[3525.76 - 3530.88] cleaning it up that's the key is
[3527.44 - 3533.68] cleaning that ebv up and getting it out
[3530.88 - 3535.44] your iron can come back up and come back
[3533.68 - 3537.28] up i'm gonna get these cookies out you
[3535.44 - 3539.68] guys

[3618.88 - 3621.52] cookies i'm just going to tell you right
[3620.40 - 3624.16] now
[3621.52 - 3626.00] is there's no oil on these cookies
[3624.16 - 3628.80] that's where we get in trouble
[3626.00 - 3630.64] it's the oil and everything
[3628.80 - 3633.44] it's the fat in everything that's where
[3630.64 - 3636.48] you get in trouble so you're allowed to
[3633.44 - 3636.48] eat a cookie
[3636.88 - 3641.28] when the oil is not inch all drenched
[3639.76 - 3643.12] inside of it in and out of it because
[3641.28 - 3645.36] that's when we get in trouble it's all
[3643.12 - 3649.04] the fats so keep that in mind so these
[3645.36 - 3651.52] aren't insulin resistant creators
[3649.04 - 3653.12] these are diabetic busters you know
[3651.52 - 3655.20] these are the kind of this is the kind
[3653.12 - 3656.48] of food the kind of meal is a fat free
[3655.20 - 3658.48] meal which
[3656.48 - 3661.20] gets rid of diabetes in people that's
[3658.48 - 3663.76] how we get rid of diabetes in people
[3661.20 - 3666.00] that's how we get rid of type 2 diabetes
[3663.76 - 3668.16] is you lower the fats when you lower the
[3666.00 - 3670.48] fats and you have meals that don't that
[3668.16 - 3672.80] aren't drenched in fat then you can get
[3670.48 - 3675.12] rid of the type 2 diabetes
[3672.80 - 3675.12] right
[3678.64 - 3682.40] okay
[3680.64 - 3684.56] if you're really sick if you're dealing
[3682.40 - 3686.32] with some kind of intestinal disorder
