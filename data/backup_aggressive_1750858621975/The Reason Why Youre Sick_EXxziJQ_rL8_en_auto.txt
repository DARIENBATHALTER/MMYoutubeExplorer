[0.12 - 5.12] of propolis pure right here talking
[2.36 - 7.72] about the powers cat's claw the power of
[5.12 - 10.28] total immune why the immune system needs
[7.72 - 12.36] to stay strong how critical that is you
[10.28 - 14.36] hear somebody that's told they're
[12.36 - 16.16] autoimmune what's going on there their
[14.36 - 17.84] immune systems compromised their immune
[16.16 - 20.60] system is breaking down something is
[17.84 - 22.76] wrong with their immune system bottom
[20.60 - 24.92] line people sick all the time then you
[22.76 - 26.60] hear about longevity right why is
[24.92 - 28.24] everybody so interested about longevity
[26.60 - 30.16] how come they're interested in that so
[28.24 - 32.60] much they weren't years and years ago
[30.16 - 34.36] did you know that people just lived did
[32.60 - 36.16] you know they just lived no one was
[34.36 - 38.04] worried about longevity years ago they
[36.16 - 39.96] just lived you lived your life and that
[38.04 - 43.56] was it right now but everybody is
[39.96 - 46.04] freaking out about longevity now you
[43.56 - 47.72] know why everybody's sick everybody's
[46.04 - 49.60] sick and people are dying left and right
[47.72 - 51.76] so people are like oh crap I better pull
[49.60 - 53.28] it together let me check out longevity
[51.76 - 55.24] let me figure out this longevity thing
[53.28 - 58.00] because I just watch family members go
[55.24 - 60.48] down I just watch friends go down
[58.00 - 62.40] strokes this that heart problems
[60.48 - 64.40] sickness all kinds of different things
[62.40 - 66.12] going on cancer whatever it is I'm
[64.40 - 67.36] watching friends go left and right
[66.12 - 68.84] family members that's what people are
[67.36 - 70.16] saying every day out there right now I
[68.84 - 72.40] talk to people and they're like oh my
[70.16 - 74.48] God my friend went my this this person
[72.40 - 76.88] went my family member that's happening
[74.48 - 79.40] out there and everybody's like longevity
[76.88 - 82.20] longevity because everybody's freaking
[79.40 - 84.44] out like what is going on people are
[82.20 - 86.08] sick but years ago people weren't
[84.44 - 88.12] talking about longevity do you know that
[86.08 - 90.36] you just lived your life you lived your
[88.12 - 93.16] life and if you got sick later on or
[90.36 - 95.36] something happened then okay right but
[93.16 - 97.92] now people are just freaking out anyway
[95.36 - 99.32] talking about the immune system what I
[97.92 - 102.08] what I have right here is the vimergy
[99.32 - 104.96] propolis pure that's an experience if
[102.08 - 107.60] you ever ever have an opportunity to
[104.96 - 109.72] have that bottle in your hand and to
[107.60 - 112.56] actually taste it and use it you'll
[109.72 - 114.80] you'll feel the frequency it's unmatched
[112.56 - 117.04] it's unbelievable the frequency that's
[114.80 - 120.28] in there the living corsin that's
[117.04 - 122.64] actually in there so living corsin is in
[120.28 - 124.44] the propolis pure and this is the vimer
[122.64 - 127.12] propolis pure okay if you don't know the
[124.44 - 129.76] company it's V as and Victor i m as in
[127.12 - 131.60] Mary e r g why and you guys know I
[129.76 - 133.32] endorse these guys and it's for a reason
[131.60 - 135.36] because there's nothing like it out
[133.32 - 138.80] there when it comes down to immune
[135.36 - 140.92] system if if I'm if I just go oh
[138.80 - 143.24] whatever don't even bother telling
[140.92 - 146.52] people anymore don't even whatever
[143.24 - 149.20] people get sick out there then that is
[146.52 - 151.44] just that is wrong I have to fight for
[149.20 - 153.48] it I have to tell people what can help
[151.44 - 155.40] them I have to tell them look this is
[153.48 - 157.16] what's going on with your immune system
[155.40 - 159.36] you need a maintenance you need a
[157.16 - 161.72] maintenance plan of some kind that's
[159.36 - 163.72] critical because in the end people are
[161.72 - 165.04] just getting sick they got symptoms and
[163.72 - 168.56] there's a reason and guess what it's
[165.04 - 171.56] because their immune system is breaking
[168.56 - 175.32] down it's because their immune system is
[171.56 - 177.12] falling apart yes let's be honest let's
[175.32 - 179.40] be straight out with it let's call it
[177.12 - 181.24] like it is if someone's sick their
[179.40 - 183.88] immune system system is not functioning
[181.24 - 186.68] properly it was compromised to such a
[183.88 - 189.48] degree that it can't do its job
[186.68 - 191.08] compromised so it actually can't do its
[189.48 - 193.32] job think about that for a minute right
[191.08 - 195.04] there if we're walking around sick and
[193.32 - 196.80] we got aches and pains and Tinkles and
[195.04 - 198.24] numbness and our jaw hurts and our neck
[196.80 - 200.12] hurts and our head hurts and we have
[198.24 - 201.88] migraines and we have restless leg
[200.12 - 204.52] syndrome and planter fasciitis and
[201.88 - 205.84] problems with our feet we got fungus all
[204.52 - 209.84] over our
[205.84 - 212.36] feet yeah immune system you got toenail
[209.84 - 214.72] fungus immune system you got fingernail
[212.36 - 217.16] fungus immune system you got anything
[214.72 - 218.92] like that going on immune system if you
[217.16 - 220.52] had Lyme disease if you have this if you
[218.92 - 223.12] have that condition this condition
[220.52 - 224.88] fibromyalgia ra whatever it is
[223.12 - 227.64] autoimmune a thyroid problem of some
[224.88 - 230.08] kind hypothyroidism immune system
[227.64 - 232.00] hyperthyroidism immune system
[230.08 - 234.56] Graves and that's what happens and
[232.00 - 236.72] people don't realize it cysts nodules
[234.56 - 238.92] tumors whatever that's happening inside
[236.72 - 241.28] our body calcification throughout our
[238.92 - 244.92] body kidney weak weaknesses adrenal
[241.28 - 247.68] problems all immune system based think
[244.92 - 250.68] about that for a minute right there okay
[247.68 - 253.24] and if we don't call it like it is and
[250.68 - 254.48] if we play footsies with it because
[253.24 - 256.40] that's what's happening out there I see
[254.48 - 258.12] it every day out there you see all these
[256.40 - 260.12] people out there these coaches and these
[258.12 - 261.92] practitioners and all these gurus out
[260.12 - 264.60] there and they're all playing footsies
[261.92 - 267.24] with people yeah you can have longevity
[264.60 - 269.32] just go and take this and do this oh you
[267.24 - 271.60] can have this but nobody's calling it
[269.32 - 274.60] like it it is and saying the immune
[271.60 - 276.84] system is compromised in this world in
[274.60 - 278.72] people's Health the immune system is
[276.84 - 280.28] actually falling apart that's why people
[278.72 - 282.64] are having autoimmune in all these
[280.28 - 285.16] different symptoms and conditions and if
[282.64 - 286.64] we don't address the immune system if we
[285.16 - 288.88] don't want to know what's bothering our
[286.64 - 289.96] immune system that's one thing and we're
[288.88 - 291.60] going to cover that and that's what
[289.96 - 293.60] we're talking about today if we don't
[291.60 - 295.80] want to know what's bothering our immune
[293.60 - 298.56] system which is antagonizing our immune
[295.80 - 301.24] system we actually have to at least know
[298.56 - 304.72] how to protect our immune system or keep
[301.24 - 307.04] it strong and help rebuild it if we want
[304.72 - 309.04] to be in the dark about what's causing
[307.04 - 312.08] our immune system problems it's one
[309.04 - 313.80] thing we have to at least not be in the
[312.08 - 316.12] dark and actually support our immune
[313.80 - 317.36] system and do what we need to do so
[316.12 - 319.28] right here in front of me I got the
[317.36 - 321.36] propolis pure right there okay I was
[319.28 - 324.56] telling you guys yesterday about mouth
[321.36 - 327.28] ulcers oral health so many people are
[324.56 - 328.56] obviously into oral health they're
[327.28 - 330.52] worried about their mouth they're
[328.56 - 333.12] worried about their teeth and their gums
[330.52 - 334.88] they're worried about their tongue yeah
[333.12 - 336.40] their tongue there's people out there
[334.88 - 338.36] and they're scraping their tongue and
[336.40 - 339.92] they're doing all this on their tongue
[338.36 - 341.20] and they got sores on their tongue that
[339.92 - 342.64] they don't understand they feel
[341.20 - 343.72] something in the roof of their mouth and
[342.64 - 345.80] they're playing with their tongue all
[343.72 - 347.80] the time because and they're feeling
[345.80 - 349.52] teeth and they're feeling their gums and
[347.80 - 351.36] like what's wrong here what's wrong
[349.52 - 352.92] there they go to the dentist they go to
[351.36 - 354.80] the doctor they're looking at their
[352.92 - 356.52] mouth and then they're checking their
[354.80 - 357.72] stools and checking everything else
[356.52 - 359.76] they're like well I don't know if you
[357.72 - 362.28] got thrush or this or mouth ulcers or or
[359.76 - 363.88] canker saurs people with oral health
[362.28 - 365.88] they're swishing around coconut oil as
[363.88 - 367.20] if that's going to do anything and I
[365.88 - 368.76] talked about that and I've written about
[367.20 - 370.56] that in the medical medium books where
[368.76 - 372.32] it doesn't do anything and now people
[370.56 - 374.80] are actually poaching that info and
[372.32 - 376.44] they're like yeah bacteria is on their
[374.80 - 378.52] teeth and gums and coating it with
[376.44 - 381.16] coconut oil doesn't stop the bacteria
[378.52 - 383.16] from eating away the teeth and gums
[381.16 - 385.52] medical medium
[383.16 - 388.28] information the point is with propolis
[385.52 - 391.64] pure it's for oral health big part of
[388.28 - 393.96] your immune system is your mouth it's
[391.64 - 397.12] your mouth that's a big part of your
[393.96 - 399.92] immune system and so that's why propolis
[397.12 - 403.48] is so critical I just saw somebody it's
[399.92 - 406.04] viy vimergy.com V is in Victor i m is in
[403.48 - 407.48] Mary E RG y so that's propolis pure I'll
[406.04 - 409.00] talking about that and probably we'll
[407.48 - 411.60] talk more about it and then you got the
[409.00 - 413.04] cats claw which we can go into so let's
[411.60 - 415.44] let's get into our immune system a
[413.04 - 417.24] little bit I want to do a little bit
[415.44 - 419.04] more of the bloodstream right here okay
[417.24 - 420.36] you guys little bit more of the
[419.04 - 422.48] bloodstream
[420.36 - 426.12] all right there it is your
[422.48 - 429.12] bloodstream okay right and in your
[426.12 - 430.00] bloodstream okay you have your blood
[429.12 - 432.52] there it
[430.00 - 436.40] is inside your
[432.52 - 440.20] bloodstream all right your bloodstreams
[436.40 - 443.56] moving you got immune cells you got
[440.20 - 446.32] immune cells in here in your
[443.56 - 449.68] bloodstream these immune cells travel
[446.32 - 454.24] with your blood many of them swim up
[449.68 - 457.12] stream that's right many of them swim
[454.24 - 460.64] upstream a lot of immune cells have the
[457.12 - 462.44] ability to swim isn't that interesting
[460.64 - 466.08] they can travel on their own Propel
[462.44 - 468.52] themselves on their own now in order to
[466.08 - 472.40] stay healthy throughout your life it's
[468.52 - 473.96] more than just hey you know uh let me
[472.40 - 475.32] support my immune system it's more than
[473.96 - 476.88] that it's also understanding what your
[475.32 - 479.12] immune system is even doing because you
[476.88 - 482.36] need to connect to it critical to
[479.12 - 484.36] connect to your immune cells and so
[482.36 - 486.36] knowing that your immune cells sit
[484.36 - 489.84] inside your bloodstream and they swim
[486.36 - 492.36] Downstream on the river in the river and
[489.84 - 494.56] some of them swim upstream against the
[492.36 - 498.32] current okay so I want to show you what
[494.56 - 500.28] happens so this is going this is going
[498.32 - 501.52] right that's your that's your direction
[500.28 - 504.00] that's your stream I'm just going to
[501.52 - 506.48] show you right here it's going this way
[504.00 - 509.24] check this out this is really
[506.48 - 510.12] interesting okay you got immune cells
[509.24 - 512.32] right
[510.12 - 513.76] here and in your bloodstream you got
[512.32 - 515.64] immune cells that are traveling with
[513.76 - 518.44] your blood and they're going this way
[515.64 - 519.92] they're going in this direction okay but
[518.44 - 521.44] then you have immune cells that are
[519.92 - 524.40] going the opposite direction why would
[521.44 - 527.44] they do that why would immune Cells Go
[524.40 - 529.60] the opposite direction you ready for
[527.44 - 532.00] this they're going the opposite
[529.60 - 533.96] direction because they're looking out
[532.00 - 536.76] for
[533.96 - 539.76] Invaders they're looking out for
[536.76 - 541.56] Invaders so your immune cells many of
[539.76 - 543.08] them will swim the opposite direction
[541.56 - 544.68] look at this you see the arrow going the
[543.08 - 546.88] opposite direction you guys your
[544.68 - 549.36] bloodstreams going this
[546.88 - 552.36] direction you got immune cells that are
[549.36 - 555.56] actually going the opposite direction
[552.36 - 558.20] interesting they have power strength
[555.56 - 562.08] they can do that and they usually do
[558.20 - 565.20] that by do walking the lining of your
[562.08 - 567.20] veins and arteries see this now what
[565.20 - 568.80] happens is the reason why they go the
[567.20 - 570.68] other direction is because they're
[568.80 - 572.28] trying to stop something and catch
[570.68 - 575.60] something you
[572.28 - 577.52] ready they're trying to catch something
[575.60 - 582.24] they're trying to catch an
[577.52 - 585.16] Invader okay that's right viruses and
[582.24 - 587.84] any bacteria here it is you got the
[585.16 - 591.88] viruses coming through and the bacteria
[587.84 - 595.00] look at this okay check that out
[591.88 - 598.16] pathogens they're trying to stop
[595.00 - 600.40] pathogens the Invaders so your immune
[598.16 - 604.12] Cells Go go
[600.40 - 606.80] backwards they actually go backwards
[604.12 - 609.20] because they need to it's critical that
[606.80 - 610.92] they try to stop the Invaders when
[609.20 - 613.32] they're actually swimming Upstream when
[610.92 - 616.04] they're swimming sorry Downstream with
[613.32 - 618.84] your bloodstream like that Invaders like
[616.04 - 620.64] to go with the stream of your blood they
[618.84 - 622.96] like to travel with the stream of your
[620.64 - 626.12] blood that's how the Epstein bar the
[622.96 - 628.60] hhv6 the ceglar virus the herpes simplex
[626.12 - 632.00] one herpes simplex 2 the shingles all
[628.60 - 634.44] the HHS that are undiscovered HH uh V10
[632.00 - 636.68] through 16 right that medical be
[634.44 - 639.48] information talks about and all the
[636.68 - 641.24] different variations the 100 varieties
[639.48 - 643.40] of EPC bar because the varieties are
[641.24 - 645.56] expanding every single day it's not it's
[643.40 - 648.36] no longer 60 varieties like I've
[645.56 - 650.00] actually put in the books it's way more
[648.36 - 652.84] now and it's the same thing with
[650.00 - 655.00] shingles okay all those bugs and viruses
[652.84 - 658.12] are partly responsible for why your
[655.00 - 660.00] immune system is giving up on people and
[658.12 - 663.40] that's a good point is it giving up is
[660.00 - 667.32] it not no it's not it's fighting like
[663.40 - 671.56] hell it's fighting hard so what happens
[667.32 - 673.48] is your immune cells they walk backwards
[671.56 - 676.08] because you're trying to stop the
[673.48 - 678.52] pathogens that are in the bloodstream
[676.08 - 681.60] the reason why they go backwards is they
[678.52 - 684.04] battle head on with the pathogen as the
[681.60 - 685.56] pathogen is coming in head on collision
[684.04 - 687.60] so that's what they do it's like a car
[685.56 - 690.08] going down the highway and somebody
[687.60 - 692.24] getting on the wrong exit and coming
[690.08 - 694.52] back on the highway and here we go we
[692.24 - 696.68] got a car coming down at 70 M an hour
[694.52 - 698.96] and then we got right we got another car
[696.68 - 700.16] coming up at 70 M an hour totally
[698.96 - 702.92] confused doesn't know they're on the
[700.16 - 706.64] wrong side of the highway and then they
[702.92 - 709.40] crash same thing the immune cells are
[706.64 - 712.68] actually going Upstream the pathogens
[709.40 - 715.96] are cruising Downstream and then they
[712.68 - 717.56] crash that's how it's done the reason
[715.96 - 720.12] why it's done like that is immune cells
[717.56 - 722.04] have a difficult time fighting pathogens
[720.12 - 724.52] while they're all swimming Downstream at
[722.04 - 726.88] the same time very important to know why
[724.52 - 729.68] is it important it's part of connecting
[726.88 - 732.16] to our immune system every little bit we
[729.68 - 734.24] know strengthens the immune system so
[732.16 - 735.84] when you fortify it you're not only just
[734.24 - 738.52] fortifying it with tools like the
[735.84 - 740.68] propolis pure right propolis and the
[738.52 - 743.20] Kats claw and the total immune which is
[740.68 - 744.36] Molen in time you're not just fortifying
[743.20 - 746.72] your immune cells which we're going to
[744.36 - 748.84] cover in a minute you're actually
[746.72 - 750.28] connecting you're you're understanding
[748.84 - 752.80] what you're immune cells are trying to
[750.28 - 754.96] accomplish the Consciousness Connection
[752.80 - 758.04] matters because our immune system can
[754.96 - 760.12] talk to our Consciousness they can work
[758.04 - 764.48] together very important
[760.12 - 768.88] here so as Invaders are going Downstream
[764.48 - 771.80] like this you got immune cells walking
[768.88 - 774.68] Upstream to try to crash into them it's
[771.80 - 777.00] a surprise attack on the Invader The
[774.68 - 779.60] Invader doesn't expect it as it's
[777.00 - 782.24] cruising around going down the street it
[779.60 - 784.96] doesn't expect a surprise attack a car
[782.24 - 786.44] coming up the highway the wrong way you
[784.96 - 788.08] don't expect that either if you're on
[786.44 - 790.56] the highway and a car comes on the exit
[788.08 - 791.84] the wrong way and and is going up the
[790.56 - 794.64] highway while you're going down the
[791.84 - 797.48] highway you're not expecting it and then
[794.64 - 800.96] boom that's how it works the immune
[797.48 - 803.80] cells know in your body that the Invader
[800.96 - 807.72] the Epstein bar yes the shingles the
[803.80 - 810.52] hhv6 is not expecting a headon
[807.72 - 813.32] collision that's how how it's done but
[810.52 - 815.28] in order you're ready for this in order
[813.32 - 818.36] for your immune cells to have the
[815.28 - 821.20] strength strength it needs to swim
[818.36 - 824.28] upstream it needs to be
[821.20 - 827.12] fed it needs to be supported it's why
[824.28 - 830.88] it's critical to have a
[827.12 - 833.56] maintenance critical not just a onetime
[830.88 - 835.84] thing like I'll take this one year for a
[833.56 - 840.80] month and that's it or I'll take this
[835.84 - 843.96] for a week it needs support all the time
[840.80 - 847.88] a maintenance support so it can keep its
[843.96 - 851.16] strength up now somebody somebody might
[847.88 - 853.24] have a weakened immune system so when
[851.16 - 855.88] pathogens are going Downstream here we
[853.24 - 857.24] go pathogens are going Downstream right
[855.88 - 859.60] there they go going
[857.24 - 863.56] Downstream as they're going Downstream
[859.60 - 866.08] your immune cells can't walk back they
[863.56 - 869.56] don't have the strength to actually walk
[866.08 - 872.92] back they can't do the surprise element
[869.56 - 875.12] the surprise attack is not easy for them
[872.92 - 876.20] they can't do the head-on collision and
[875.12 - 878.00] because they can't do the head-on
[876.20 - 880.16] collision there you go you break out in
[878.00 - 882.36] shingles finally in your life you break
[880.16 - 884.40] out shingles or there you go you have a
[882.36 - 887.04] non rashing shingles and that non-
[884.40 - 888.68] rashing shingles is kicking your butt
[887.04 - 889.92] and you got pain everywhere in your body
[888.68 - 891.68] and you're hurting all kinds of ways
[889.92 - 893.96] your tongue your tongue hurts it's
[891.68 - 897.84] buzzing it's tingling it's numb your
[893.96 - 899.80] body hurts and that's how it goes or you
[897.84 - 901.72] got trigeminal neuralgic because your
[899.80 - 903.32] herpes simplex one is going out of
[901.72 - 905.44] control and it's getting into the
[903.32 - 907.56] trigeminal nerve or the shingles virus
[905.44 - 909.92] is getting into the trigeminal nerve if
[907.56 - 912.32] we don't do a maintenance and take care
[909.92 - 915.16] of our immune system you guys what
[912.32 - 917.36] happens is your immune cells they lose
[915.16 - 919.52] their strength and they can't do the
[917.36 - 922.76] head-on collision
[919.52 - 925.92] backwards they can't they can't do the
[922.76 - 927.96] surprise element the surprise attack
[925.92 - 931.24] which is the
[927.96 - 934.36] pathogen is Flowing Downstream nice and
[931.24 - 937.92] fast here it is and when a pathogen
[934.36 - 940.68] flows Downstream get ready for
[937.92 - 943.56] this it stays
[940.68 - 946.56] strong when a pathogen like an Epstein
[943.56 - 949.44] bar virus or any kind of bacteria strep
[946.56 - 952.72] bacteria when it flows Downstream with
[949.44 - 955.04] the river of your blood it stays nice
[952.72 - 958.04] and strong the reason why it stays nice
[955.04 - 960.68] and strong because it doesn't have to do
[958.04 - 964.16] anything it's flowing with the river but
[960.68 - 966.32] your immune cells they have to work hard
[964.16 - 968.56] and they need strength they need a
[966.32 - 970.80] maintenance for strength because they
[968.56 - 973.52] have to go upstream and when the immune
[970.80 - 976.56] Cells Go Upstream it takes so much
[973.52 - 978.92] energy and so much strength and they
[976.56 - 982.04] need that strength so when your Epstein
[978.92 - 985.64] bar leaves your liver because it's going
[982.04 - 989.04] for hay mononucleosis again it's going
[985.64 - 990.76] for hey another another infection low
[989.04 - 992.96] grade infection it's going again for
[990.76 - 995.00] another high grade infection your epine
[992.96 - 996.76] VAR here it goes you've been under
[995.00 - 999.24] stress all kinds of problems you got
[996.76 - 1001.08] exposure exposure to poisons and toxins
[999.24 - 1003.96] and chemicals or whatever it is and here
[1001.08 - 1006.60] it is there goes your epscene bar it's
[1003.96 - 1008.28] flowing Downstream guess what it has all
[1006.60 - 1010.40] the strength in the world because it
[1008.28 - 1012.88] doesn't have to do anything it's flowing
[1010.40 - 1014.92] with the stream right and guess what
[1012.88 - 1017.64] it's doing it's feeding on all kinds of
[1014.92 - 1019.80] poisons and crap and toxins and all
[1017.64 - 1021.72] kinds of garbage in your blood and it's
[1019.80 - 1024.60] having a field day A Feast while it's
[1021.72 - 1026.68] swimming Downstream just relaxing and
[1024.60 - 1029.76] flowing Downstream and then your immune
[1026.68 - 1031.80] cells right here see these they have to
[1029.76 - 1033.84] go the opposite way they have to have
[1031.80 - 1036.44] strength they have to have stamina and
[1033.84 - 1037.60] they have to go the opposite way to do a
[1036.44 - 1040.36] head-on
[1037.60 - 1042.92] collision with that virus or that
[1040.36 - 1045.28] pathogen so your immune Cells Go
[1042.92 - 1048.00] Downstream go upstream and they go
[1045.28 - 1050.40] against the current and then they crash
[1048.00 - 1052.04] right there with that pathogen and they
[1050.40 - 1053.72] need strength and that's why they need a
[1052.04 - 1055.12] maintenance because people's immune
[1053.72 - 1057.08] systems are breaking down they're
[1055.12 - 1059.20] weakened every single day and as they're
[1057.08 - 1062.36] weakened and broken down guess what our
[1059.20 - 1064.80] immune cells can't go Upstream easy in
[1062.36 - 1068.04] fact a lot of people their immune cells
[1064.80 - 1069.96] can't go Upstream at all can't even they
[1068.04 - 1072.28] don't even have the strength to go
[1069.96 - 1074.64] Upstream at all and so if we're not
[1072.28 - 1077.52] doing something if we're not feeding our
[1074.64 - 1079.44] immune cells and strengthening them and
[1077.52 - 1081.92] knocking pathogens down
[1079.44 - 1083.92] ourselves we can get in trouble 10
[1081.92 - 1085.84] symptoms now we got 20 symptoms yeah
[1083.92 - 1087.96] that's right now you got 30 symptoms a
[1085.84 - 1089.60] lot of people have 100 symptoms they can
[1087.96 - 1092.08] count them they have them they they
[1089.60 - 1094.20] actually Journal them I have a pain in
[1092.08 - 1096.00] my jaw that just came back again I got a
[1094.20 - 1097.84] ringing in my ear that just came back
[1096.00 - 1099.64] again I got ringing in both ears that's
[1097.84 - 1101.28] another symptom I have I was a little
[1099.64 - 1103.20] dizzy the other day that's another
[1101.28 - 1106.32] symptom I had a panic attack that's
[1103.20 - 1107.16] another symptom they add up real quick
[1106.32 - 1109.28] real
[1107.16 - 1111.76] quick love and healing says over there
[1109.28 - 1114.40] in IG I haven't been sick longer than 2
[1111.76 - 1116.84] days because of vimergy supplements in
[1114.40 - 1118.80] the last 3 and a half years along with
[1116.84 - 1121.84] medical mean and Protocols of course
[1118.80 - 1124.56] it's so amazing now I look I give a lot
[1121.84 - 1127.48] of credit a lot of credit to a really
[1124.56 - 1130.28] high powered good supplement okay I give
[1127.48 - 1132.12] a lot of credit to that I do when it's
[1130.28 - 1134.52] one that actually works and I know it's
[1132.12 - 1137.08] as pure and clean as it is a lot of
[1134.52 - 1139.68] credit to it and I've seen that propolis
[1137.08 - 1141.60] right here I've seen this perform things
[1139.68 - 1143.72] like certain Miracles with people that
[1141.60 - 1145.88] are just mindblowing that's what I've
[1143.72 - 1147.48] seen okay same thing with the cat's claw
[1145.88 - 1150.16] that's another one right there too and
[1147.48 - 1153.52] the total immune as well really
[1150.16 - 1157.32] Incredible God was with us last night
[1153.52 - 1159.84] our home was hit by a tornado storm
[1157.32 - 1163.36] sounded like a train coming through our
[1159.84 - 1165.24] house so much work to be done but so
[1163.36 - 1168.12] thankful and blessed I healed with
[1165.24 - 1170.80] medical medium to handle it first of all
[1168.12 - 1173.12] look God bless you and I'm so sorry sole
[1170.80 - 1176.00] purpose with Sarah I'm so sorry you
[1173.12 - 1178.44] actually have gone through that I've
[1176.00 - 1181.56] been in some storms I've been in some
[1178.44 - 1183.84] hurricanes I've been in a tornado right
[1181.56 - 1186.52] not as close as that not as close as
[1183.84 - 1190.00] that we I haven't been in one in that
[1186.52 - 1192.96] the way you have um Sarah that's that's
[1190.00 - 1195.88] terrifying okay I've been in hurricanes
[1192.96 - 1198.00] really bad ones and been in the uh the
[1195.88 - 1200.28] the Eye of Hur hurricanes but not
[1198.00 - 1203.24] tornado have been near tornadoes but
[1200.28 - 1205.48] that's scary and and incredible that you
[1203.24 - 1207.32] actually have the strength now to power
[1205.48 - 1209.04] through that so I'm talking about the
[1207.32 - 1210.76] immune system if you guys just got on
[1209.04 - 1213.72] here why it's critical for maintenance
[1210.76 - 1215.40] and what our immune system does lay over
[1213.72 - 1217.96] there on YouTube since I am doing your
[1215.40 - 1221.68] protocols I am not sick every month
[1217.96 - 1224.40] before my menstration so that that's
[1221.68 - 1226.92] interesting BEC that's so powerful what
[1224.40 - 1229.16] happens is menstruation knocks the
[1226.92 - 1231.36] immune system down naturally because a
[1229.16 - 1234.08] woman's immune system has to go to the
[1231.36 - 1236.04] reproductive system during menstration
[1234.08 - 1238.56] and so it leaves less of an immune
[1236.04 - 1240.32] system other places so women get all
[1238.56 - 1241.92] kinds of different symptoms before
[1240.32 - 1243.68] menstration during menstration and
[1241.92 - 1245.48] shortly after they get all kinds of
[1243.68 - 1247.72] symptoms they get all kinds of things
[1245.48 - 1249.92] that happen and so your immune system
[1247.72 - 1252.84] strengthening that means the 20% of your
[1249.92 - 1254.44] immune system that is still everywhere
[1252.84 - 1257.08] else during your menstration it's
[1254.44 - 1259.44] stronger it's stronger than what it used
[1257.08 - 1262.40] to be so you actually not getting sick
[1259.44 - 1264.04] before menstruation means that the the
[1262.40 - 1267.00] part of your immune system that's
[1264.04 - 1269.24] handling everything else is actually
[1267.00 - 1271.80] stronger than it used to be that's
[1269.24 - 1273.76] powerful that's incredible so we're
[1271.80 - 1276.60] talking about the bloodstream the
[1273.76 - 1280.56] bloodstream flows right the river that
[1276.60 - 1284.88] flows okay and in that River all
[1280.56 - 1287.56] right pathogens and toxins flow
[1284.88 - 1290.44] Downstream that's what they do because
[1287.56 - 1293.60] the reason why pathogens flow
[1290.44 - 1296.28] Downstream is so the pathogen doesn't
[1293.60 - 1299.40] have to use strength and energy keeps
[1296.28 - 1303.04] the pathogen nice and strong so the
[1299.40 - 1306.92] pathogen flows right
[1303.04 - 1309.04] Downstream just like this with the blood
[1306.92 - 1310.96] pathogen flows Downstream just like this
[1309.04 - 1313.04] with the blood okay it makes it so the
[1310.96 - 1315.32] pathogen doesn't have to expel any
[1313.04 - 1318.92] energy it makes it so the pathogen
[1315.32 - 1320.96] doesn't have to weaken okay immune cell
[1318.92 - 1323.16] in order to have the surprise element
[1320.96 - 1326.16] and the surprise attack your immune
[1323.16 - 1330.24] Cells Go Upstream like I was saying
[1326.16 - 1333.92] before the goal surprise attack on the
[1330.24 - 1336.60] pathogen slam the pathogen head on and
[1333.92 - 1339.04] engulf the pathogen so here's how it
[1336.60 - 1341.76] works your immune cells are supposed to
[1339.04 - 1343.60] devour a pathogen keep this in mind
[1341.76 - 1346.84] there's your immune Cell It's supposed
[1343.60 - 1349.52] to engulf a pathogen like eat it up and
[1346.84 - 1351.88] devour it so you're immune cell is
[1349.52 - 1354.52] supposed to actually engulf the pathogen
[1351.88 - 1357.24] so the pathogen is gone right check that
[1354.52 - 1360.00] out this is interesting
[1357.24 - 1362.56] now guess how guess what helps your
[1360.00 - 1366.52] immune cell to engulf a
[1362.56 - 1368.52] pathogen headon Collision going Upstream
[1366.52 - 1370.32] while the pathogen is going Downstream
[1368.52 - 1372.88] you ready for this here's your immune
[1370.32 - 1374.96] cell it's going Upstream it needs the
[1372.88 - 1377.96] strength to swim upstream here it's
[1374.96 - 1380.84] going pathogen is going Downstream boom
[1377.96 - 1383.64] as they Li your white blood cell tries
[1380.84 - 1386.96] to engulf the pathogen in one shot
[1383.64 - 1386.96] swallowing and devouring
[1387.68 - 1394.12] it and all that is fine and
[1391.12 - 1396.96] dandy if your immune cells have the
[1394.12 - 1398.68] strength to do it because they're
[1396.96 - 1403.00] supposed to do that so you don't get the
[1398.68 - 1406.64] next flare so you don't have a new
[1403.00 - 1408.92] flare a flare up that's right so now
[1406.64 - 1410.84] you're all flared up
[1408.92 - 1412.72] you need the strong immune system the
[1410.84 - 1415.28] immune cells need to have that strength
[1412.72 - 1418.36] so when they go head on like that they
[1415.28 - 1420.80] engulf that immune that that the immune
[1418.36 - 1422.60] cell engulfs that pathogen that virus
[1420.80 - 1425.52] like the Epstein bar the hhv6 the
[1422.60 - 1427.64] shingles C cegal virus
[1425.52 - 1430.92] HPV even
[1427.64 - 1432.60] HPV hpylori
[1430.92 - 1436.60] bacteria
[1432.60 - 1440.24] strep other bacteria and engulfs it and
[1436.60 - 1443.44] devours it because it goes upstream and
[1440.24 - 1447.72] it hits it head on and when it hits it
[1443.44 - 1450.12] head on it can swallow it inlf it it can
[1447.72 - 1452.28] go right through its membrane into the
[1450.12 - 1454.72] immune cell and then it can actually eat
[1452.28 - 1457.40] that pathogen and explode it and kill it
[1454.72 - 1460.84] but you got to have a maintenance you
[1457.40 - 1462.68] got to be doing things to be feeding
[1460.84 - 1465.80] your immune cells and keeping them
[1462.68 - 1467.32] strong that's what's critical Max vond
[1465.80 - 1469.04] over there on YouTube hey how you doing
[1467.32 - 1472.56] wow I have a new respect for my immune
[1469.04 - 1474.44] cells and that respect is the connection
[1472.56 - 1475.88] that's the whole point you got to have
[1474.44 - 1477.64] that connection to your immune cells and
[1475.88 - 1480.24] know what they're doing so that when you
[1477.64 - 1483.64] support it you're supporting it slim
[1480.24 - 1487.52] over there on IG I've been on celery
[1483.64 - 1490.24] juice nice I've been on celery juice HMT
[1487.52 - 1494.40] hmds since August and it's been
[1490.24 - 1498.88] lifechanging brain fog Gone Gone
[1494.40 - 1501.76] ADHD amazing totally off Aderall
[1498.88 - 1507.36] boom thyroid medication almost
[1501.76 - 1510.56] completely off boom thank you aw and
[1507.36 - 1513.32] so incredible I just got to sit with
[1510.56 - 1516.00] that for a second is that okay you guys
[1513.32 - 1519.32] because think about think about his
[1516.00 - 1521.60] journey think about his journey it's
[1519.32 - 1523.64] incredible
[1521.60 - 1526.40] incredible having this connection to our
[1523.64 - 1528.88] immune cells means a lot because it
[1526.40 - 1531.28] helps us keep on track it helps us
[1528.88 - 1534.32] realize what our immune cells have to do
[1531.28 - 1537.08] how how hard they work having this
[1534.32 - 1539.64] understanding is a big deal right and
[1537.08 - 1541.76] then being able to fortify our AB it's
[1539.64 - 1543.64] one thing to say you know because I I
[1541.76 - 1544.84] look I talked to Spirit of compassion
[1543.64 - 1547.16] and I'm like well I tell people about
[1544.84 - 1550.84] their immune system I'm only human I'm
[1547.16 - 1554.36] doing my best I'm I'm only I'm doing my
[1550.84 - 1556.84] best I have all these books I'm out
[1554.36 - 1559.12] there talking about the immune system
[1556.84 - 1564.44] Spirit I'm trying my
[1559.12 - 1569.28] best what more can I do and so is like
[1564.44 - 1571.60] explain the immune system talk about it
[1569.28 - 1573.72] show people what their immune cell is
[1571.60 - 1575.40] actually doing and have them connect to
[1573.72 - 1577.88] it so they can get out of chronic
[1575.40 - 1580.48] illness survive their chronic
[1577.88 - 1583.40] illnesses because the immune system is
[1580.48 - 1586.48] under respected
[1583.40 - 1589.16] undervalued and so is like underr it
[1586.48 - 1591.84] undervalued immune systems
[1589.16 - 1594.88] taken for granted we take our immune
[1591.84 - 1596.52] cells for granted and you know what even
[1594.88 - 1599.12] when we get sick people take it for
[1596.52 - 1600.92] granted and they still do and so it's
[1599.12 - 1603.16] critical to know how it works what's
[1600.92 - 1605.56] going on and what's supportive so what
[1603.16 - 1607.12] can we do about it first of all you know
[1605.56 - 1609.76] you want to avoid all the different
[1607.12 - 1611.64] toxins the best you can throw out the
[1609.76 - 1613.72] air fresheners throw out the scented
[1611.64 - 1616.08] candles get rid of the Clones get rid of
[1613.72 - 1617.72] the perfumes get rid of the fabric
[1616.08 - 1619.64] softeners that are blowing out all that
[1617.72 - 1621.24] chemical get rid of all the detergents
[1619.64 - 1624.40] that are blowing out all that chemical
[1621.24 - 1626.44] right be cautious which with bleach be
[1624.40 - 1629.40] cautious if you're if you're a bleach
[1626.44 - 1633.44] user that's an immune system
[1629.40 - 1637.20] dropper you smell bleach immune system
[1633.44 - 1639.80] drops you smell bleach it gets in you
[1637.20 - 1642.64] immune system drops
[1639.80 - 1645.44] bleach yes
[1642.64 - 1647.44] right bleach actually meaning you know
[1645.44 - 1649.60] what I mean any kind of thing like that
[1647.44 - 1652.56] chlorine
[1649.60 - 1655.08] you know anything like that immune
[1652.56 - 1657.72] system drops and that's important to
[1655.08 - 1660.00] know how it works these people don't
[1657.72 - 1661.32] realize it they you know they smell
[1660.00 - 1662.72] things and they don't know what those
[1661.32 - 1664.64] things are doing okay when you're
[1662.72 - 1666.60] filling your tank try to look for the
[1664.64 - 1668.84] breeze that's going the opposite way go
[1666.60 - 1670.32] on the other side of the the nozzle you
[1668.84 - 1671.28] know when you're holding that nozzle and
[1670.32 - 1673.52] you're breathing in all that
[1671.28 - 1675.24] petrochemical and everything try to kind
[1673.52 - 1677.00] of stand back a little bit if you can
[1675.24 - 1678.32] set the nozzle you set the nozzle and
[1677.00 - 1681.04] you stand back a little bit while it's
[1678.32 - 1683.52] filling or trying to get kind of like
[1681.04 - 1686.64] away from the the fumes that are coming
[1683.52 - 1688.64] into you that lowers the immune system
[1686.64 - 1690.88] don't get your carpets
[1688.64 - 1693.56] cleaned you get your carpets cleaned
[1690.88 - 1695.32] with conventional cleaning you know like
[1693.56 - 1698.08] detergents and stuff like that they come
[1695.32 - 1700.12] in that chemical is just going in you
[1698.08 - 1702.16] constantly knowing what your immune
[1700.12 - 1703.80] system is up against is part of the
[1702.16 - 1706.16] problem it's connecting to that being
[1703.80 - 1708.16] aware and proactive keep that in mind so
[1706.16 - 1709.88] you're being proactive because you know
[1708.16 - 1711.44] what your immune system is up against
[1709.88 - 1713.64] that's a big thing so it's about like
[1711.44 - 1715.08] different chemicals now we we might not
[1713.64 - 1717.40] be able to avoid all the chemicals
[1715.08 - 1719.68] falling out of the sky and we we might
[1717.40 - 1721.64] not be able to avoid the cologne that's
[1719.68 - 1723.56] you know someone's living with you and
[1721.64 - 1726.20] they're saturated and we got to breathe
[1723.56 - 1727.84] it in all the time but it's important
[1726.20 - 1730.36] because we can get rid of what we what
[1727.84 - 1734.72] we can get rid of move things away from
[1730.36 - 1736.88] us that that are intoxicating us being
[1734.72 - 1740.56] cautious and that helps the immune
[1736.88 - 1742.84] system okay prevents taking your immune
[1740.56 - 1744.96] system for granted we're aware of it all
[1742.84 - 1746.36] the time it's deeply connected to no
[1744.96 - 1748.68] connecting to no this here's how it
[1746.36 - 1750.72] works if we just say oh yeah I don't
[1748.68 - 1754.20] like scented candles fragrances aren't
[1750.72 - 1755.96] good for you fine if we say fragrances
[1754.20 - 1758.80] are actually challenging our immune
[1755.96 - 1761.40] cells as they go Upstream then we're
[1758.80 - 1763.36] we're not that's not good it's good to
[1761.40 - 1765.48] know that but it's not good to know it's
[1763.36 - 1768.68] not good that it's happening so
[1765.48 - 1771.68] fragrances travel in the bloodstream too
[1768.68 - 1774.20] you smell it on the outside it's on the
[1771.68 - 1775.60] inside you smell cologne you have
[1774.20 - 1778.44] cologne in your
[1775.60 - 1779.76] bloodstream did you know that if you're
[1778.44 - 1781.96] smelling cologne it's in your
[1779.76 - 1783.84] bloodstream if you smell air freshener
[1781.96 - 1785.96] it's in your bloodstream if you smell
[1783.84 - 1788.44] petrochemical coming out of the the gas
[1785.96 - 1790.72] the gas nozzle it's in your bloodstream
[1788.44 - 1793.72] and that that stuff is traveling with
[1790.72 - 1796.36] your bloodstream so pathogens love to
[1793.72 - 1798.40] eat that stuff feed on all those toxins
[1796.36 - 1801.56] and chemicals the pathogens love that
[1798.40 - 1804.40] stuff right but when our immune cells
[1801.56 - 1807.04] right here when they got to walk back
[1804.40 - 1809.08] and swim upstream they're getting
[1807.04 - 1811.84] slammed with all kinds of different
[1809.08 - 1813.68] chemicals our immune cells need to be
[1811.84 - 1815.44] protected so let's talk about how to
[1813.68 - 1817.44] protect that immune cell right there
[1815.44 - 1819.40] here's our immune cells right here okay
[1817.44 - 1822.44] going to draw a few of them right
[1819.40 - 1825.44] here okay we got our immune cells right
[1822.44 - 1827.64] here here they
[1825.44 - 1829.00] are so how does an immune cell get
[1827.64 - 1830.60] stronger
[1829.00 - 1834.52] ER
[1830.60 - 1838.72] okay it gets stronger by being
[1834.52 - 1842.28] fed immune cells feed on phytochemical
[1838.72 - 1845.32] compounds that aren't even detected by
[1842.28 - 1847.60] science and research yet it's going to
[1845.32 - 1849.36] take a trillion dollars and more
[1847.60 - 1851.72] trillions of dollars throughout the next
[1849.36 - 1854.20] hundred years for science and research
[1851.72 - 1858.80] to look into every phytochemical
[1854.20 - 1860.96] compound just a b alone pick up nectar
[1858.80 - 1864.28] and pollen
[1860.96 - 1865.76] somewhere right you're talking about
[1864.28 - 1867.04] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1865.76 - 1868.56] photochemical compounds that are
[1867.04 - 1871.16] undiscovered by science of research just
[1868.56 - 1873.40] from a bee grabbing some
[1871.16 - 1876.36] pollen that's what we're talking about
[1873.40 - 1879.24] our immune system
[1876.36 - 1881.20] okay is gobbling things down that we
[1879.24 - 1884.36] don't even
[1881.20 - 1887.96] understand when you eat
[1884.36 - 1890.60] something okay when you eat something or
[1887.96 - 1893.76] immune cells are taking from that
[1890.60 - 1895.60] food okay when you eat something when
[1893.76 - 1898.84] you eat something our immune cells are
[1895.60 - 1900.64] taking from that food see this you guys
[1898.84 - 1902.72] they're taking things from the food you
[1900.64 - 1905.16] don't know about they're taking things
[1902.72 - 1908.20] from the food no one knows about science
[1905.16 - 1910.56] doesn't know about nothing knows
[1908.20 - 1913.16] about and that's what our immune cells
[1910.56 - 1915.76] doing they're eating things we do not
[1913.16 - 1919.04] have our finger on the pulse of keep
[1915.76 - 1921.28] that in mind that's what immune cell do
[1919.04 - 1925.24] and then when it comes down to powerful
[1921.28 - 1926.64] herbs like Thy like in the total immune
[1925.24 - 1930.48] Thyme and
[1926.64 - 1933.08] Molen those are immune system enhancer
[1930.48 - 1936.64] and Builders because there are things
[1933.08 - 1938.68] constituents in these these herbs like
[1936.64 - 1942.32] Thyme and
[1938.68 - 1944.84] Molen that enter into the immune
[1942.32 - 1948.00] cell very important to
[1944.84 - 1950.68] know and the immune cell gains strength
[1948.00 - 1955.48] and radiate strength
[1950.68 - 1958.36] when that's entering in look immune
[1955.48 - 1960.20] cells gaining strength and vibrancy
[1958.36 - 1962.44] that's how you have to see your immune
[1960.20 - 1965.84] cells you guys see that you need to see
[1962.44 - 1969.36] them strong radiating outward
[1965.84 - 1972.96] right so when you're doing your propolis
[1969.36 - 1976.16] pure envision your immune cells feeding
[1972.96 - 1978.36] off of that propolis pure envision your
[1976.16 - 1980.40] immune cells feeding off of that cat's
[1978.36 - 1983.12] claw the phytochemical compounds and
[1980.40 - 1985.16] cats claw that enhance the immune system
[1983.12 - 1987.32] envision your immune cells feeding off
[1985.16 - 1990.52] of time and
[1987.32 - 1992.48] Mullen and even zinc and restoring and
[1990.52 - 1994.08] strengthening it's easy to get
[1992.48 - 1996.04] distracted out there with so much
[1994.08 - 1999.52] information coming at you all day long
[1996.04 - 2002.12] on social and everything top five this
[1999.52 - 2003.80] top three this for your whatever top
[2002.12 - 2006.04] seven things you can do for your sex
[2003.80 - 2009.52] life top eight things you can do it long
[2006.04 - 2011.84] for longevity number one eat colostrum
[2009.52 - 2015.64] that's not that's no that's not good for
[2011.84 - 2015.64] you it's not good for
[2016.08 - 2021.16] you point is is that what that's what
[2019.48 - 2023.52] we're up against but we don't realize
[2021.16 - 2025.04] what our immune system needs and then we
[2023.52 - 2028.84] don't realize our immune system is
[2025.04 - 2031.44] screwing up how many people get sick
[2028.84 - 2036.08] with a symptom go to the
[2031.44 - 2038.40] doctor an immune system wasn't even
[2036.08 - 2040.12] mentioned even if some someone gets an
[2038.40 - 2042.40] autoimmune
[2040.12 - 2045.40] diagnosis it's not about like your
[2042.40 - 2047.48] immune system needing to heal and get
[2045.40 - 2049.56] stronger and strengthen it's about your
[2047.48 - 2051.56] immune system attacking itself attacking
[2049.56 - 2053.28] your body attacking your organs doesn't
[2051.56 - 2054.96] even make any sense because our immune
[2053.28 - 2056.60] system doesn't attack our own organs
[2054.96 - 2058.04] doesn't attack her own glands that was a
[2056.60 - 2061.76] theory in
[2058.04 - 2064.44] 1950 the point is is our immune
[2061.76 - 2067.32] cells they need strength they need
[2064.44 - 2069.64] Vitality they need energy and we need to
[2067.32 - 2072.44] give them things on a maintenance level
[2069.64 - 2075.28] so they can strengthen so they can swim
[2072.44 - 2078.72] upstream and clobber the pathogens that
[2075.28 - 2081.92] are making everybody sick and toxins and
[2078.72 - 2086.60] pathogens you need that immune cell to
[2081.92 - 2089.20] be strong as an ox to go swim upstream
[2086.60 - 2091.52] why the pathogen is going Downstream
[2089.20 - 2093.60] relaxing it's got its shades on it's
[2091.52 - 2095.76] chilling it's got its lawn chair it's
[2093.60 - 2097.32] just going for a ride that's what the
[2095.76 - 2100.40] upen bar is doing and then your white
[2097.32 - 2102.88] blood's cell needs to collide and Gobble
[2100.40 - 2105.36] it down and engulf it just like
[2102.88 - 2108.24] that order to do that strengthen the
[2105.36 - 2111.72] ammun system you need maintenance stuff
[2108.24 - 2114.36] Julie Tuesday Julie Tuesday 144 I see on
[2111.72 - 2117.24] YouTube all the time a w how can we
[2114.36 - 2119.32] support our bone marrow so that it can
[2117.24 - 2122.20] birth stronger immune
[2119.32 - 2125.08] cells okay getting toxic heavy metals
[2122.20 - 2127.04] out is a big part of that okay all the
[2125.08 - 2129.76] different books on that medical medium
[2127.04 - 2132.52] books right all the different stuff the
[2129.76 - 2134.08] brain saver books okay I'm hiding behind
[2132.52 - 2135.76] here right now if you guys don't mind
[2134.08 - 2140.40] voila here I
[2135.76 - 2143.60] am okay getting the metals out
[2140.40 - 2146.60] strengthens the bone marrow for immune
[2143.60 - 2150.56] Health notice that very interesting
[2146.60 - 2153.52] Spirit of compassion huh yep the
[2150.56 - 2154.92] original heavy metal detox that medical
[2153.52 - 2158.20] me put out there nobody talked about
[2154.92 - 2159.88] Metals all these years
[2158.20 - 2161.60] medical medum information put it out
[2159.88 - 2163.20] there the original heavy metal detox the
[2161.60 - 2164.64] one that actually works I love how
[2163.20 - 2165.96] people have done all kinds of spin-offs
[2164.64 - 2168.04] I'm going to put this in here I'm going
[2165.96 - 2171.08] to put great it's not going to work
[2168.04 - 2174.96] anymore great you did a disservice to
[2171.08 - 2176.84] people the heavy metal detox right there
[2174.96 - 2178.68] that gets the metals out the heavy metal
[2176.84 - 2181.60] detox is really critical for getting
[2178.68 - 2183.80] Metals out of Bones and bone marrow and
[2181.60 - 2186.52] that improves the immune cells
[2183.80 - 2188.24] interesting boots McGee what's going on
[2186.52 - 2190.48] there on YouTube since taking total
[2188.24 - 2192.48] immune I haven't gotten sick and have
[2190.48 - 2195.12] been traveling more than I have in my
[2192.48 - 2198.12] entire life and guess what boots McGee
[2195.12 - 2199.92] someone just recently told me that that
[2198.12 - 2202.56] since they were taking total
[2199.92 - 2205.08] immune same thing you guys know I work
[2202.56 - 2209.36] with fmer vimer is the best stuff there
[2205.08 - 2212.64] is hands down and I don't want it to go
[2209.36 - 2214.20] away I don't want it to just go away
[2212.64 - 2216.00] because you don't know what you got
[2214.20 - 2218.92] until it's gone and people are going to
[2216.00 - 2220.56] be sorry if it ever goes away
[2218.92 - 2222.20] people are going to be sorry the people
[2220.56 - 2223.40] that know are going to be sorry people
[2222.20 - 2226.00] who don't know they're just going to
[2223.40 - 2229.48] whatever and be sick and that's it you
[2226.00 - 2231.64] know and so um and I use I use this for
[2229.48 - 2235.04] my friends and family my family and I
[2231.64 - 2237.04] use vimer G like we take it every single
[2235.04 - 2240.44] day I'm telling you right now that's
[2237.04 - 2241.64] what we do um there's something I was
[2240.44 - 2243.04] going to tell you guys too a bunch of

[2639.56 - 2645.32] over there [ __ ] Cherry saver said
[2641.68 - 2648.32] followed you for ages and just now it
[2645.32 - 2650.88] clicked thank
[2648.32 - 2653.76] you I have a lot to say about that by
[2650.88 - 2656.88] the way I'm not going to say it I I'm
[2653.76 - 2658.64] choosing not to say it right now I got a
[2656.88 - 2661.60] lot to say about
[2658.64 - 2664.24] that exactly you've been following me on
[2661.60 - 2668.32] IG but for some right reason can't see
[2664.24 - 2670.32] my Ig and yeah so are a lot of people
[2668.32 - 2673.72] right because it's strange how it works
[2670.32 - 2676.76] algorithms are so weird all right let's
[2673.72 - 2678.16] go so we got the shingles virus and
[2676.76 - 2682.72] inside the shingles virus you got a
[2678.16 - 2685.00] little bit of a nucleus okay
[2682.72 - 2692.12] right shingles
[2685.00 - 2696.64] virus has a really really toxic outer
[2692.12 - 2698.36] membran really highly toxic okay and
[2696.64 - 2701.16] with the shingles virus does is it
[2698.36 - 2704.08] releases a dermatoxin out of this
[2701.16 - 2707.24] membrane okay but that dermatoxin
[2704.08 - 2709.88] Shields the virus the reason why people
[2707.24 - 2712.52] suffer from the shingle so much is it's
[2709.88 - 2715.12] a hard bug to kill but you got to be
[2712.52 - 2718.40] smart about it got to be really smart
[2715.12 - 2721.24] about it you got to know information you
[2718.40 - 2724.16] have to know information see this book
[2721.24 - 2728.32] right here see now you see it now you
[2724.16 - 2730.24] don't see the book the shingle virus
[2728.32 - 2734.40] very very
[2730.24 - 2738.20] toxic outer layer and inside layer of a
[2734.40 - 2740.16] membrane right the nucleus produces a
[2738.20 - 2742.52] tremendous amount of
[2740.16 - 2745.28] dermatoxin it's a
[2742.52 - 2748.60] factory the amount of dermatoxin that
[2745.28 - 2750.84] spews out of shingles and then leeches
[2748.60 - 2753.28] everywhere on the
[2750.84 - 2755.32] body is is
[2753.28 - 2759.04] terrifying that
[2755.32 - 2760.20] nucleus releases is all that dermatoxin
[2759.04 - 2764.56] and here it
[2760.20 - 2767.64] goes okay boom here's the
[2764.56 - 2769.96] dermatoxin here it is watch
[2767.64 - 2771.44] this watch this see the dermatoxin
[2769.96 - 2773.88] coming out of the shingles virus you
[2771.44 - 2777.44] guys and this is why people suffer let
[2773.88 - 2780.44] me show you this get this get
[2777.44 - 2780.44] ready
[2781.48 - 2787.44] okay and here's your nerves you
[2785.40 - 2788.76] ready there's your nerv nerves your
[2787.44 - 2792.48] vagus
[2788.76 - 2793.96] nerves your tibial nerves your frenic
[2792.48 - 2797.76] nerves you guys want to pick a nerve for
[2793.96 - 2799.68] me your sciatic nerve here they are
[2797.76 - 2805.48] here's your
[2799.68 - 2809.12] nerves tibial sciatic frenic
[2805.48 - 2812.84] Vegas okay get
[2809.12 - 2817.04] ready all of that dermatoxin saturates
[2812.84 - 2820.48] the nerves you see this so poisonous
[2817.04 - 2820.48] that your nerves get
[2820.96 - 2826.44] inflamed right there that's the shingles
[2823.36 - 2828.64] virus the nucleus producing dermatoxin
[2826.44 - 2830.84] the dermatoxin leaving the membrane
[2828.64 - 2833.64] going into the membrane the membrane
[2830.84 - 2836.32] becoming hot and toxic then spewing out
[2833.64 - 2840.44] the dermatoxin and then it hitting all
[2836.32 - 2842.92] your nerves your sciatic nerve yep your
[2840.44 - 2846.40] tibial nerve
[2842.92 - 2847.44] yep all the different nerves okay your
[2846.40 - 2850.52] trien
[2847.44 - 2854.40] nerve all of them so many different
[2850.52 - 2856.76] nerves your veg nerves your frenic
[2854.40 - 2859.84] nerves and what happens is those nerves
[2856.76 - 2864.40] get lit here's the problem that
[2859.84 - 2868.08] dermatoxin it stays on those
[2864.40 - 2870.48] nerves and then you just suffer in pain
[2868.08 - 2874.08] what we have to do is we have to kill
[2870.48 - 2877.44] the virus we have to kill the virus we
[2874.08 - 2879.64] have to strengthen our immune system
[2877.44 - 2882.00] and we need the maintenance to do that
[2879.64 - 2883.32] kind of stuff we need it to do that kind
[2882.00 - 2886.28] of stuff
[2883.32 - 2890.36] strengthen the immune cells so we can
[2886.28 - 2895.04] kill this virus and then over time the
[2890.36 - 2898.68] dermatoxin waxes and wains and it drops
[2895.04 - 2901.00] back and drops back and drops back and
[2898.68 - 2902.52] then you come out now you're rehabbing
[2901.00 - 2904.64] you're rehabbing and you're like oh my
[2902.52 - 2908.76] God I'm getting past the shingles attack
[2904.64 - 2908.76] and I'm rehabbing and that's what happen
[2909.80 - 2914.36] happens okay I think I think you were
[2912.76 - 2915.00] saying I saw another comment that you're
[2914.36 - 2917.40] were
[2915.00 - 2919.00] saying it finally clicked in the
[2917.40 - 2921.08] information you've been following me for
[2919.00 - 2926.12] years or you clicked it and could see me
[2921.08 - 2926.12] that's what it was either one but yep
[2927.00 - 2931.04] okay you guys pretty
[2931.20 - 2936.52] amazing anyway check out the vimergy
[2934.08 - 2939.56] stuff for maintenance like the propolis
[2936.52 - 2942.32] for cats claw in the total
[2939.56 - 2944.96] immune and make sure you're like staying
[2942.32 - 2947.00] away from foods that will feed your
[2944.96 - 2949.04] pathogens that's a big one all on its
[2947.00 - 2950.68] own it's a big one all on its own Max
[2949.04 - 2953.52] vond over there on YouTube why does
[2950.68 - 2956.16] shingles itching come to me just as I'm
[2953.52 - 2958.92] starting to meditate or when I'm almost
[2956.16 - 2960.04] falling asleep it's like it knows when
[2958.92 - 2962.32] to hit me first of all when you're
[2960.04 - 2963.64] almost falling asleep right you're not
[2962.32 - 2964.84] you're not like doing things and
[2963.64 - 2966.76] everything you're you're almost falling
[2964.84 - 2969.92] asleep you're going to feel things more
[2966.76 - 2972.72] or right when you can feel a pee under
[2969.92 - 2974.40] the mattress you can feel a marble under
[2972.72 - 2976.56] the mattress right before falling asleep
[2974.40 - 2979.04] a lot of people you can hear the wind
[2976.56 - 2981.60] blow outside when you're falling asleep
[2979.04 - 2984.20] you can hear the floorboards Creak when
[2981.60 - 2986.08] you're falling asleep right you know you
[2984.20 - 2987.60] can hear your heartbeat how many people
[2986.08 - 2989.76] hear their heartbeat before they fall
[2987.60 - 2991.76] asleep they feel their pulse before they
[2989.76 - 2993.16] fall asleep right you can hear it in
[2991.76 - 2995.16] your ear a lot of people hear it in
[2993.16 - 2996.72] their ear as they're falling asleep and
[2995.16 - 2998.60] you're going to feel the itching come up
[2996.72 - 3001.36] on when you're falling asleep too that's
[2998.60 - 3003.36] one thing but yes at the same time our
[3001.36 - 3005.60] weakest point of time our immune system
[3003.36 - 3007.48] is is at the end of the day our immune
[3005.60 - 3009.28] system is at its weakest at the end of
[3007.48 - 3010.52] the day it's why when I'm always telling
[3009.28 - 3011.84] people to do the maintenance like
[3010.52 - 3014.56] friends and family and everything with
[3011.84 - 3016.12] the propolis and the cat's claw I'm like
[3014.56 - 3018.08] make sure you take some at the end of
[3016.12 - 3020.56] the day too make sure you take some at
[3018.08 - 3022.56] night before you go to bed because
[3020.56 - 3024.52] that's important because the weakest
[3022.56 - 3026.16] point in time where our immune cells are
[3024.52 - 3028.72] at their weakest is at the end of the
[3026.16 - 3030.80] day at at night and they're stronger in
[3028.72 - 3033.12] the morning after a little bit of rest
[3030.80 - 3034.52] even two hours of sleep 1 hour of sleep
[3033.12 - 3037.48] half an hour of sleep they get a Little
[3034.52 - 3039.08] Bit Stronger but at night at the end of
[3037.48 - 3041.20] the day they're at their weakest and
[3039.08 - 3043.28] yeah your viral flares could be edging
[3041.20 - 3045.04] up that could be making you itchy itchy
[3043.28 - 3046.84] too people itchy and all irritated and
[3045.04 - 3049.04] stuff and everything else but at the end
[3046.84 - 3051.64] of the day your immune system is at its
[3049.04 - 3053.68] weakest it's weaker keep in mind about
[3051.64 - 3055.60] that and so I tell like friends and
[3053.68 - 3057.40] family and I tell doctor friends make
[3055.60 - 3059.44] sure you're doing
[3057.40 - 3061.04] you right you know your maintenance also
[3059.44 - 3063.40] at the end of the day make sure you're
[3061.04 - 3066.08] getting you know boom support for your
[3063.40 - 3067.72] immune system at the end of the day
[3066.08 - 3069.36] anyway you guys check out medical medum
[3067.72 - 3071.24] podcast at Apple podcast check out my
[3069.36 - 3074.76] telegram I'm going to start leaving um
[3071.24 - 3076.40] new audio messages on my telegram so
[3074.76 - 3078.52] that that time is coming so get ready
[3076.40 - 3080.88] for that check out my old audio messages
[3078.52 - 3082.24] on telegram like Pride and Prejudice how
[3080.88 - 3083.80] I what I talked about with Pride and
[3082.24 - 3085.12] Prejudice and all that information which
[3083.80 - 3087.88] I'm going to talk about
[3085.12 - 3090.48] again and I just saw um a comment there
[3087.88 - 3091.96] okay oh wow that explained a lot I get
[3090.48 - 3095.36] symptoms at the end of the day cold
[3091.96 - 3100.48] white spring cold white spring
[3095.36 - 3104.28] amazing and um yeah you guys all good
[3100.48 - 3106.08] stuff all good stuff I saw a comment
[3104.28 - 3107.52] talking about um lymphatic drainage I'm
[3106.08 - 3109.64] not against lymphatic massage or
[3107.52 - 3110.88] drainage I think it helps people I do
[3109.64 - 3113.36] I'm not against it at all I'm not
[3110.88 - 3115.68] against massage massage I think is
[3113.36 - 3117.76] incredible for people I'm not against
[3115.68 - 3119.92] lymphatic drainage I think that's great
[3117.76 - 3123.68] all of that but I'm just saying I I only
[3119.92 - 3125.72] talk about how if we don't address
[3123.68 - 3128.52] what's behind our lymphatic system the
[3125.72 - 3130.52] root cause and then you know that's
[3128.52 - 3132.24] that's a whole another thing so that's
[3130.52 - 3133.80] it it's about cleaning up the liver
[3132.24 - 3135.80] cleaning up the lymphatic system
[3133.80 - 3137.28] internally strengthening the lymphatic
[3135.80 - 3139.36] system's immune system let's hit that
[3137.28 - 3141.04] one one per a minute this is important
[3139.36 - 3143.88] right here
[3141.04 - 3147.04] okay this next thing I'm going to talk
[3143.88 - 3149.32] about is very very important
[3147.04 - 3152.36] it's immune system
[3149.32 - 3156.64] related lymphatic
[3152.36 - 3159.68] system can get toxic and clogged up yes
[3156.64 - 3161.28] but your lymphocytes are critical to
[3159.68 - 3163.96] understand but if you're really really
[3161.28 - 3167.04] sick and you and and if you're really
[3163.96 - 3168.88] sick and in a weakened State you got to
[3167.04 - 3171.20] be careful you know and you're and
[3168.88 - 3173.16] you're swelling there's information you
[3171.20 - 3176.72] can learn about that too on on medical
[3173.16 - 3179.96] meem podcast check out my
[3176.72 - 3182.76] my swelling episode right there all
[3179.96 - 3185.32] right let's get this going
[3182.76 - 3188.72] here all right let's make a little bit
[3185.32 - 3188.72] of a lymphatic system
[3193.68 - 3198.24] here little bit of a lymphatic system
[3196.00 - 3198.24] you
[3198.72 - 3203.88] guys
[3200.68 - 3203.88] okay all
[3205.12 - 3209.04] right got a lymphatic
[3210.12 - 3213.12] system
[3221.20 - 3229.24] okay an incredible artist at
[3225.16 - 3231.00] hand there's an artist in in person here
[3229.24 - 3232.56] um so I want to talk about this right
[3231.00 - 3233.80] here so as you got fluid in your
[3232.56 - 3237.16] lymphatic
[3233.80 - 3238.12] system keep in mind that
[3237.16 - 3241.56] you got
[3238.12 - 3244.72] lymphocytes here
[3241.56 - 3248.20] lymphocytes they need to be fed your
[3244.72 - 3251.00] lymphocytes that are in your lymphatic
[3248.20 - 3253.68] system those lymphocytes
[3251.00 - 3257.32] devour pathogens in your lymphatic
[3253.68 - 3260.56] system keep that in mind right there if
[3257.32 - 3263.28] you don't address the
[3260.56 - 3266.80] liver and your lymphatic system is
[3263.28 - 3270.16] constantly dirty and clogged you're
[3266.80 - 3273.04] keeping your immune system weakened okay
[3270.16 - 3276.72] so yes I'm not against lymphatic
[3273.04 - 3279.56] drainage but what needs to be done is
[3276.72 - 3281.80] the core root cause of your lymphatic
[3279.56 - 3285.04] problems which is your liver being
[3281.80 - 3288.04] stagnant sluggish filled the toxins and
[3285.04 - 3290.00] poisons that's one thing and the other
[3288.04 - 3291.40] aspect of the immune system which is
[3290.00 - 3295.04] your
[3291.40 - 3297.72] lymphocytes no one's talking about
[3295.04 - 3299.32] lymphocytes they're talking about that
[3297.72 - 3302.28] part of your immune system which is
[3299.32 - 3303.64] critical right you still have to do
[3302.28 - 3306.00] maintenance and you still have to feed
[3303.64 - 3307.08] your lymphocytes if you don't feed them
[3306.00 - 3309.80] and they're
[3307.08 - 3311.88] weak they can't work for you and they
[3309.80 - 3313.36] can't catch pathogens and they can't
[3311.88 - 3315.48] catch
[3313.36 - 3318.44] poisons and if you're playing with your
[3315.48 - 3321.44] lymphatic system too much and you're and
[3318.44 - 3324.52] it's being manipulated and purged and
[3321.44 - 3327.60] squeezed your lymphocytes are having a
[3324.52 - 3329.80] hard time trying to to find balance in
[3327.60 - 3332.24] that they're being pushed
[3329.80 - 3334.40] around and they need their natural
[3332.24 - 3336.72] habitat to be slightly undisturbed in
[3334.40 - 3340.28] certain areas so when people go through
[3336.72 - 3343.32] the roof crazy with lymphatic
[3340.28 - 3345.80] drainage they're they're manipulating
[3343.32 - 3348.16] the habitat of the of the
[3345.80 - 3349.96] lymphocyte and that can weaken the
[3348.16 - 3353.76] lymphatic immune
[3349.96 - 3357.64] system so it there's a there's a there's
[3353.76 - 3359.92] a place where we can get massage and
[3357.64 - 3363.84] drainage lymphatic drainage gentle
[3359.92 - 3366.64] gentle drainage but there's also a fine
[3363.84 - 3370.08] line between if we do
[3366.64 - 3371.32] extremism with the lymphatic system and
[3370.08 - 3375.72] we
[3371.32 - 3375.72] weaken the lymphatic systems
[3380.28 - 3384.96] lymphocytic system all the time and
[3382.72 - 3387.60] we're trying to push fluid and push
[3384.96 - 3390.36] fluid and push fluid so we can a look
[3387.60 - 3394.40] better or feel better in a bikini or
[3390.36 - 3398.12] whatever it is if we're
[3394.40 - 3400.40] literally water boarding and literally
[3398.12 - 3402.28] crushing down on our lymphatic vessels
[3400.40 - 3405.64] and trying to squeeze every last bit of
[3402.28 - 3408.72] fluid out of them we just manipulated
[3405.64 - 3411.64] our lymphocytes and our immune cells
[3408.72 - 3413.44] which weakens our immune system so we
[3411.64 - 3418.00] have to be careful with how much
[3413.44 - 3420.80] manipulation we do on on our lympo on on
[3418.00 - 3421.60] our lymphatic system so we can protect
[3420.80 - 3424.56] our
[3421.60 - 3425.88] lymphocytes what I'm trying to say is
[3424.56 - 3430.16] your lymphatic
[3425.88 - 3432.44] system your lymph your lymph system has
[3430.16 - 3435.52] the lymphocytes big part of your immune
[3432.44 - 3438.32] system but if we're beating the crap out
[3435.52 - 3441.12] of our lymphatic system just so we can
[3438.32 - 3443.40] push fluid around we are manipulating
[3441.12 - 3445.16] and pushing lymphocytes around and they
[3443.40 - 3447.92] take the hit and they get
[3445.16 - 3451.64] damaged so every time we get a lymphatic
[3447.92 - 3455.52] draining session like a really deep
[3451.64 - 3456.88] one our lymphocytes need time to recover
[3455.52 - 3459.92] and
[3456.88 - 3462.52] replenish and maybe even need time to
[3459.92 - 3464.72] restore because we can hinder our
[3462.52 - 3466.12] lymphocytes but I do still like
[3464.72 - 3469.08] lymphatic drainage especially if you're
[3466.12 - 3470.68] sary and you can't you can't move around
[3469.08 - 3472.80] I want people to still get it if they
[3470.68 - 3476.36] can I still want them to get
[3472.80 - 3480.44] it but the fluid is there to protect the
[3476.36 - 3482.84] lymphocyte too keep that in mind so if
[3480.44 - 3486.08] you're really toxic and you're trying to
[3482.84 - 3487.40] move toxins through your lymphatic fluid
[3486.08 - 3489.76] keep in mind that when we're moving
[3487.40 - 3493.48] those toxins around we're pushing our
[3489.76 - 3494.48] lymphocytes into those toxins manually
[3493.48 - 3496.92] we're
[3494.48 - 3498.60] manipulating our lymphatic systems
[3496.92 - 3500.40] immune system so we have to be careful
[3498.60 - 3501.52] to some degree so what I tell people a
[3500.40 - 3503.16] lot of people ask me like what do you
[3501.52 - 3507.12] think about lymphatic massage I say it's
[3503.16 - 3509.56] great just don't go extremism
[3507.12 - 3511.72] where you're doing it every day you're
[3509.56 - 3515.20] not giving your lymphocytes a chance to
[3511.72 - 3517.32] recovery build reestablish themselves
[3515.20 - 3519.64] and don't go so crazy where you have
[3517.32 - 3521.64] machines on you and you're trying to use
[3519.64 - 3523.08] the machines the vibrating machines
[3521.64 - 3525.76] where you're trying to literally get
[3523.08 - 3527.60] every little scrap of juice out of some
[3525.76 - 3530.64] of your lymphatic
[3527.60 - 3533.36] system we retain fluid in our lymphatic
[3530.64 - 3535.08] system to dilute the toxins so here
[3533.36 - 3536.76] people are actually trying to push our
[3535.08 - 3539.36] fluid out
[3536.76 - 3541.00] but toxins still stay behind and sludge
[3539.36 - 3542.96] still stays behind and what they're
[3541.00 - 3545.32] doing is they're trying to manually push
[3542.96 - 3548.40] out all the fluid but toxins are still
[3545.32 - 3550.92] staying behind so keep in mind that we
[3548.40 - 3552.56] do want some fluid left in our lymphatic
[3550.92 - 3554.60] system because I see people using a lot
[3552.56 - 3557.40] of tools and a lot of lymphatic
[3554.60 - 3560.36] machinery and I'm like oh dear Lord
[3557.40 - 3562.12] You're squeezing fluid out but a lot of
[3560.36 - 3564.32] sludge and toxins are staying behind
[3562.12 - 3565.84] without fluid anymore in there to
[3564.32 - 3567.28] actually protect you and your immune
[3565.84 - 3569.04] system system and you're also
[3567.28 - 3572.48] manipulating and pushing
[3569.04 - 3574.72] lymphatic lymphocyte cells out when you
[3572.48 - 3577.32] need them in there to protect you from
[3574.72 - 3580.72] pathogens and so forth the lymphocytes
[3577.32 - 3583.32] die quickly if it's too toxic in there
[3580.72 - 3586.16] but they die quickly if we're also
[3583.32 - 3588.36] manipulating them and grinding them into
[3586.16 - 3590.28] nothing because we're using so much
[3588.36 - 3592.40] manipulation with the lymphatic drainage
[3590.28 - 3594.36] Styles and techniques now it's not just
[3592.40 - 3596.80] what it used to be people are getting
[3594.36 - 3598.20] like obsessed and they're using machines
[3596.80 - 3599.96] and rollers and they're trying to
[3598.20 - 3601.60] squeeze every last bit of juice out of
[3599.96 - 3603.60] people I'm sure that's not probably what
[3601.60 - 3605.64] you're doing you might just be getting a
[3603.60 - 3607.20] normal lymphatic drainage session I
[3605.64 - 3609.24] think that's great I think it's
[3607.20 - 3612.28] supportive but we also have to work on
[3609.24 - 3614.60] the liver and we have to protect we have
[3612.28 - 3616.44] to at least feed our lymphocytes that's
[3614.60 - 3618.12] why I talk about the maintenance stuff
[3616.44 - 3620.80] with the propolis pure and the cats claw
[3618.12 - 3623.00] and and the total immune to feed our
[3620.80 - 3625.28] lymphocytes as well over there in IG
[3623.00 - 3627.56] ingred says what's the brand for the
[3625.28 - 3630.28] propolis and the cats clots vimergy V is
[3627.56 - 3633.48] in Victor i m is in Mary E RG
[3630.28 - 3634.96] y.com link is in the description I think
[3633.48 - 3638.20] and all that so you
[3634.96 - 3641.00] guys Incredible One Day at a Time keep
[3638.20 - 3644.08] up all your healing but this is another
[3641.00 - 3646.00] you know another show about the immune
[3644.08 - 3647.68] system learning all these different
[3646.00 - 3649.48] things about the immune system very
[3647.68 - 3651.64] important because we can forget take it
[3649.48 - 3655.04] for granted not realize what's going on
[3651.64 - 3657.40] we lose we lose our Direction and then
[3655.04 - 3659.00] we're sick and we stay sick for years
[3657.40 - 3660.80] and we're confused and we're just
[3659.00 - 3663.20] watching social and the internet and
[3660.80 - 3665.20] we're seeing every new you know new
[3663.20 - 3666.88] flashy thing that comes up and we're
[3665.20 - 3668.56] grabbing this and doing this meanwhile
[3666.88 - 3670.24] our immune system is struggling it needs
[3668.56 - 3672.12] support we need to learn about our
[3670.24 - 3674.28] immune system all that's critical all
[3672.12 - 3678.72] right you guys guys know I love
[3674.28 - 3682.12] you incredible to be here again and um
[3678.72 - 3682.12] I'll see you guys soon
