[689.60 - 693.28] have terrible brain fog
[690.88 - 694.72] oh my god that's awful it's such a
[693.28 - 697.92] struggle through
[694.72 - 700.08] uni i have hypothyroidism and i think
[697.92 - 701.20] it's getting worse i would do anything
[700.08 - 703.68] to get help
[701.20 - 704.80] as the gluten-free diet didn't help i've
[703.68 - 706.48] talked about that
[704.80 - 707.92] i actually talked about it in the brain
[706.48 - 709.52] fog episode too
[707.92 - 711.76] about how there's all these guessing
[709.52 - 713.60] games going on you're on a plant-based
[711.76 - 715.60] diet for 12 years i still believe
[713.60 - 716.72] it's my thyroid first of all i support
[715.60 - 719.04] plant-based diets
[716.72 - 720.88] i support also animal-based diets but i
[719.04 - 722.40] support plant-based diets but what i've
[720.88 - 724.32] always told everybody is
[722.40 - 726.32] in order to heal because people on
[724.32 - 727.68] plant-based diets and animal-based diets
[726.32 - 729.92] both get sick
[727.68 - 731.44] and in order to heal we need to know
[729.92 - 734.32] what's causing it
[731.44 - 736.08] what's causing the brain fog what is it
[734.32 - 738.64] and in the episode you'll hear me go
[736.08 - 740.56] oh look over there look over there
[738.64 - 742.32] there's a new guessing game over there
[740.56 - 744.08] there's a new guessing game over there
[742.32 - 745.12] you'll hear it in the episode and what i
[744.08 - 746.80] was saying was
[745.12 - 748.24] there's a lot of guessing games but
[746.80 - 749.04] unless you know what's causing your
[748.24 - 750.88] brain fog
[749.04 - 752.64] we're just guessing and that's what
[750.88 - 754.16] we're doing in fact i said something
[752.64 - 757.60] else more than that
[754.16 - 758.16] about it um pearl said listen to your
[757.60 - 760.32] podcast
[758.16 - 761.44] on brain fog today and you describe this
[760.32 - 762.88] condition so
[761.44 - 764.72] well pearl are you gonna listen to all
[762.88 - 765.76] my episodes so you can spread the
[764.72 - 768.48] information out there

[772.32 - 777.60] and i'm in and my job is to actually
[775.76 - 779.84] know what's going on with people and
[777.60 - 781.28] their symptoms i was known since i was
[779.84 - 783.44] age four years old
[781.28 - 784.56] as the person that people with bizarre
[783.44 - 787.52] symptoms came to
[784.56 - 788.80] because i understood them because of the
[787.52 - 789.84] because of the gift with spirit of
[788.80 - 791.12] compassion so
[789.84 - 792.32] that's what i've always been known my
[791.12 - 792.96] whole life that's why millions have
[792.32 - 794.96] healed with

[830.40 - 834.00] have you tried the moon meditation
[832.32 - 835.76] the free is a bird meditation the
[834.00 - 837.28] freezer bird meditation would be a great
[835.76 - 839.68] one to try for that
[837.28 - 840.72] um kate says yes brain fog is just
[839.68 - 843.84] terrible

[881.68 - 885.28] working so hard on your healing process
[883.36 - 887.92] so with brain fog
[885.28 - 889.84] what happens is you can be like fogged
[887.92 - 890.96] out all morning you can be fogged out in
[889.84 - 893.28] and out of the day
[890.96 - 894.96] you can be fogged out at night or what
[893.28 - 898.08] usually happens with brain fog
[894.96 - 901.20] you're fogged all day long all
[898.08 - 902.00] day long and then at the end of the day
[901.20 - 903.92] at night
[902.00 - 905.36] you're like coming back to life and
[903.92 - 906.80] you're just springing back to life for a
[905.36 - 908.32] little bit and you get clarity and you
[906.80 - 910.48] get clarity and then you're up
[908.32 - 912.88] later at night with that clarity and
[910.48 - 914.64] then you go to bed and you wake up the
[912.88 - 916.32] next morning and you're fogged out again
[914.64 - 917.76] that's one version right there
[916.32 - 920.24] another version is like when you're
[917.76 - 921.68] talking to other people you kind of like
[920.24 - 922.96] with the words that are coming
[921.68 - 924.96] the words that are in your head don't
[922.96 - 926.00] come out the right way they come out
[924.96 - 929.20] kind of wrong
[926.00 - 931.20] or they come out disjointed disc but
[929.20 - 933.36] combolated they just come out all kind
[931.20 - 934.88] of strange and it happens to so many
[933.36 - 936.08] people and i've seen people struggle
[934.88 - 937.92] like that or
[936.08 - 939.12] it's hard to listen to what the person's
[937.92 - 940.08] telling you because you're thinking
[939.12 - 941.84] about what you're thinking
[940.08 - 944.00] and then you're kind of not listening to
[941.84 - 946.40] what they're saying but you miss it and
[944.00 - 948.24] that happens to so many people the brain
[946.40 - 950.48] fog is even hard on people they get
[948.24 - 951.68] drained by being around other people so
[950.48 - 953.36] if you're around maybe
[951.68 - 954.80] people that you're not really that
[953.36 - 955.28] comfortable with or people that you're
[954.80 - 956.80] just
[955.28 - 958.32] you're not in the mood to be around with
[956.80 - 959.84] family and friends or something and all
[958.32 - 961.28] of a sudden the brain fog worsens and
[959.84 - 962.40] you feel drained
[961.28 - 964.40] you know there's so many different
[962.40 - 965.44] versions of brain fog and it makes it so
[964.40 - 968.08] difficult
[965.44 - 969.36] uh kenzie says wow didn't realize my

[1221.76 - 1226.00] depressed and brain fog too you know it
[1224.64 - 1227.68] just breaks my heart that you guys are
[1226.00 - 1230.64] all dealing with brain fog
[1227.68 - 1231.28] um ayanna is social anxiety linked to
[1230.64 - 1232.96] brain fog
[1231.28 - 1234.72] it's there's definitely a link because
[1232.96 - 1236.16] it happens is the anxiety and brain fog
[1234.72 - 1237.76] that come together and then social
[1236.16 - 1240.00] anxiety and brain fog
[1237.76 - 1241.44] that's a whole thing too absolutely i'm
[1240.00 - 1242.08] answering questions you guys up here if
[1241.44 - 1245.68] you want to
[1242.08 - 1249.04] ask some questions and
[1245.68 - 1251.44] really the brain fog episode opens the
[1249.04 - 1253.36] door to understand it like no other so
[1251.44 - 1254.32] you know what's going on with everything
[1253.36 - 1256.24] and all of it
[1254.32 - 1257.84] loon says brain fog to me feels like i
[1256.24 - 1260.72] am being dumbed down
[1257.84 - 1262.80] as if i was under heavy drug abuse not
[1260.72 - 1264.32] fun and also it's hard to do anything i
[1262.80 - 1266.40] get very clumsy and confused
[1264.32 - 1267.76] so loon you dealt with the brain fog you
[1266.40 - 1270.72] struggled with it
[1267.76 - 1271.76] and and that's just it's really hard
[1270.72 - 1273.76] hard hard you know
[1271.76 - 1274.80] and that's the thing if someone hasn't
[1273.76 - 1276.40] had brain fog
[1274.80 - 1278.16] and they never struggled with it on any
[1276.40 - 1279.84] level and a lot of you guys might not
[1278.16 - 1282.00] even know you have brain fog until you

[1394.56 - 1398.40] and so you guys you know one thing about
[1396.96 - 1400.72] brain fog is interesting
[1398.40 - 1402.80] is that it's not even considered
[1400.72 - 1404.48] anything like
[1402.80 - 1405.92] medical research and science the
[1404.48 - 1406.48] industries don't even think it's
[1405.92 - 1408.56] anything
[1406.48 - 1409.76] and even alternative medicine has a hard
[1408.56 - 1412.24] time with it because when you
[1409.76 - 1414.80] you when they when altered medicine they
[1412.24 - 1416.40] kind of see it as brain fog are you just
[1414.80 - 1418.00] are you really dealing with brain fog or
[1416.40 - 1420.00] is it something else it's
[1418.00 - 1421.76] we're always underestimated we're always
[1420.00 - 1423.36] misunderstood with brain fog
[1421.76 - 1425.52] and then we don't even know to call it
[1423.36 - 1426.24] brain fog we're just like i don't feel
[1425.52 - 1428.56] well or
[1426.24 - 1429.60] maybe this is who i am where i'm bumping
[1428.56 - 1431.20] into walls and
[1429.60 - 1433.76] not even bumping the walls i can't get
[1431.20 - 1435.28] anything done i know you guys want to be
[1433.76 - 1437.84] like have the clarity
[1435.28 - 1439.52] be on your game your intuition being
[1437.84 - 1441.92] solid and strong
