[1021.28 - 1025.60] okay if you want to get better first of
[1023.84 - 1028.32] all you have to know why you're sick
[1025.60 - 1030.32] like really why you're sick not because
[1028.32 - 1030.88] someone told you your head was chopped
[1030.32 - 1034.88] off
[1030.88 - 1035.76] in 1734 in england in one of your past
[1034.88 - 1037.28] lives

[1037.28 - 1040.80] you're sick right now okay let's go
[1039.12 - 1043.68] let's do another one
[1040.80 - 1044.64] it's important to know why you're sick
[1043.68 - 1046.64] instead
[1044.64 - 1048.40] m sky good to see you good to see you
[1046.64 - 1050.00] i'm sky you're you're

[1050.00 - 1053.44] always i think sometimes you said in
[1051.28 - 1056.56] comments like i missed them live
[1053.44 - 1059.04] em sky um or
[1056.56 - 1060.40] you know sometimes people are told they
[1059.04 - 1062.80] just manifested it
[1060.40 - 1064.16] okay it's it they created it did you
[1062.80 - 1067.20] guys create your sickness
[1064.16 - 1068.56] i wanna know did you guys create it
[1067.20 - 1070.96] on clubhouse did you guys create your
[1068.56 - 1072.64] sickness did you manifest it
[1070.96 - 1074.24] did you did you think some bad thoughts
[1072.64 - 1075.28] and that's how you got sick are you a
[1074.24 - 1077.84] bad person
[1075.28 - 1079.20] are you faulty because that's another
[1077.84 - 1082.40] thing all on its own
[1079.20 - 1085.52] people are told that they're they're
[1082.40 - 1086.96] they have a fear of healing right
[1085.52 - 1088.64] do you guys have a fear of healing i
[1086.96 - 1090.72] want to know
[1088.64 - 1092.56] um because that's what people are told
[1090.72 - 1093.48] they said well you got a fear of healing
[1092.56 - 1096.48] or you
[1093.48 - 1099.52] attracted your sickness
[1096.48 - 1104.16] you attracted your sickness right
[1099.52 - 1107.52] and um still mashing it
[1104.16 - 1109.12] you attracted your sickness you created
[1107.52 - 1111.52] it karma is karma
[1109.12 - 1112.64] is karma got you this car is that why
[1111.52 - 1114.88] you're sick
[1112.64 - 1115.84] you guys i want to know who believes
[1114.88 - 1118.08] it's karma
[1115.84 - 1119.28] must be karma right paying your dues is
[1118.08 - 1121.28] that what it is
[1119.28 - 1123.28] well is that is that how it worked do
[1121.28 - 1124.40] you think a two-year-old manifested it i
[1123.28 - 1126.48] want to know
[1124.40 - 1128.40] see an incredible i noticed that the
[1126.48 - 1130.48] spiritual healing movement which
[1128.40 - 1132.64] back before medical medium really got
[1130.48 - 1134.72] out there i mean it's been 35 years now
[1132.64 - 1137.04] with medical medium right but
[1134.72 - 1138.80] right at the start though you know it
[1137.04 - 1140.16] wasn't the millions
[1138.80 - 1142.00] right now that are learning about
[1140.16 - 1143.84] medical medium info right
[1142.00 - 1145.84] um it was obviously a smaller crowd back
[1143.84 - 1149.36] 35 years ago right of course
[1145.84 - 1150.72] and but what happened is that back then
[1149.36 - 1152.80] everybody was still doing the spiritual
[1150.72 - 1153.44] stuff that same thing but people were
[1152.80 - 1154.72] still sick
[1153.44 - 1156.48] and they were just like well i guess i
[1154.72 - 1157.44] attracted i guess it was my karma or
[1156.48 - 1159.84] something like
[1157.44 - 1160.72] but you know it all falls apart when you
[1159.84 - 1162.80] think about
[1160.72 - 1165.04] did did the two-year-old manifest it
[1162.80 - 1167.68] because i'm kind of curious
[1165.04 - 1169.12] you know like what happened there what
[1167.68 - 1172.08] about the five-year-old did the
[1169.12 - 1175.20] five-year-old have some bad karma
[1172.08 - 1176.48] no right no there's reasons why we're
[1175.20 - 1178.40] sick
[1176.48 - 1180.24] and and the thing is with the trendy
[1178.40 - 1182.00] traps out there you guys and the trendy
[1180.24 - 1185.04] products and the trendy traps
[1182.00 - 1186.40] right okay out there the people putting
[1185.04 - 1188.00] that stuff out there they don't know why
[1186.40 - 1190.16] anybody's sick
[1188.00 - 1191.84] they don't know why it all comes down to
[1190.16 - 1194.64] the same old kind of like theories well
[1191.84 - 1197.04] was it gut issues was it candida
[1194.64 - 1198.00] was it what is it like you know why are
[1197.04 - 1200.16] people sick
[1198.00 - 1201.28] do they manifest it i'm not saying to
[1200.16 - 1203.68] not think positive
[1201.28 - 1204.32] absolutely think positive i want you
[1203.68 - 1206.40] guys to have
[1204.32 - 1207.60] your dreams your aspirations your
[1206.40 - 1209.52] affirmations

[1211.04 - 1213.76] i wake up in the morning i'm going to
[1212.16 - 1214.96] fight for the chronically ill that's
[1213.76 - 1217.12] what i say that's what i say
[1214.96 - 1218.16] first thing in the morning right i wake
[1217.12 - 1219.36] up in the morning
[1218.16 - 1221.60] i'm going to fight for the chronically
[1219.36 - 1224.24] ill that's what i say
[1221.60 - 1225.12] just like that yeah that's one of my
[1224.24 - 1228.16] mantras
[1225.12 - 1230.48] right april um
[1228.16 - 1232.16] you're the only one who's told me why i
[1230.48 - 1233.44] have eczema it's life-changing
[1232.16 - 1235.84] information
[1233.44 - 1236.88] it millions of people have excellent
[1235.84 - 1238.32] right
[1236.88 - 1240.08] and they don't know why and there's
[1238.32 - 1242.80] people with eczema that don't
[1240.08 - 1244.64] trust they don't trust that maybe
[1242.80 - 1246.32] medical meme information is good because
[1244.64 - 1248.16] some troll got to them right one of
[1246.32 - 1250.80] those trolls that said i tried it it
[1248.16 - 1253.84] didn't work but they never tried it
[1250.80 - 1255.84] right or when some troll comes on in and
[1253.84 - 1257.92] hammers them you know and says no
[1255.84 - 1260.40] don't do the medical medium stuff he
[1257.92 - 1262.72] talks to a ghost or something right
[1260.40 - 1265.12] and you get this you get this and these
[1262.72 - 1267.04] are these are discriminators right these
[1265.12 - 1267.92] are spiritual racists you know and the
[1267.04 - 1269.76] funny thing is
[1267.92 - 1271.28] is everybody's supposed to be so
[1269.76 - 1274.64] spiritual like so
[1271.28 - 1276.56] spiritual right now everybody is just so
[1274.64 - 1278.16] on their game with being spiritual
[1276.56 - 1279.28] that's that's what you see out there now
[1278.16 - 1282.64] right
[1279.28 - 1284.88] but quit to discriminate
[1282.64 - 1286.88] against something that's been working
[1284.88 - 1287.28] for decades now getting people's life
[1286.88 - 1289.60] back
[1287.28 - 1291.76] lives back and healing right and then be
[1289.60 - 1295.44] like no no that guy he's you know he's
[1291.76 - 1296.80] he hears a voice no way that's that's bs
[1295.44 - 1298.88] you know it's like oh i thought you were
[1296.80 - 1301.44] spiritual i thought you can handle that
[1298.88 - 1302.96] you know i thought you can handle that
[1301.44 - 1304.64] you know what i mean you're at your yoga
[1302.96 - 1305.60] class or you're doing whatever you can
[1304.64 - 1308.96] handle that you're
[1305.60 - 1310.96] you're spiritual right and but you know
[1308.96 - 1312.80] it's amazing how that works but there's
[1310.96 - 1314.24] a lot of discrimination and it sets
[1312.80 - 1315.92] people back because
[1314.24 - 1317.60] now someone's going to be afraid to heal
[1315.92 - 1320.00] their ex about meanwhile there's
[1317.60 - 1322.24] tens of thousands of people that got rid
[1320.00 - 1325.04] of their excellent psoriasis
[1322.24 - 1327.12] like how important is that to get rid of
[1325.04 - 1328.40] your eczema your psoriasis it's one of
[1327.12 - 1331.44] the greatest
[1328.40 - 1333.68] greatest precious things that could ever
[1331.44 - 1335.68] happen to someone unless you know what
[1333.68 - 1338.88] it's like to have that bleeding
[1335.68 - 1339.36] cracked skin man and be suffering like
[1338.88 - 1342.72] you are
[1339.36 - 1344.48] unless you know what that's like right
[1342.72 - 1346.64] unless you've been in that person's
[1344.48 - 1349.28] shoes you won't know
[1346.64 - 1351.28] you won't know you know you won't know
[1349.28 - 1353.68] and when you get there someday
[1351.28 - 1354.96] yeah you'll learn fast that guess what
[1353.68 - 1356.80] no one knows what causes x
[1354.96 - 1358.56] psoriasis except medical medium
[1356.80 - 1360.48] information and then when i
[1358.56 - 1362.56] when i hear from somebody and someone
[1360.48 - 1365.20] says hey you know aw
[1362.56 - 1366.24] you know i just saw someone say how
[1365.20 - 1368.32] copper
[1366.24 - 1369.76] is behind eczema but they didn't cite
[1368.32 - 1373.44] you
[1369.76 - 1376.96] that's another problem all on its own
[1373.44 - 1378.72] not citing medical medium information
[1376.96 - 1380.72] so now there's a tidbit of medical beam
[1378.72 - 1383.36] information that gets out there right
[1380.72 - 1384.00] just like the lemon water flushing the
[1383.36 - 1385.92] liver
[1384.00 - 1387.84] medical medium information right but now
[1385.92 - 1389.36] it's it's like common law out there they
[1387.84 - 1390.40] even pretend there's science behind it
[1389.36 - 1391.28] well that's funny because it comes from
[1390.40 - 1393.28] medical medium
[1391.28 - 1395.12] which comes from above which comes from
[1393.28 - 1398.40] spirit of compassion right
[1395.12 - 1401.28] it's like it's like okay um now it's
[1398.40 - 1402.00] yeah this gets copper out of your out of
[1401.28 - 1404.00] your system
[1402.00 - 1405.28] for example copper there's no science of
[1404.00 - 1406.88] research that says copper causes
[1405.28 - 1407.92] exopsrisis that's medical medium
[1406.88 - 1410.48] information
[1407.92 - 1411.20] right and it doesn't get cited the sad
[1410.48 - 1413.28] part about
[1411.20 - 1415.04] it not getting cited is how's that
[1413.28 - 1416.16] person gonna heal now
[1415.04 - 1418.16] they're just going to take somebody's
[1416.16 - 1418.64] gut health product or something and
[1418.16 - 1420.00] still
[1418.64 - 1421.28] or they're going to take somebody else's
[1420.00 - 1422.64] whatever or they're going to take
[1421.28 - 1424.40] something that doesn't work
[1422.64 - 1426.16] like zeolite and they're going to just
[1424.40 - 1426.96] you know and meanwhile they have a
[1426.16 - 1429.28] tidbit
[1426.96 - 1431.20] but the details matter as michelle l
[1429.28 - 1433.60] says and i see your comment
[1431.20 - 1434.32] comment in youtube a lot she says
[1433.60 - 1438.08] details
[1434.32 - 1440.32] matter right and that's what it is it's
[1438.08 - 1442.40] about the details mattering
[1440.32 - 1443.60] is it mattering yeah i'll say it's
[1442.40 - 1446.16] mattering
[1443.60 - 1446.88] and you know the whole thing it's
[1446.16 - 1448.32] important
[1446.88 - 1450.00] so you guys i'm going to put this i
[1448.32 - 1451.36] think these are pretty mashed up pretty
[1450.00 - 1453.68] good actually there we go we'll mash

[1465.12 - 1470.80] you at a retreat
[1467.28 - 1472.24] for being concerned about fat and i
[1470.80 - 1474.16] think someone was putting
[1472.24 - 1476.00] all this fat on top of potatoes or
[1474.16 - 1478.72] something or they told you
[1476.00 - 1479.60] it was okay at the retreat that's what
[1478.72 - 1482.56] they told you
[1479.60 - 1484.56] and then they said why did you do that
[1482.56 - 1486.72] and they shamed you or they shamed you
[1484.56 - 1489.28] the other way around i can't remember
[1486.72 - 1490.56] but i read that story that story hit me
[1489.28 - 1492.32] and it just it just
[1490.56 - 1493.60] the story hit me because it was like
[1492.32 - 1495.44] yeah exactly
[1493.60 - 1496.72] it's not easy out there in the health
[1495.44 - 1497.52] field the way it works you guys i'm
[1496.72 - 1499.68] putting
[1497.52 - 1501.28] my potato on here i just i had a weak
[1499.68 - 1503.36] spoon and it just actually did a little
[1501.28 - 1504.96] snap
[1503.36 - 1507.20] lorraine what do you think about that
[1504.96 - 1510.16] one
[1507.20 - 1512.64] um but i'll tell you right now i'm gonna
[1510.16 - 1514.72] get another spoon in a second
[1512.64 - 1515.92] it's it's really incredible how things
[1514.72 - 1517.76] work
[1515.92 - 1519.04] out there i've seen a lot of that in
[1517.76 - 1522.48] retreats too i've
[1519.04 - 1524.48] seen a lot of shaming go on in retreats
[1522.48 - 1525.92] i'm not saying retreats are bad i'm not
[1524.48 - 1526.84] saying anything like that i'm just
[1525.92 - 1530.16] saying
[1526.84 - 1533.04] validate someone's experience out there
[1530.16 - 1534.72] validate their stories right and that
[1533.04 - 1538.00] leads me to the next part
[1534.72 - 1540.72] right is here you are you
[1538.00 - 1541.76] heal you work your butt off you're doing
[1540.72 - 1545.92] some medical medium
[1541.76 - 1548.16] information okay you're working hard
[1545.92 - 1549.52] you share your story and someone comes
[1548.16 - 1554.84] on there and says
[1549.52 - 1558.88] it didn't happen it didn't happen
[1554.84 - 1563.84] right or it's in a doctor
[1558.88 - 1566.40] or uh it was a sugar pill
[1563.84 - 1567.84] right it was a sugar pill so i'm
[1566.40 - 1568.88] actually got my potatoes in here you
[1567.84 - 1573.04] guys
[1568.88 - 1573.04] i'm gonna replace my wooden spoon
[1574.64 - 1582.56] um that was one of my favorites
[1579.28 - 1584.80] ah here's a there's a nice big wooden
[1582.56 - 1588.00] spoon here
[1584.80 - 1591.28] so and that's another thing too is
[1588.00 - 1596.32] you're not allowed to heal
[1591.28 - 1596.32] um lorraine totally your humor
[1596.56 - 1600.72] most people who say they did mm too
[1598.80 - 1601.52] never read one of the books right
[1600.72 - 1604.00] they'll say
[1601.52 - 1605.92] they'll say you know they never never
[1604.00 - 1606.64] mind all seven of the books they've only
[1605.92 - 1608.40] read like
[1606.64 - 1609.92] no never even read one i've seen that
[1608.40 - 1612.24] before too and the
[1609.92 - 1614.32] the in-depth healing information in the
[1612.24 - 1615.28] books is a whole other thing that's a
[1614.32 - 1618.64] whole other
[1615.28 - 1620.40] but what you'll find is people who heal
[1618.64 - 1622.08] and they work hard and they get rid of
[1620.40 - 1624.00] their lupus their lyme disease with
[1622.08 - 1626.80] medical medium information they get rid
[1624.00 - 1628.72] of their cfs right on clubhouse you guys
[1626.80 - 1633.68] any of you guys got cfs
[1628.72 - 1636.56] cfs me right the brain inflammation
[1633.68 - 1637.28] fibromyalgia how about that one too all
[1636.56 - 1638.80] kinds of gum
[1637.28 - 1640.48] and teeth problems that happen to so
[1638.80 - 1642.24] many people um
[1640.48 - 1644.40] another thing trigeminal neuralgia nerve
[1642.24 - 1648.48] pain back pain neck pain
[1644.40 - 1651.60] head pain right you guys um
[1648.48 - 1651.92] and all of that and i'm cooking these up
[1651.60 - 1653.20] nice
[1651.92 - 1656.88] let's see if i know how to use this
[1653.20 - 1659.44] today the waffle machine
[1656.88 - 1661.52] all right so that's cooking got the
[1659.44 - 1664.32] potato waffles brewing
[1661.52 - 1666.00] so there's so many people out there that
[1664.32 - 1668.40] healed with medical medium information
[1666.00 - 1671.04] but what i'm noticing out there is that
[1668.40 - 1671.92] there's a cult out there and this cult
[1671.04 - 1674.32] is probably
[1671.92 - 1675.44] one of the more evil cults and it's a
[1674.32 - 1678.48] science and research
[1675.44 - 1680.48] cult the science and research cult is
[1678.48 - 1682.64] devised of a bunch of people who haven't
[1680.48 - 1684.64] been sick yet
[1682.64 - 1685.76] and they're there to tell you you didn't
[1684.64 - 1688.16] heal
[1685.76 - 1689.20] because science didn't approve of it
[1688.16 - 1691.68] right
[1689.20 - 1693.36] this is the jim jones cult of all time
[1691.68 - 1695.60] is science research right
[1693.36 - 1697.92] you know like the jim jones cult right
[1695.60 - 1700.64] was was everybody
[1697.92 - 1701.36] took the kool-aid took the sinai and
[1700.64 - 1705.12] they died
[1701.36 - 1708.24] right they killed themselves and
[1705.12 - 1709.04] and it was just a horrifying horrifying
[1708.24 - 1711.68] nightmare
[1709.04 - 1713.36] okay a thousand people they all drink
[1711.68 - 1715.20] kool-aid with cyanide and they go down
[1713.36 - 1717.12] science research is just like that but
[1715.20 - 1720.16] they're the longer
[1717.12 - 1722.96] version they're the micro micro
[1720.16 - 1724.32] dose they're the you're you're drinking
[1722.96 - 1727.68] the science and research
[1724.32 - 1730.16] kool-aid right right and there's a
[1727.68 - 1733.12] little bit of cyanide in there
[1730.16 - 1733.52] but you just don't die fast you just
[1733.12 - 1736.40] stay
[1733.52 - 1737.60] sick and sick while science and research
[1736.40 - 1740.40] strings you out
[1737.60 - 1740.72] and strings you out and then just just
[1740.40 - 1742.64] they
[1740.72 - 1743.76] chip away at your soul that's such
[1742.64 - 1745.44] science and research this just
[1743.76 - 1747.12] chips away at your soul with all their
[1745.44 - 1749.52] paid for fake studies
[1747.12 - 1751.28] and they chip away and then while you're
[1749.52 - 1754.00] waiting on your last breath
[1751.28 - 1754.32] they finally come out with a new report
[1754.00 - 1756.64] they
[1754.32 - 1757.60] finally come out with a new report that
[1756.64 - 1759.92] matcha tea
[1757.60 - 1762.80] has a new antioxidant in it and you just
[1759.92 - 1765.36] lost 30 years of your life
[1762.80 - 1766.80] hanging on by a thread hoping to god
[1765.36 - 1769.92] science and research
[1766.80 - 1772.48] would actually save you and they don't
[1769.92 - 1774.72] they don't they're the ultimate cult
[1772.48 - 1776.40] literally the ultimate cult right now
[1774.72 - 1779.04] you can't break them they're just like
[1776.40 - 1780.80] robot robots in their cult where's your
[1779.04 - 1782.64] science where's your science well that's
[1780.80 - 1783.84] funny because where's your science
[1782.64 - 1785.04] so where's your science where's your
[1783.84 - 1786.56] research that's funny because where's
[1785.04 - 1789.60] your science in research right
[1786.56 - 1792.24] where's yours because what i'm noticing
[1789.60 - 1793.36] now is that people who are saying that
[1792.24 - 1795.52] in the cult
[1793.36 - 1796.96] so all the cult people in there right in
[1795.52 - 1797.92] science research here's what they're
[1796.96 - 1800.16] doing
[1797.92 - 1801.68] they're throwing you a link to a
[1800.16 - 1803.60] citation
[1801.68 - 1804.80] right they're throwing you like a
[1803.60 - 1808.32] citation
[1804.80 - 1811.20] to a paper not even a study
[1808.32 - 1811.84] so you got all these papers out there
[1811.20 - 1814.72] they're just
[1811.84 - 1816.48] they're just observational papers
[1814.72 - 1819.12] there's no conclusion
[1816.48 - 1821.28] there's no facts in them there's nothing
[1819.12 - 1823.76] so the science research cult is so
[1821.28 - 1825.04] twisted and evil they don't even give
[1823.76 - 1827.60] you a study
[1825.04 - 1829.28] you don't even get a study anymore
[1827.60 - 1831.84] there's no studies in there it's an
[1829.28 - 1833.12] article so let's just link an article
[1831.84 - 1834.88] that was hearsay
[1833.12 - 1836.56] and we'll link that we'll throw that in
[1834.88 - 1838.88] somebody's face and say well here's
[1836.56 - 1841.36] here's some science the science research
[1838.88 - 1842.80] cult is actually got to such a dangerous
[1841.36 - 1844.88] point right
[1842.80 - 1846.32] where and they they don't care if
[1844.88 - 1848.88] anybody heals
[1846.32 - 1850.56] they don't want anybody to heal it has
[1848.88 - 1854.00] to be under science's
[1850.56 - 1856.48] jurisdiction right so you guys don't
[1854.00 - 1858.80] deserve to heal
[1856.48 - 1859.76] you don't you don't deserve to heal
[1858.80 - 1862.88] unless science
[1859.76 - 1866.00] says so unless science says
[1862.88 - 1867.60] right and science in the end is a whole
[1866.00 - 1869.60] bunch of paid for theories anyway when
[1867.60 - 1872.64] it comes down to chronic illness
[1869.60 - 1874.56] science isn't math you guys this is so
[1872.64 - 1877.92] important to know
[1874.56 - 1879.04] like science isn't math two plus two is
[1877.92 - 1883.04] four
[1879.04 - 1884.24] science research is two plus two is five
[1883.04 - 1886.08] that's what it is in science and
[1884.24 - 1888.16] research it's
[1886.08 - 1889.28] there it's not math there so when you're
[1888.16 - 1891.68] accountant or
[1889.28 - 1893.28] somebody or somebody you're adding up
[1891.68 - 1895.20] some numbers if you guys are budgeting
[1893.28 - 1896.72] yourselves out for the week right
[1895.20 - 1898.80] if you're budgeting yourselves out for
[1896.72 - 1900.64] the week and trying to figure out what
[1898.80 - 1901.52] and how would i pay for groceries this
[1900.64 - 1903.60] week and
[1901.52 - 1905.04] what do i need to how do i pay the light
[1903.60 - 1907.92] bill keep that on
[1905.04 - 1910.16] light bill is 37 dollars and 42 cents
[1907.92 - 1912.96] let me pay the light bill right
[1910.16 - 1914.40] science research is not that it's a
[1912.96 - 1918.48] theory
[1914.40 - 1919.28] compounded by money hungry beasts behind
[1918.48 - 1921.60] there
[1919.28 - 1922.64] that makes scientists do what they tell

[2651.52 - 2654.80] to heal
[2652.56 - 2656.16] and we're not gonna take any crap and
[2654.80 - 2658.64] that's just the bottom line
[2656.16 - 2660.24] it's like you know a friend of mine says
[2658.64 - 2662.00] don't wake him up
[2660.24 - 2664.00] the guy's already worked for 35 years
[2662.00 - 2667.68] he's worked his butt off he's
[2664.00 - 2671.52] a large part of the alternative medicine
[2667.68 - 2674.32] foundations built off of his back
[2671.52 - 2675.20] and he did it without wanting to take
[2674.32 - 2676.96] the credit
[2675.20 - 2678.24] because he lives a spiritual life he
[2676.96 - 2681.60] listens to a spiritual
[2678.24 - 2684.24] source and it's like it's like
[2681.60 - 2686.16] don't wake him up though right and
[2684.24 - 2688.40] that's what they continue to do
[2686.16 - 2690.48] so they get mad because they're they get
[2688.40 - 2692.80] mad because they're selling their stuff
[2690.48 - 2695.12] and they're like well he he's he's he's
[2692.80 - 2697.84] trying to protect pregnant women
[2695.12 - 2700.16] he's trying to protect pregnant women
[2697.84 - 2703.20] and not let them eat cacao
[2700.16 - 2705.12] right while they're pregnant but
[2703.20 - 2706.72] that's making us look bad because we
[2705.12 - 2707.92] tell pregnant women they can have all
[2706.72 - 2710.72] the chocolate they want
[2707.92 - 2712.32] and they can get their baby all high
[2710.72 - 2714.48] right

[2910.96 - 2914.08] not
[2911.84 - 2915.92] the problem is i know why you're sick
[2914.08 - 2918.56] they don't
[2915.92 - 2919.20] they don't know why you're sick they can
[2918.56 - 2921.92] play in
[2919.20 - 2925.20] any realm they want and try to bank on
[2921.92 - 2926.72] anything they want and bank and bank
[2925.20 - 2928.88] they could do all their subscription
[2926.72 - 2930.56] charges on all their websites
[2928.88 - 2933.20] they can do whatever they can make you
[2930.56 - 2936.48] you have to pay 400
[2933.20 - 2940.88] to sign into something right
[2936.48 - 2943.20] okay and the science websites because
[2940.88 - 2945.76] you're desperate to heal and you pay 400
[2943.20 - 2947.28] and 200 and 700 you sign up to the
[2945.76 - 2948.16] website so you can surf through their
[2947.28 - 2951.44] papers of
[2948.16 - 2952.96] junk right and not get answers
[2951.44 - 2955.04] and then in the end they got a little
[2952.96 - 2956.16] product area and maybe i'll buy this
[2955.04 - 2959.20] like special
[2956.16 - 2962.16] cider vinegar maybe i'll buy this other
[2959.20 - 2962.96] fish oil they have with their their
[2962.16 - 2966.00] their bs
[2962.96 - 2967.68] claims and stuff and nobody's looking
[2966.00 - 2969.20] out for the mommies the babies no one's
[2967.68 - 2970.40] looking out for the people who are sick
[2969.20 - 2972.96] nobody's looking out they don't even
[2970.40 - 2975.28] know why you're sick
[2972.96 - 2976.56] it's unbelievable when you think about
[2975.28 - 2979.20] it
[2976.56 - 2981.28] debbie loves stone why is coffee enema
[2979.20 - 2984.24] and diatomaceous earth not good how do
[2981.28 - 2986.48] these two things cause harm to the body
[2984.24 - 2988.00] okay first of all coffee enema let's
[2986.48 - 2990.80] just cover that real quick right there
[2988.00 - 2991.68] while we're right here anyway right your
[2990.80 - 2995.20] stomach
[2991.68 - 2997.12] is there to buffer a poison caffeine
[2995.20 - 2998.96] is a psychoactive drug that we're not
[2997.12 - 3002.16] supposed to consume
[2998.96 - 3003.44] it ages women quickly beats their
[3002.16 - 3005.28] adrenal glands down
[3003.44 - 3007.04] gives them difficult pregnancies and
[3005.28 - 3009.12] births for baby births
[3007.04 - 3011.60] and it causes all kinds of wrinkles in
[3009.12 - 3013.84] the skin sun spots malaysia
[3011.60 - 3015.20] all that on the skin and hair loss for
[3013.84 - 3017.20] women right because women aren't
[3015.20 - 3019.20] technically supposed to lose their hair
[3017.20 - 3021.44] they're not supposed to
[3019.20 - 3023.20] okay it's not like men right women are
[3021.44 - 3025.04] not supposed to lose their hair
[3023.20 - 3026.64] but they lose it because of caffeine
[3025.04 - 3028.48] that's one reason why they lose it their
[3026.64 - 3029.12] adrenals get beaten down by other things
[3028.48 - 3031.60] but
[3029.12 - 3033.36] caffeine is really a poison right and
[3031.60 - 3035.12] then it keeps them high and addicted and
[3033.36 - 3036.72] they spend a whole life addicted and
[3035.12 - 3038.24] that's how the caffeine industry wants
[3036.72 - 3040.40] them they want them addicted but
[3038.24 - 3041.60] what goes wrong with when it's a coffee
[3040.40 - 3045.52] enema
[3041.60 - 3048.56] is nothing's buffering that poison
[3045.52 - 3051.52] from getting to your liver and brain
[3048.56 - 3052.64] one when you put that coffee up the back
[3051.52 - 3055.36] end
[3052.64 - 3056.32] nothing buffers it for your brain and
[3055.36 - 3058.48] heart
[3056.32 - 3059.68] it goes into shock including your liver
[3058.48 - 3063.12] it goes into shock
[3059.68 - 3066.48] when it when you drink it the lining
[3063.12 - 3069.60] of your mouth your esophagus okay
[3066.48 - 3072.32] your stomach and your duodenum
[3069.60 - 3073.20] are pretty darn strong for a reason
[3072.32 - 3075.68] they're there
[3073.20 - 3077.04] to buffer a poison because here's the
[3075.68 - 3077.52] deal you guys want to hear something
[3077.04 - 3081.44] cool
[3077.52 - 3084.16] okay back thousands of years ago
[3081.44 - 3086.08] and even not even that far right we
[3084.16 - 3090.16] survived by saying
[3086.08 - 3092.72] i'm hungry i see a plant on the ground
[3090.16 - 3095.44] with a weird berry
[3092.72 - 3096.88] i'm gonna risk my life and bite that
[3095.44 - 3098.64] berry
[3096.88 - 3100.08] and everybody standing around me is
[3098.64 - 3100.56] gonna say you're either gonna live or
[3100.08 - 3102.96] die
[3100.56 - 3106.00] and if you live we might be able to eat
[3102.96 - 3107.60] that food did you know that
[3106.00 - 3109.36] human beings have thousands of years of
[3107.60 - 3111.84] that right
[3109.36 - 3112.88] trial by era making mistakes in the food
[3111.84 - 3115.44] you pick
[3112.88 - 3116.40] you eat that berry and if that berries
[3115.44 - 3118.08] poisonous
[3116.40 - 3119.60] you die right in front of your family
[3118.08 - 3123.52] and everybody else
[3119.60 - 3126.64] right or you get poisoned sick right
[3123.52 - 3130.00] that's how it works but your stomach
[3126.64 - 3134.00] is the buffer the buffer your stomach
[3130.00 - 3138.32] is engineered naturally
[3134.00 - 3141.04] not synthetically not gmo engineered
[3138.32 - 3141.92] it's engineered in a way created in a
[3141.04 - 3144.96] way
[3141.92 - 3145.76] to buffer what poison can possibly enter
[3144.96 - 3149.68] it
[3145.76 - 3150.08] right so i'm gonna eat that root because
[3149.68 - 3153.04] i'm
[3150.08 - 3153.60] starving to death whatever climate or
[3153.04 - 3156.08] area i
[3153.60 - 3158.48] am on the planet i'm starving my butt
[3156.08 - 3160.80] off it's make or break do or die
[3158.48 - 3162.48] i better just eat those shoots i just
[3160.80 - 3164.64] found that popped up in
[3162.48 - 3166.96] in the springtime because if i don't eat
[3164.64 - 3169.28] those shoots i'm in trouble
[3166.96 - 3171.44] you pluck those shoots out and you risk
[3169.28 - 3175.52] your life on them that's how it's done
[3171.44 - 3178.64] back then right i'm gonna eat
[3175.52 - 3180.64] that mushroom it looks good
[3178.64 - 3182.64] it's sitting there i don't know if it's
[3180.64 - 3185.52] a poisonous mushroom or not
[3182.64 - 3187.04] but i'm gonna eat it and that's how it
[3185.52 - 3189.04] was done all these years
[3187.04 - 3190.56] nobody knew different they didn't know
[3189.04 - 3191.76] if this was poisonous or not
[3190.56 - 3194.40] they didn't know you could eat this or
[3191.76 - 3196.24] not eat that they didn't know
[3194.40 - 3197.84] but your stomach buffered the poison it
[3196.24 - 3201.68] gave you a chance to not
[3197.84 - 3203.12] die fast right caffeine is a poison and
[3201.68 - 3205.52] the stomach is built to
[3203.12 - 3206.24] buffer it to a degree so it can't hit
[3205.52 - 3208.48] the brain
[3206.24 - 3210.24] fast enough it can't hit the brain it
[3208.48 - 3212.40] can't hit the heart fast enough
[3210.24 - 3214.48] you don't get the brain and heart rush
[3212.40 - 3216.08] fast because those are the two organs
[3214.48 - 3218.56] that your stomach is trying to protect
[3216.08 - 3219.68] you from i mean to protect poisons from
[3218.56 - 3223.44] getting to
[3219.68 - 3226.88] right and so what happens is
[3223.44 - 3230.00] that you put you put a poison up your
[3226.88 - 3233.12] back end you put poison
[3230.00 - 3236.88] into your rectum you get poison
[3233.12 - 3239.12] into your colon from behind
[3236.88 - 3239.92] right there's no buffer it's not built
[3239.12 - 3243.28] like that
[3239.92 - 3245.60] no buffer at all at all it goes directly
[3243.28 - 3249.28] into the bloodstream in an instant
[3245.60 - 3250.88] there's nothing to buffer that caffeine
[3249.28 - 3252.80] anybody who's okay and here's the other
[3250.88 - 3256.32] thing why are you doing a coffee enema
[3252.80 - 3257.92] doing a coffee enema because you're sick
[3256.32 - 3259.52] you think anybody's gonna just do a
[3257.92 - 3260.96] coffee animal when they're feeling fine
[3259.52 - 3262.96] and life's great they're playing playing
[3260.96 - 3264.40] tennis and drinking their margaritas
[3262.96 - 3266.80] and drinking their glasses of
[3264.40 - 3267.44] champagne life is good and they can do
[3266.80 - 3269.12] what they want
[3267.44 - 3270.56] go where they want exercise when they
[3269.12 - 3272.00] want sleep when they want
[3270.56 - 3273.20] do anything they want right you think
[3272.00 - 3274.48] they're gonna go rush out and get a
[3273.20 - 3277.12] coffee enema
[3274.48 - 3278.64] no we do it because we're sick and we're
[3277.12 - 3281.52] looking for answers and now we're on the
[3278.64 - 3284.32] road looking for coffee enemas now
[3281.52 - 3285.60] but what goes wrong is that when you do
[3284.32 - 3288.48] the coffee enema
[3285.60 - 3291.68] you kill your adrenals the adrenals get
[3288.48 - 3294.56] a direct attack of caffeine
[3291.68 - 3296.96] and it causes them to blow out and if
[3294.56 - 3299.12] your nervous system is weak tingles and
[3296.96 - 3300.96] numbness maybe you have aches and pains
[3299.12 - 3301.36] what do you got neck pain back pain head
[3300.96 - 3303.36] pain
[3301.36 - 3305.20] what do you got what do you guys got you
[3303.36 - 3306.80] got tingles numbness ringing in the ears
[3305.20 - 3308.24] well you got anxiety tightness in the
[3306.80 - 3310.48] chest tightness in the throat
[3308.24 - 3312.32] what do you have we have jaw pain teeth
[3310.48 - 3315.04] pain what do you guys got
[3312.32 - 3316.96] right you know ethel says i really like
[3315.04 - 3318.96] this guy hey i'm honored
[3316.96 - 3320.16] i'm so glad you're here you seem fine to
[3318.96 - 3323.60] he says chris
[3320.16 - 3325.44] no one puts it this way right
[3323.60 - 3327.52] what do you got wrong with you
[3325.44 - 3329.44] depression anxiety depersonalization
[3327.52 - 3332.24] bipolar
[3329.44 - 3333.52] what are you dealing with fatigue uh
[3332.24 - 3335.52] blurry vision
[3333.52 - 3337.12] uh floaters in the eyes flashing lights
[3335.52 - 3338.32] in your eyes and head
[3337.12 - 3340.24] are you what are you dealing with
[3338.32 - 3341.84] insomnia back pain
[3340.24 - 3343.44] feet pain plantar fasciitis what are you
[3341.84 - 3345.28] dealing with well guess what
[3343.44 - 3347.44] those are all nervous system stuff all
[3345.28 - 3349.28] nervous system you put coffee in you
[3347.44 - 3350.96] that's caffeine that jacks up your
[3349.28 - 3353.44] adrenals both caffeine and your
[3350.96 - 3355.44] adrenaline destroy your nervous system
[3353.44 - 3357.20] so let's just put coffee up the back end
[3355.44 - 3357.68] because nobody knows why anybody's sick
[3357.20 - 3360.88] anyway
[3357.68 - 3362.88] think about that every single clinic or
[3360.88 - 3363.92] anywhere or anybody who had the idea of
[3362.88 - 3366.08] putting coffee
[3363.92 - 3367.84] up somebody's behind didn't even know
[3366.08 - 3369.68] why you were even in there to begin with
[3367.84 - 3372.24] sick with your neurological symptoms
[3369.68 - 3373.68] how stupid can you get not the people
[3372.24 - 3376.80] getting the coffee enema
[3373.68 - 3380.24] the people out there delving it out like
[3376.80 - 3382.96] without even a fraction of understanding
[3380.24 - 3383.84] right but the answers are here they
[3382.96 - 3385.36] exist
[3383.84 - 3386.80] there's thousands of doctors around the
[3385.36 - 3388.32] world using medical media books and
[3386.80 - 3389.60] learning this so they don't put their
[3388.32 - 3392.56] patients through it
[3389.60 - 3394.48] right but the more and more people that
[3392.56 - 3394.80] get healed the more and more censored i
[3394.48 - 3396.96] get
[3394.80 - 3398.24] the more more people that heal the more
[3396.96 - 3402.96] and more the world says
[3398.24 - 3404.80] whoa that's just too many now
[3402.96 - 3406.40] how can this guy's information be
[3404.80 - 3408.32] healing that many people
[3406.40 - 3410.64] because it's uncool we have to shut this
[3408.32 - 3413.92] down we have to calm it down
[3410.64 - 3414.40] you know and i was given this gift for
[3413.92 - 3416.64] you
[3414.40 - 3418.96] i'm not a smart guy and i told you guys
[3416.64 - 3420.80] over and over again
[3418.96 - 3422.64] monica says plantar fasciitis caused by
[3420.80 - 3423.76] coffee no not at all but it's a really
[3422.64 - 3425.20] good question that's caused by
[3423.76 - 3426.56] epstein-barr
[3425.20 - 3428.64] plantar fasciitis is caused by
[3426.56 - 3430.72] epstein-barr it's a nerve inflammation
[3428.64 - 3432.16] caused by low-grade viral infections
[3430.72 - 3434.48] coffee just
[3432.16 - 3436.24] keeps it around and makes it worse and
[3434.48 - 3439.52] agitates it
[3436.24 - 3441.12] that's what it does and coffee weakens
[3439.52 - 3443.12] the central nervous system and plantar
[3441.12 - 3445.28] fasciitis is your nervous system your
[3443.12 - 3448.08] tibial nerve
[3445.28 - 3449.20] just gets inflamed right digital nerve
[3448.08 - 3451.36] just gets inflamed
[3449.20 - 3452.72] all of that it could be coffee much
[3451.36 - 3454.40] teach chocolate the whole bit listen to
[3452.72 - 3455.92] the podcast that medical mean podcast at
[3454.40 - 3458.88] apple podcast you guys
