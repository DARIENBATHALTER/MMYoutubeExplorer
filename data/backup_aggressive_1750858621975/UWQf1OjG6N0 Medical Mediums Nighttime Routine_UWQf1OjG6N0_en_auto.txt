[110.16 - 114.54] down to it so I want to take my steps my
[112.32 - 117.48] here's the nighttime routine it's
[114.54 - 119.10] starting right I'm here and no I didn't
[117.48 - 120.54] come back from the hospital just now
[119.10 - 122.82] that's not what this is this is my
[120.54 - 124.38] pajamas so I didn't just come back from
[122.82 - 127.98] the hospital right where's my hospital
[124.38 - 130.32] tag so anyway no these are my pajamas
[127.98 - 133.80] man so let's get started with this this
[130.32 - 135.78] immune system that's what I'm talking
[133.80 - 139.08] about right now and that's what's
[135.78 - 141.24] connected spiritually to my nighttime
[139.08 - 143.04] routine so I want to go into that a
[141.24 - 144.42] little bit so let me just start right so
[143.04 - 146.88] there's some cats call I'm going to pop
[144.42 - 149.22] some in this little shot glass right so
[146.88 - 152.10] here it is right nighttime routine
[149.22 - 155.10] putting some cat's claw in cat's claw
[152.10 - 157.14] right supports the immune system I'm
[155.10 - 159.00] gonna put some propolis in here too
[157.14 - 160.74] which is cool about Provost I like also
[159.00 - 162.62] just putting it straight in the mouth
[160.74 - 166.14] it's good for oral health which is
[162.62 - 168.06] amazing about propolis too right and
[166.14 - 170.94] supports the immune system
[168.06 - 173.64] here's the zinc
[170.94 - 175.80] right thing is with zinc and I've said
[173.64 - 177.72] this over and over again I've said this
[175.80 - 179.88] over and over again about the zinc okay
[177.72 - 183.60] going all the way back
[179.88 - 186.68] it's great for every aspect of our body
[183.60 - 191.70] zinc is one of those essential minerals
[186.68 - 194.28] that our entire body needs right one of
[191.70 - 196.32] the essential minerals for health so
[194.28 - 199.80] I've been saying that about saying man
[196.32 - 202.74] going all the way back so right here
[199.80 - 206.88] it's immune system right zinc propolis
[202.74 - 208.44] cat's claw okay nettle leaf now nettle
[206.88 - 210.60] Leaf is great for a lot of things like
[208.44 - 212.22] urinary supports urinary tract but I
[210.60 - 214.32] like it for immune system
[212.22 - 216.24] so that's important right there
[214.32 - 218.58] I got the nettle Leaf going right there
[216.24 - 220.02] okay so that's an immune system shot
[218.58 - 223.02] right there let me get a little bit of
[220.02 - 226.14] water so I want to take this shot it's
[223.02 - 230.48] part of my nighttime routine right here
[226.14 - 230.48] so I'm gonna shoot this down now
[231.60 - 237.12] here's how it goes
[234.84 - 238.44] now I'm going to have dinner and stuff
[237.12 - 240.42] I'll make some Dory rolls but I'm just
[238.44 - 241.74] kind of like jostling things around a
[240.42 - 242.58] little bit in my routine but I want to
[241.74 - 245.34] tell you
[242.58 - 246.54] what happens is has that entered my body
[245.34 - 248.94] right now
[246.54 - 252.36] I'm connecting to it it's really
[248.94 - 255.54] important so I'll tell you what happens
[252.36 - 256.86] the minute that goes down and into me
[255.54 - 258.54] right
[256.86 - 261.54] I can feel it
[258.54 - 264.90] because I like being in tuned
[261.54 - 268.74] to the supplementation that I'm taking
[264.90 - 272.76] that my body's receiving so I like to be
[268.74 - 274.20] so in tuned that I like to Envision my
[272.76 - 276.84] immune cells
[274.20 - 278.76] right away when that stuff is going in
[276.84 - 281.82] me because that's important right there
[278.76 - 284.40] so my immune system right
[281.82 - 287.94] so right when I take
[284.40 - 291.72] that shot and I sent that down
[287.94 - 295.38] I align it instantly to visualizing my
[291.72 - 297.42] immune cells my white blood cells that's
[295.38 - 299.52] important and then
[297.42 - 301.26] I go about my business for the rest of
[299.52 - 303.06] the night a little bit right winding
[301.26 - 306.30] down I'm making my meal getting myself
[303.06 - 310.56] ready but when I go to bed
[306.30 - 313.32] when I go to bed and I hop in bed
[310.56 - 316.44] right put the blanket over me
[313.32 - 317.94] and I close my eyes I shut the light off
[316.44 - 320.04] and close my eyes
[317.94 - 321.84] I envision
[320.04 - 325.70] a white blood cell
[321.84 - 325.70] and I Envision that white blood cell
[325.86 - 330.84] floating around
[327.78 - 335.10] so this is the visualization I do right
[330.84 - 338.88] so I'm seeing that white blood cell
[335.10 - 342.60] floating around while I'm actually
[338.88 - 344.82] getting ready to fall asleep
[342.60 - 347.46] and I'm envisioning it right
[344.82 - 350.82] and this is what I do every night for
[347.46 - 353.40] years that's my immune system right
[350.82 - 357.72] there now then
[353.40 - 359.58] I connect to the immune
[357.72 - 361.92] support
[359.58 - 364.38] that I took
[361.92 - 367.86] I connect to the propolis
[364.38 - 369.24] I connect to the cat's claw I connect to
[367.86 - 372.00] the zinc
[369.24 - 375.48] I connect to the nettle leaf
[372.00 - 378.84] right and I'm connecting to it and then
[375.48 - 382.02] I'm seeing my white blood cells receive
[378.84 - 384.96] that Incredible Gift
[382.02 - 386.36] that incredible power
[384.96 - 389.34] it's just
[386.36 - 391.38] consuming it and I visualize this now
[389.34 - 395.22] here's the incredible thing too and then
[391.38 - 398.16] I visualize my white blood cells with my
[395.22 - 401.52] eyes closed falling asleep with the
[398.16 - 404.82] light off I envisualize right
[401.52 - 405.90] I see the white blood cells gobbling up
[404.82 - 409.02] toxins
[405.90 - 411.60] gobbling up poisons and toxins that's
[409.02 - 415.20] what I see I see it start to gobble up
[411.60 - 418.86] those poisons and those toxins right
[415.20 - 423.18] and that's what I do and I lay there and
[418.86 - 424.74] I connect to my body and I connect to
[423.18 - 427.74] the purity
[424.74 - 431.04] of what I took
[427.74 - 432.84] because I don't have to worry too about
[431.04 - 434.22] stuff being in these supplements which
[432.84 - 436.56] I'm going to talk about stuff that
[434.22 - 438.00] shouldn't be there so I don't have to
[436.56 - 440.22] worry about that and I'm going to talk
[438.00 - 442.02] about that in a second as well but this
[440.22 - 444.60] visualization
[442.02 - 446.40] and connects to the affirmations I also
[444.60 - 448.98] say for myself like
[446.40 - 453.78] my white blood cells I see them
[448.98 - 456.36] I can see them floating across my vision
[453.78 - 459.48] my eyes closed and I can see those white
[456.36 - 463.98] blood cells gobbling things up that
[459.48 - 466.50] should not be inside my body toxins and
[463.98 - 468.36] poisons because we're exposed to so many
[466.50 - 471.06] toxins and poisons out there so I'm
[468.36 - 474.42] watching my white blood cells eat that
[471.06 - 476.22] up as I'm falling asleep right and then
[474.42 - 478.86] I talk to him I talk to my immune system
[476.22 - 480.48] I talk to my immune cells and I tell my
[478.86 - 483.18] white blood cells
[480.48 - 486.72] that they're doing an amazing job and I
[483.18 - 489.84] say in an affirmation way I go
[486.72 - 492.90] okay I go my white blood cells are
[489.84 - 496.38] powerful they're strong
[492.90 - 499.08] my white blood cells are unstoppable
[496.38 - 501.84] and I'll even say you guys are
[499.08 - 502.92] unstoppable you're powerful white blood
[501.84 - 507.00] cells
[502.92 - 511.28] nothing gets in your way you can you can
[507.00 - 514.98] gobble up digest and eat up
[511.28 - 517.80] and completely destroy toxins and
[514.98 - 519.90] poisons and I know you're doing that and
[517.80 - 522.78] I do the affirmations with my immune
[519.90 - 524.40] system which is really powerful and the
[522.78 - 526.14] affirmations with the immune system is
[524.40 - 530.40] really powerful
[526.14 - 531.48] watching those immune cells across my
[530.40 - 533.22] eyes
[531.48 - 535.50] gobbling up
[533.22 - 537.12] all the different toxins and poisons and
[535.50 - 539.58] I talked to my immune cells and I see
[537.12 - 543.18] did I feed you guys
[539.58 - 545.16] right and then I Envision that my immune
[543.18 - 548.04] system can speak
[545.16 - 549.36] and they're saying yes you gave us what
[548.04 - 552.36] we needed
[549.36 - 556.44] which is really powerful really powerful
[552.36 - 558.30] right there so what I do is I the Lee my
[556.44 - 561.30] nighttime routine changes
[558.30 - 563.70] it shifts right now this is it for now
[561.30 - 565.74] but then it shifts different
[563.70 - 568.56] supplementation different times
[565.74 - 570.48] different seasons different stress in my
[568.56 - 572.10] life what kind of stress do you guys
[570.48 - 574.02] have in your life what are you guys up
[572.10 - 577.44] against I know that I'm up against a lot
[574.02 - 579.72] of stress I work 22 hour days 20 hour
[577.44 - 583.68] days 18 hour days
[579.72 - 585.90] I worked 24-hour days sometimes which is
[583.68 - 588.06] not really a great idea either but I do
[585.90 - 590.04] it I got deadlines I got
[588.06 - 592.86] responsibilities there are lots of
[590.04 - 594.30] people relying on me so what what I do
[592.86 - 597.90] because someone might say oh you do a
[594.30 - 601.02] lot for your nighttime routine yeah and
[597.90 - 603.78] I have tremendous responsibility I have
[601.02 - 605.46] people relying on me I got the world
[603.78 - 609.24] relying on me for getting the
[605.46 - 611.16] information from SOC out to everybody so
[609.24 - 612.84] that information's there and that's
[611.16 - 614.76] always a fight and a struggle to get
[612.84 - 616.74] that out there in the world because the
[614.76 - 618.24] world it's how it is it's hard to get
[616.74 - 621.24] information out there right it's a lot
[618.24 - 622.98] of work and so all of that there's a lot
[621.24 - 625.44] of responsibilities plus personal life
[622.98 - 628.38] stuff right that everybody has
[625.44 - 629.52] and so with that it changes and it Ebbs
[628.38 - 632.82] and flows
[629.52 - 634.02] but right now what I'm doing supporting
[632.82 - 635.76] my immune system is one of the things
[634.02 - 637.20] I'm doing right what I love about the
[635.76 - 640.86] propolis
[637.20 - 643.56] the energy propolis right is it has up
[640.86 - 646.38] to over 50 percent
[643.56 - 649.20] of the polyphenols right
[646.38 - 650.52] after polyphenols are in the propolis
[649.20 - 652.08] which is incredible one of them is
[650.52 - 654.14] quercetin so that's actually an
[652.08 - 657.66] acropolis which I really love right
[654.14 - 660.60] Central it's essential in my opinion
[657.66 - 663.54] right I take it for antioxidant support
[660.60 - 666.60] I take it for my immune system and
[663.54 - 668.58] here's what's cool no propylene glycol
[666.60 - 670.02] in here and that's going to lead me to
[668.58 - 671.84] something I want to tell you guys which
[670.02 - 677.18] is really incredible but no propylene
[671.84 - 680.16] glycol in here and they do a specialized
[677.18 - 682.74] specialized process which is amazing a
[680.16 - 684.72] pic like which is incredible what they
[682.74 - 687.24] do as far as the pro unique
[684.72 - 689.46] um unique purification process which
[687.24 - 691.86] doesn't exist anywhere else from what
[689.46 - 694.32] I've heard so it's really amazing their
[691.86 - 697.50] stuff so I want to talk about
[694.32 - 700.14] some cool things with this now four
[697.50 - 702.72] reasons why support
[700.14 - 704.52] the vimergy company right and four
[702.72 - 706.32] reasons why I fully endorsed them and
[704.52 - 709.56] working with them I got to tell you
[706.32 - 713.06] one is and you be the judge to this
[709.56 - 715.50] okay right one is
[713.06 - 719.64] label requirements
[715.50 - 721.68] just so you know label requirements for
[719.64 - 724.92] supplement companies
[721.68 - 728.64] does not require the supplement company
[724.92 - 732.42] right to list or disclose
[728.64 - 734.70] all the ingredients inside the bottle
[732.42 - 736.68] I'll repeat myself right there
[734.70 - 738.84] label requirements right for supplement
[736.68 - 741.66] companies don't require
[738.84 - 743.40] all the ingredients in the product to be
[741.66 - 745.02] disclosed
[743.40 - 747.72] just so you know
[745.02 - 749.16] keep it in mind they can have a small
[747.72 - 751.86] percentage
[749.16 - 755.28] of ingredients in this supplementation
[751.86 - 757.86] out there that they don't disclose
[755.28 - 761.46] that you don't know about like flow
[757.86 - 765.00] agents things like flow agents
[761.46 - 766.98] exactly and other ingredients Bemidji
[765.00 - 769.98] they vowed
[766.98 - 771.50] okay they would never do that they would
[769.98 - 775.08] never put
[771.50 - 777.24] undisclosed hidden ingredients are
[775.08 - 782.10] hidden flow agents or anything like that
[777.24 - 784.14] in their products that alone right there
[782.10 - 786.12] because I've never seen that anywhere
[784.14 - 788.28] else in my opinion when my in my life
[786.12 - 792.54] I've never seen it that right there is
[788.28 - 796.38] like drop the mic it's drop the mic
[792.54 - 799.26] because I'm about connecting to the
[796.38 - 802.86] stuff I consume spiritually emotionally
[799.26 - 806.10] that's what I'm about right and so when
[802.86 - 807.60] people who know me like really dear dear
[806.10 - 809.22] family members or friends they know that
[807.60 - 811.92] it's all about like that spiritual
[809.22 - 814.98] connection with everything I do right so
[811.92 - 818.64] it's all about the purification too okay
[814.98 - 821.28] so when I take something for my immune
[818.64 - 823.32] for immune support right when I do that
[821.28 - 824.82] and I'm envisioning that white blood
[823.32 - 828.12] cell
[824.82 - 830.40] on connecting to the Purity factor of
[828.12 - 832.26] what I put in my body too
[830.40 - 835.02] I'm connecting to the fact that there's
[832.26 - 837.96] no flow agents there's no hidden
[835.02 - 840.84] ingredients that are not being disclosed
[837.96 - 843.24] right and so that's what I'm connecting
[840.84 - 844.86] to when I take the memory stuff so it's
[843.24 - 848.04] like you know what it's high time just
[844.86 - 850.08] full endorsement boom I stand behind the
[848.04 - 853.02] company I want people in the world to be
[850.08 - 856.38] able to have the opportunity to have the
[853.02 - 858.12] same opportunity that I have which is
[856.38 - 860.76] knowing I'm getting that pureness inside
[858.12 - 863.58] my body and then connecting to that
[860.76 - 864.36] pureness which is which is critical for
[863.58 - 865.62] me
[864.36 - 867.72] right
[865.62 - 870.54] I need to know there isn't something
[867.72 - 872.40] hidden there isn't something tricky
[870.54 - 874.26] going on even if it's legal even it's
[872.40 - 876.66] legal because label requirements they
[874.26 - 878.82] legally make it so you can hide and
[876.66 - 881.10] disclose you don't you can hide and not
[878.82 - 886.44] disclose certain stuff small percentage
[881.10 - 888.90] but vimoji goes above legal requirements
[886.44 - 891.18] and they don't put anything like that in
[888.90 - 892.92] there that's hidden in small percentages
[891.18 - 894.90] and they always disclose everything
[892.92 - 897.06] that's in there that's incredible so
[894.90 - 899.64] that's one thing by the way so be the
[897.06 - 903.18] judge on this next one okay
[899.64 - 905.64] be the judge on this next one this is
[903.18 - 908.40] another connection I have spiritually to
[905.64 - 911.64] the products for me when I know I'm
[908.40 - 914.46] putting it in my body okay my opinion my
[911.64 - 917.40] life my spiritual connection my soul
[914.46 - 919.62] right listen to this one be the judge on
[917.40 - 922.32] this one which is interesting very cheap
[919.62 - 925.34] products have no alcohol
[922.32 - 929.58] no alcohol no soy
[925.34 - 931.92] contains no gluten no citric acid no

[941.46 - 946.80] no artificial flavors no titanium
[944.82 - 949.08] dioxide just going to say it one more
[946.80 - 950.82] time because it's insane
[949.08 - 952.14] that's insane when I think about it
[950.82 - 954.42] because
[952.14 - 956.34] I've seen a lot of supplementation out
[954.42 - 957.36] there in the world all right from what
[956.34 - 961.08] I've seen
[957.36 - 963.36] no alcohol no soy no glue no citric acid
[961.08 - 966.06] no maltodextrin maltodextrin is almost
[963.36 - 968.82] virtually almost in almost everything
[966.06 - 971.28] virtually almost in everything
[968.82 - 973.68] Healthcare and people don't know that no
[971.28 - 976.92] magnesium steroid no vinegar no caffeine
[973.68 - 979.14] no natural flavors natural flavors
[976.92 - 982.26] is in virtually almost everything now
[979.14 - 984.06] out there in one way form or another
[982.26 - 986.10] even if it says like organic natural
[984.06 - 988.38] flavors or natural flavors or whatever
[986.10 - 990.06] right no artificial flavors in it no
[988.38 - 992.52] titanium dioxide that's the second thing
[990.06 - 995.34] be the judge on that one but let me tell
[992.52 - 997.04] you the connection I have knowing that
[995.34 - 1001.22] when I recommend
[997.04 - 1004.10] this product line to a family member a
[1001.22 - 1007.04] friend a dear loved one anybody what I
[1004.10 - 1009.44] recommend it to someone that I'm not
[1007.04 - 1011.12] worried because I have people I have
[1009.44 - 1013.52] friends I have family contact me say hey
[1011.12 - 1015.50] I'm taking this I'm taking this whatever
[1013.52 - 1016.94] and I'll be like oh can you look at the
[1015.50 - 1019.04] back of the bottle they said yeah it
[1016.94 - 1021.56] says alcohol it says caffeine in here it
[1019.04 - 1023.36] says it says um gluten in here it says
[1021.56 - 1025.28] whatever you know vinegar in here it
[1023.36 - 1027.16] says natural flavors in here it says
[1025.28 - 1029.06] titanium dioxide in here it says
[1027.16 - 1031.22] maltodextrin in there and all these
[1029.06 - 1033.68] things and then I I is a Consciousness
[1031.22 - 1034.88] kind of level so what happens is when
[1033.68 - 1035.90] people say what do you do in your
[1034.88 - 1037.22] personal life well I'm doing my
[1035.90 - 1040.10] nighttime routine I'm showing you guys
[1037.22 - 1042.38] but I'm telling you something that I
[1040.10 - 1044.12] don't talk to people about it's it's
[1042.38 - 1045.98] kind of private to me in my life
[1044.12 - 1048.38] absolutely but I wanted to tell you is
[1045.98 - 1051.08] there's a spiritual connection I do with
[1048.38 - 1054.02] everything in my life and there is a
[1051.08 - 1056.36] soul connection and a Consciousness I
[1054.02 - 1059.30] have to connect with to my soul about
[1056.36 - 1060.98] purify application and Purity and things
[1059.30 - 1063.32] like that and so if I'm going to put
[1060.98 - 1066.62] something in my body in my own my own
[1063.32 - 1069.14] body and how I feel I and recommend it
[1066.62 - 1071.12] to a family friend or anybody
[1069.14 - 1073.10] that's the second big thing where it's
[1071.12 - 1075.08] like oh my God that's incredible that
[1073.10 - 1076.70] that's not going to be in here which is
[1075.08 - 1078.98] unbelievable now here's the third third
[1076.70 - 1080.00] incredible thing right very cheap
[1078.98 - 1083.30] products
[1080.00 - 1085.58] okay our third party independently
[1083.30 - 1087.14] tested not just
[1085.58 - 1090.92] in-house
[1087.14 - 1092.96] third party independently tested that's
[1090.92 - 1095.72] the kind of Integrity that alone is
[1092.96 - 1098.54] insane and here's the fourth right here
[1095.72 - 1100.82] 's the fourth which I find just as big
[1098.54 - 1103.58] as the other ones right here okay about
[1100.82 - 1105.14] the vimergy products
[1103.58 - 1106.70] the fourth is
[1105.14 - 1109.40] if you want to start a supplement
[1106.70 - 1110.36] company you can choose the lower quality
[1109.40 - 1112.46] stuff
[1110.36 - 1114.38] for price point I don't know if you guys
[1112.46 - 1116.96] heard of anything like this but this is
[1114.38 - 1119.60] how it goes you can choose the lower
[1116.96 - 1122.18] quality right you can choose the lower
[1119.60 - 1123.44] quality cilantro product that's at the
[1122.18 - 1125.90] bottom tier
[1123.44 - 1128.54] or you can choose a little higher that's
[1125.90 - 1130.04] this level product mean the quality or
[1128.54 - 1131.72] you can choose a higher level quality
[1130.04 - 1133.34] it's going to cost more but you can
[1131.72 - 1135.92] choose if your supplement company the
[1133.34 - 1138.68] another level but if you're some you can
[1135.92 - 1141.32] even go higher and Bemidji goes
[1138.68 - 1144.20] to the best sources to the highest
[1141.32 - 1146.48] quality sources they can possibly find
[1144.20 - 1150.26] regardless of the cost
[1146.48 - 1151.34] they go to the top tier regardless of
[1150.26 - 1153.38] the cost
[1151.34 - 1155.78] if that doesn't blow my mind I don't
[1153.38 - 1158.00] know what does or what doesn't and you
[1155.78 - 1159.94] be the judge and jury man you be the
[1158.00 - 1162.38] judge and jury on that so anyway
[1159.94 - 1167.18] connecting to
[1162.38 - 1169.70] my body right having that connection my
[1167.18 - 1173.72] Consciousness my soul my spirit my
[1169.70 - 1175.94] physical body I need to know it's pure
[1173.72 - 1179.54] because I could feel it if I put
[1175.94 - 1182.48] something that's not so pure or not pure
[1179.54 - 1184.70] in my body I'll take it right off
[1182.48 - 1186.56] I'll pick it right off
[1184.70 - 1188.42] and that's the thing with me and that's
[1186.56 - 1190.52] how I've always been and people wonder
[1188.42 - 1192.74] why do you stand behind Imaging so much
[1190.52 - 1194.54] why do you always because of that reason
[1192.74 - 1196.58] that's one of the big reasons right
[1194.54 - 1198.02] there outside of all of them right so
[1196.58 - 1200.00] immune system stuff let's go a little
[1198.02 - 1201.82] bit more into that so back to the immune
[1200.00 - 1204.74] system so what I do is I take vitamin C
[1201.82 - 1207.20] closer to bed is what I do right so I
[1204.74 - 1210.68] take a little bit of vitamin C
[1207.20 - 1212.00] okay that's the micro C right there okay
[1210.68 - 1213.92] if you guys just came on here I'm
[1212.00 - 1216.32] talking about how I support Bemidji
[1213.92 - 1219.10] fully endorse them working with them and
[1216.32 - 1221.96] I'm talking about like the wise too
[1219.10 - 1224.00] about what that connection is like why
[1221.96 - 1226.16] why would I
[1224.00 - 1227.30] because when I think about that
[1226.16 - 1230.18] connection spiritually and everything
[1227.30 - 1231.80] about it so when I do the visualization
[1230.18 - 1235.28] technique
[1231.80 - 1236.78] with my white blood cells at night and
[1235.28 - 1239.00] I'm falling asleep and the lights are
[1236.78 - 1240.92] out and I'm seeing
[1239.00 - 1243.14] my white blood cells now if you're
[1240.92 - 1244.88] somebody that has floaters in your eyes
[1243.14 - 1246.80] right you've got floaters you got you
[1244.88 - 1248.24] got spots and when you close your eyes
[1246.80 - 1249.98] or even when they're open and you see
[1248.24 - 1252.14] them right but you close your eyes
[1249.98 - 1254.96] because the doctor friend was telling me
[1252.14 - 1256.64] how he has these white spots that float
[1254.96 - 1258.68] around when he closes his eyes right eye
[1256.64 - 1260.30] floaters right so he was asking me
[1258.68 - 1262.64] questions about that a doctor friend of
[1260.30 - 1264.68] mine and I said if you have those for
[1262.64 - 1266.96] now before you can work on getting
[1264.68 - 1268.52] Rhythm if you have those for now when
[1266.96 - 1269.66] you're going to bed and you shut your
[1268.52 - 1271.16] eyes he goes well that's when I see him
[1269.66 - 1272.42] I go to bed at night I shut my eyes and
[1271.16 - 1274.28] the eye floaters are all swimming around
[1272.42 - 1276.26] I said Envision that they're not eye
[1274.28 - 1277.76] floaters Envision that they're your
[1276.26 - 1279.68] white blood cells
[1277.76 - 1282.26] that's your that's your white blood
[1279.68 - 1284.36] cells Envision that see those little
[1282.26 - 1286.10] floaters as your white blood cells
[1284.36 - 1287.90] that's them right there your immune
[1286.10 - 1289.94] cells all floating around since that's
[1287.90 - 1292.04] incredible he said that's incredible and
[1289.94 - 1294.44] he's doing it he's doing he says it's a
[1292.04 - 1297.38] life changer game changer for him right
[1294.44 - 1299.30] so I love this technique of seeing the
[1297.38 - 1301.52] white blood cell and then I think about
[1299.30 - 1305.12] the vitamin C
[1301.52 - 1309.38] vitamin C supports a healthy immune
[1305.12 - 1312.80] system vitamin C right it's hot it's
[1309.38 - 1314.78] high in antioxidants right vitamin C
[1312.80 - 1318.86] okay
[1314.78 - 1320.78] right supports the skin it supports the
[1318.86 - 1321.56] skin so you have to think about that
[1320.78 - 1324.50] right
[1321.56 - 1327.56] so if micro C is supporting the skin
[1324.50 - 1329.12] it's supporting right your immune your
[1327.56 - 1330.38] immune system healthy immune system
[1329.12 - 1331.88] supports healthy immune system when
[1330.38 - 1334.28] you're thinking about you're thinking of
[1331.88 - 1337.16] white blood cell the white count
[1334.28 - 1338.66] in that Vision spiritually when you're
[1337.16 - 1341.44] falling asleep
[1338.66 - 1344.50] and I fall asleep to my immune cells
[1341.44 - 1347.42] receiving that vitamin C
[1344.50 - 1350.84] gaining strength in my mind
[1347.42 - 1353.42] Consciousness in my visual and
[1350.84 - 1356.00] affirmation abilities just like you have
[1353.42 - 1358.04] those and I see it gobbling up that
[1356.00 - 1361.40] vitamin C and then I see those white
[1358.04 - 1364.34] blood cells gobbling up anything that I
[1361.40 - 1365.60] want them to gobble up anything that I'm
[1364.34 - 1367.28] thinking about well I had a little
[1365.60 - 1369.02] exposure got into some different toxins
[1367.28 - 1371.66] then I'm seeing my white blood cells go
[1369.02 - 1374.42] and grab those toxins and Gobble those
[1371.66 - 1375.20] toxins up and that's what I do right
[1374.42 - 1377.90] there
[1375.20 - 1381.02] and that's a really big one for me of
[1377.90 - 1383.18] what I do every day okay so
[1381.02 - 1386.30] um I I there's so many reasons why I
[1383.18 - 1388.90] love Energy Products just hear me out if
[1386.30 - 1392.12] you have a second about this beverage
[1388.90 - 1393.50] never uses tablets you know you guys
[1392.12 - 1394.82] know tablets
[1393.50 - 1398.24] tablets
[1394.82 - 1399.56] tablets right because tablets have
[1398.24 - 1403.76] glazes
[1399.56 - 1405.74] fillers titanium dioxide colors Bemidji
[1403.76 - 1407.36] uses capsules if they're not just using
[1405.74 - 1410.06] liquids pure liquids you're using
[1407.36 - 1413.60] capsules to get away from the tablet
[1410.06 - 1415.94] that's how advanced they are it's almost
[1413.60 - 1419.36] like whoa how can you how far can you go
[1415.94 - 1422.06] really you know so anyway with vitamin C
[1419.36 - 1424.52] which is really cool right there's
[1422.06 - 1426.98] there's vitamin C out there but there's
[1424.52 - 1429.20] ascorbic acid now personally in my
[1426.98 - 1431.36] opinion from what I've seen people go
[1429.20 - 1433.64] through with vitamin C and ascorbic acid
[1431.36 - 1435.74] I've seen it bother people's stomachs
[1433.64 - 1437.60] that's what I've seen I've talked to a
[1435.74 - 1440.18] lot of doctors over the years and I've
[1437.60 - 1443.66] had doctors tell me that their patients
[1440.18 - 1447.44] stomachs were being bothered by ascorbic
[1443.66 - 1450.14] acid vitamin C right and vimergy doesn't
[1447.44 - 1452.24] use all that straight ascorbic acid so
[1450.14 - 1453.92] that's really just awesome all in its
[1452.24 - 1455.60] own so
[1453.92 - 1457.58] I give you a quick rundown a couple
[1455.60 - 1460.16] other things I have right here all right
[1457.58 - 1462.50] so uh let me get some
[1460.16 - 1464.56] get a little water in here
[1462.50 - 1466.70] I'm gonna take some other things too
[1464.56 - 1468.68] right first of all I'm going to take a
[1466.70 - 1471.08] couple of capsules right here
[1468.68 - 1473.18] uh micro C
[1471.08 - 1476.72] m
[1473.18 - 1479.12] set those down okay
[1476.72 - 1481.52] and then um
[1479.12 - 1483.50] so the whole thing with like the
[1481.52 - 1485.18] spiritual connection matters to me so I
[1483.50 - 1487.16] think about that with everything I take
[1485.18 - 1489.80] so then when I take
[1487.16 - 1492.68] some curcumin right
[1489.80 - 1497.90] I think about the same thing I connect
[1492.68 - 1500.18] to the turmeric rhizome right the root I
[1497.90 - 1504.56] connect to it right there that's what I
[1500.18 - 1509.12] do I like to I like to visualize
[1504.56 - 1512.24] okay that I'm actually sending a message
[1509.12 - 1515.30] to the farm where it came out of I like
[1512.24 - 1516.68] to connect to the Earth it came out of I
[1515.30 - 1519.98] like to make that spiritual connection
[1516.68 - 1522.32] that Soul connection to that Purity
[1519.98 - 1524.72] right the one thing right here
[1522.32 - 1527.30] which is amazing about the curcumin
[1524.72 - 1529.16] which I like when I take it right is
[1527.30 - 1530.84] there's no black pepper in there because
[1529.16 - 1532.70] in my opinion black pepper is an
[1530.84 - 1534.02] irritant because you see people they're
[1532.70 - 1536.90] like well there's black pepper in my
[1534.02 - 1538.46] curcue bin right and but meanwhile you
[1536.90 - 1540.44] know I got all kinds of problems my
[1538.46 - 1541.82] digestive out there you'll hear that out
[1540.44 - 1543.32] there I've seen it before I've had
[1541.82 - 1544.82] doctor friends tell me this patients
[1543.32 - 1546.32] have all kinds of Crohn's colitis and
[1544.82 - 1548.12] all these different conditions they're
[1546.32 - 1550.10] patients right and the doctor would be
[1548.12 - 1551.66] telling me like they're on a curcumin
[1550.10 - 1553.46] everything like that that'd be like as a
[1551.66 - 1554.72] black pepper in that one like yeah they
[1553.46 - 1556.82] said there's lots of black pepper in
[1554.72 - 1559.40] there it's like you know in my opinion
[1556.82 - 1562.10] you know tell a doctor friend that my
[1559.40 - 1564.02] opinion for sure taking not having a
[1562.10 - 1566.12] black pepper is good because it's an
[1564.02 - 1567.56] irritant right and Verma G doesn't do
[1566.12 - 1569.14] the whole black pepper thing which is
[1567.56 - 1571.70] really cool right
[1569.14 - 1573.50] curcumin turmeric
[1571.70 - 1575.72] and that's there's a combination of both
[1573.50 - 1577.88] in here the whole turmeric and also the
[1575.72 - 1579.56] curcumin in this one great for the
[1577.88 - 1581.00] immune system to support the immune
[1579.56 - 1584.42] system so take one of these down
[1581.00 - 1585.62] nighttime routine mm-hmm
[1584.42 - 1589.46] okay
[1585.62 - 1591.98] now I take Goldenseal
[1589.46 - 1593.54] all the time right so I take it every
[1591.98 - 1596.06] single night for my nighttime routine
[1593.54 - 1598.76] golden seal speaks for itself it always
[1596.06 - 1600.38] has it just speaks for itself right
[1598.76 - 1602.54] there right
[1600.38 - 1604.52] and of course you know the vibration the
[1602.54 - 1608.30] frequency and that's another thing right
[1604.52 - 1611.24] I can hold supplements
[1608.30 - 1613.28] hold them in my hands you know
[1611.24 - 1616.94] and I can feel the frequency and the
[1613.28 - 1619.28] vibration within the supplementation and
[1616.94 - 1621.26] and you you may have that too you may
[1619.28 - 1624.98] have that ability too you may have that
[1621.26 - 1627.80] same ability right to actually be able
[1624.98 - 1630.74] to feel that vibration
[1627.80 - 1632.42] to feel that energetic connection so
[1630.74 - 1634.76] that's what I do with my supplements
[1632.42 - 1637.28] I've had people hand me supplementation
[1634.76 - 1639.26] right in my hand and be like this and
[1637.28 - 1641.72] like no no it's great it's great I would
[1639.26 - 1645.56] hold it and instantly going right up my
[1641.72 - 1647.66] arm boom into my into my body into my
[1645.56 - 1649.76] system right up to my neurons I can feel
[1647.66 - 1653.00] the vibration the frequency I can
[1649.76 - 1656.30] connect to that spiritual nature to that
[1653.00 - 1658.58] product and I can be like no no way give
[1656.30 - 1661.64] me another one to try oh I could feel it
[1658.58 - 1663.80] and feel that that sensation the
[1661.64 - 1665.36] difference between the spiritual nature
[1663.80 - 1667.40] the difference between the purification
[1665.36 - 1669.56] the energy and the frequency I can feel
[1667.40 - 1671.48] it right and that's what I can do and
[1669.56 - 1673.28] that's the difference like pure cilantro
[1671.48 - 1677.06] right
[1673.28 - 1679.34] I can feel it in the cilantro okay
[1677.06 - 1681.68] and that's that's you know just like
[1679.34 - 1685.04] that I can feel it in here and it should
[1681.68 - 1687.86] feel the same way as pure and the
[1685.04 - 1690.92] frequency to that plant I should feel
[1687.86 - 1692.36] the same way when I hold
[1690.92 - 1695.66] right there
[1692.36 - 1697.94] right when I hold that or I hold the
[1695.66 - 1699.80] propolis which is an insane frequency
[1697.94 - 1701.48] for me right there so that's another one
[1699.80 - 1703.52] right there I want to talk about that
[1701.48 - 1706.22] for a second right
[1703.52 - 1708.20] I should feel the same frequency
[1706.22 - 1709.76] when you're feeling that living plant
[1708.20 - 1712.64] right out of your garden when you're
[1709.76 - 1715.10] feeling that live plant these are the
[1712.64 - 1717.68] things I think about on my my like
[1715.10 - 1719.72] moment at night that five minutes I get
[1717.68 - 1721.88] that eight minutes I get at night before
[1719.72 - 1724.58] bed these are the things I have to think
[1721.88 - 1727.52] about all the time right it's that kind
[1724.58 - 1728.84] of thing for my own life and so now I
[1727.52 - 1730.16] want to just talk to you guys about my
[1728.84 - 1732.44] nighttime routine but I want to tell you
[1730.16 - 1734.72] it's not just about what I take it's
[1732.44 - 1737.78] about everything that goes into it and
[1734.72 - 1740.42] everything that goes about it like the
[1737.78 - 1743.12] propolis the connection to the quality
[1740.42 - 1745.58] of that propolis
[1743.12 - 1746.48] which is incredible the quality that
[1745.58 - 1748.94] they have like you can check
[1746.48 - 1750.98] themergy.com and you check it out and
[1748.94 - 1752.90] you can talk to them you'll hear they'll
[1750.98 - 1755.12] tell you about how what's really going
[1752.90 - 1757.40] on with this propolis right anyway I
[1755.12 - 1760.52] could feel that I know that frequency
[1757.40 - 1762.86] that vibration and that connection and
[1760.52 - 1764.06] it's the same thing as like the gold
[1762.86 - 1767.12] seal but I'm going to take some gold and
[1764.06 - 1768.32] seal now because I take gold and seal
[1767.12 - 1770.30] um
[1768.32 - 1772.76] and here's the thing with Goldenseal
[1770.30 - 1774.86] you'll know it when you taste it too
[1772.76 - 1776.30] when it enters your body if you're
[1774.86 - 1779.60] spiritually connected if you're
[1776.30 - 1782.06] connected even if look even if maybe
[1779.60 - 1783.44] your connection is buried
[1782.06 - 1787.52] right
[1783.44 - 1788.78] maybe it's buried but other things in
[1787.52 - 1790.16] your life but it's still there
[1788.78 - 1792.74] Underneath It All
[1790.16 - 1795.92] that frequency that connection that
[1792.74 - 1797.48] vibration your spiritual connection your
[1795.92 - 1798.98] Consciousness right connecting to your
[1797.48 - 1802.04] subconsciousness connection to your soul
[1798.98 - 1803.72] right all of that could be suppressed
[1802.04 - 1805.64] you could be somebody where it's
[1803.72 - 1808.16] suppressed
[1805.64 - 1810.74] but you still have it in you
[1808.16 - 1813.92] but it's hard to use it
[1810.74 - 1816.50] when you have products that aren't pure
[1813.92 - 1819.08] right so when you're using products that
[1816.50 - 1820.82] aren't pure it's hard to decipher and
[1819.08 - 1823.22] weed through and navigate through those
[1820.82 - 1825.26] products so if you have this vibration
[1823.22 - 1827.72] the spiritual connection this energetic
[1825.26 - 1830.12] connection you have the intuitive power
[1827.72 - 1831.50] inside of you but it's suppressed and
[1830.12 - 1833.78] it's buried
[1831.50 - 1835.04] and you're then with some junky products
[1833.78 - 1836.36] or some products that are low quality
[1835.04 - 1838.10] and all this that have natural flavors
[1836.36 - 1840.56] and all this other stuff in it right
[1838.10 - 1842.84] you may not be able to fish through that
[1840.56 - 1846.02] to navigate through that yet in your
[1842.84 - 1847.40] life because it's suppressed right or
[1846.02 - 1848.84] you may be somebody where it's not
[1847.40 - 1851.78] suppressed and you have that that
[1848.84 - 1853.70] intuition spot on not just intuition but
[1851.78 - 1855.38] your frequency your vibration everything
[1853.70 - 1857.78] is just on you're spiritually connected
[1855.38 - 1859.76] all of it's on right so then you know
[1857.78 - 1861.62] and that's when you know when you have
[1859.76 - 1864.38] also a good goal until that's how I do
[1861.62 - 1869.24] it too it's like okay well then yeah
[1864.38 - 1871.88] um and you can feel it go down right
[1869.24 - 1874.88] same thing with propolis right
[1871.88 - 1876.44] I've tried every propolis almost every
[1874.88 - 1877.88] single propolis I could ever get my
[1876.44 - 1881.48] hands on out there because I've always
[1877.88 - 1883.34] been a propolis fiend because of soc
[1881.48 - 1884.30] telling me propolis is so important
[1883.34 - 1887.30] right
[1884.30 - 1888.20] and so good so I've tried so many and so
[1887.30 - 1890.60] many
[1888.20 - 1892.52] that say they're alcohol free but still
[1890.60 - 1894.08] have propylene glycol in it it's so
[1892.52 - 1897.44] confusing like the whole thing is
[1894.08 - 1899.84] confusing and that's a thing like that's
[1897.44 - 1901.40] what you you don't have to disclose the
[1899.84 - 1903.38] tiniest bit of stuff that's out there
[1901.40 - 1905.48] for so many reasons for so many people
[1903.38 - 1909.02] out there but the point is is that this
[1905.48 - 1911.00] right here I mean you know when you
[1909.02 - 1913.22] actually use it the difference if you've
[1911.00 - 1915.02] used other propolises you know the
[1913.22 - 1917.60] difference right you know the difference
[1915.02 - 1919.22] it's like when when you get when you get
[1917.60 - 1921.56] that hit
[1919.22 - 1922.46] and you taste it and the thing is is
[1921.56 - 1925.58] this
[1922.46 - 1928.16] that I connect to that that's my
[1925.58 - 1930.14] nighttime routine it's knowing all these
[1928.16 - 1932.24] things right and connecting to it which
[1930.14 - 1934.04] is really really it's fun too in the
[1932.24 - 1936.62] sense because you it's something that
[1934.04 - 1939.02] it's just it feels so good
[1936.62 - 1941.84] a licorice
[1939.02 - 1945.50] so I've been taking licorice forever
[1941.84 - 1948.02] it's just one of those herbs right that
[1945.50 - 1950.84] I've been taking forever so I just I'm
[1948.02 - 1951.74] I've Loved licorice from when I was a
[1950.84 - 1953.54] child
[1951.74 - 1956.00] I take it it's part of my nighttime
[1953.54 - 1958.76] routine because I've been taking it my
[1956.00 - 1960.74] whole life and I just love it and I've
[1958.76 - 1963.02] had to deal with low quality licorice's
[1960.74 - 1965.48] when I was younger I had to deal with
[1963.02 - 1967.64] low quality licorice products I had to
[1965.48 - 1969.20] deal with licorice types of candy that
[1967.64 - 1971.24] weren't the fake candy but the real
[1969.20 - 1973.34] licorice candy right I've had to deal
[1971.24 - 1974.96] with those I've had to deal with all the
[1973.34 - 1976.28] different forms of licorice licorice
[1974.96 - 1979.34] powders
[1976.28 - 1981.98] where I've had some bad licorice powders
[1979.34 - 1984.08] out there throughout the years 20 30
[1981.98 - 1985.28] years ago trying different licorice's
[1984.08 - 1987.14] I've had licorice where there was
[1985.28 - 1990.20] alcohol in it lots of alcohol in the
[1987.14 - 1993.08] licorice all these things and I waited
[1990.20 - 1996.32] like a lifetime for a company to step it
[1993.08 - 1999.62] up to actually step it up into gear
[1996.32 - 2002.50] and make a licorice that I can feel good
[1999.62 - 2005.26] about taking for myself and recommend a
[2002.50 - 2006.64] friend a loved one anybody and
[2005.26 - 2007.96] especially someone with chronic illness
[2006.64 - 2009.88] right out there in the world knowing
[2007.96 - 2012.28] that when they go to their doctor they
[2009.88 - 2013.84] say hey to their doctor hey Dr MD can I
[2012.28 - 2015.22] take this licorice knowing that the
[2013.84 - 2016.84] doctor might be like whoa that stuff
[2015.22 - 2019.66] looks good but
[2016.84 - 2023.14] the point is my whole life I've been
[2019.66 - 2025.90] waiting for like a licorice that stood
[2023.14 - 2028.72] apart that stands apart
[2025.90 - 2029.98] and no no junk in it of all these
[2028.72 - 2032.20] different kinds of things like you know
[2029.98 - 2034.78] the whole bit and that's the key right
[2032.20 - 2035.92] there like high quality so I take
[2034.78 - 2038.08] licorice
[2035.92 - 2040.78] myself I've been taking it my whole life
[2038.08 - 2042.94] I love the taste of Licorice and when
[2040.78 - 2045.64] you get a licorice
[2042.94 - 2048.10] right that is pure
[2045.64 - 2050.50] you can taste it so I love connection
[2048.10 - 2052.36] like that connection connecting to that
[2050.50 - 2055.12] taste right that vibration that
[2052.36 - 2058.00] frequency because of herbs
[2055.12 - 2060.46] right the whole herbal thing
[2058.00 - 2063.58] the frequency the vibration of herbs
[2060.46 - 2066.22] everything about it it's grown for
[2063.58 - 2069.88] humankind right all of that
[2066.22 - 2071.56] I connect to and I think about right
[2069.88 - 2073.06] so anyway
[2071.56 - 2074.16] hmm
[2073.06 - 2077.32] cheers

[2077.32 - 2080.92] licorice right
[2079.06 - 2082.78] and I've known people who hate the
[2080.92 - 2085.18] flavor of licorice
[2082.78 - 2086.14] and then I say well try the Bemidji one
[2085.18 - 2088.18] and see what you think they try
[2086.14 - 2091.12] everything like why how come I like the

[2156.34 - 2161.68] stimulants
[2157.54 - 2163.48] so I don't choose stimulants right now
[2161.68 - 2166.12] I'm going to tell you right now Heart to
[2163.48 - 2167.92] Heart right now a heart to heart I do
[2166.12 - 2170.74] not blame you if you have to use a
[2167.92 - 2173.62] stimulant I do not judge you I do not
[2170.74 - 2175.00] blame you if you have to use coffee if
[2173.62 - 2177.22] you have to use matcha tea if you have
[2175.00 - 2178.66] if you have to use right Kombucha Tea if

[2180.64 - 2185.62] you're doing if you have to survive by
[2183.70 - 2188.08] actually doing stimulants
[2185.62 - 2189.82] by having to do all the caffeine stuff
[2188.08 - 2191.98] and the chocolate stuff I am not going
[2189.82 - 2193.66] to say one word I am not going to
[2191.98 - 2195.40] denounce it I'm not going to say look

[2197.20 - 2201.04] because guess what
[2198.58 - 2203.74] there's a reason why you're using
[2201.04 - 2205.24] stimulants there's a reason why and it's
[2203.74 - 2207.94] not your fault
[2205.24 - 2209.74] it's not your fault you're not the
[2207.94 - 2211.54] reason why you're a mommy that might be
[2209.74 - 2213.22] on all this caffeine while breastfeeding
[2211.54 - 2215.20] or you're you're somebody that's on all
[2213.22 - 2216.76] this caffeine or you're a runner and you
[2215.20 - 2218.32] know you're an actual Runner out there
[2216.76 - 2219.82] and you run races and you do all these
[2218.32 - 2221.08] things and you're jacked up on all these
[2219.82 - 2222.52] energy drinks and caffeine and
[2221.08 - 2224.38] everything else that has done I'm not
[2222.52 - 2227.02] saying any of that's bad bad I'm just
[2224.38 - 2229.84] saying that I choose not to do it
[2227.02 - 2230.92] I choose to stay off of all the
[2229.84 - 2232.60] stimulants
[2230.92 - 2236.14] that's what I do in my personal life
[2232.60 - 2240.28] that's how I am so stimulant free but
[2236.14 - 2244.66] then I want to rely on Nature's real
[2240.28 - 2247.84] natural natural right energetic the
[2244.66 - 2250.66] vibration of nature things that are that
[2247.84 - 2252.90] are important for our bodies and our
[2250.66 - 2256.36] bodies needs right the more our body
[2252.90 - 2258.60] utilizes things right and so you know I
[2256.36 - 2260.98] like a pure B12 like this is the
[2258.60 - 2263.70] adenosilcobalamin methylcobalamin the
[2260.98 - 2263.70] right balance
[2263.88 - 2269.98] right so that's the one right there
[2267.52 - 2271.60] so anyway you guys
[2269.98 - 2272.74] just run through some of these things
[2271.60 - 2274.84] right there
[2272.74 - 2276.22] but I don't do caffeine and if you're
[2274.84 - 2279.10] doing caffeine I don't judge you because
[2276.22 - 2281.14] you might be stuck doing the caffeine
[2279.10 - 2284.02] because you're trying to survive that's
[2281.14 - 2286.30] what I mean I don't judge you I don't
[2284.02 - 2288.10] right because I know that you might be
[2286.30 - 2289.60] tired you might be fatigued you might be
[2288.10 - 2291.16] having problems you might be like
[2289.60 - 2292.60] energetically down you might be
[2291.16 - 2294.64] struggling you might have stress you
[2292.60 - 2296.32] might have losses you might have all
[2294.64 - 2298.54] these different things and in the
[2296.32 - 2300.16] caffeine is pushing you through and I
[2298.54 - 2302.56] will never ever
[2300.16 - 2304.96] ever doubt you
[2302.56 - 2306.58] for who you are and why you have to use
[2304.96 - 2307.66] a stimulant to survive and push through
[2306.58 - 2309.70] you don't think I don't have friends
[2307.66 - 2311.32] that have really hard situations where
[2309.70 - 2313.96] they've had to start the stimulants all
[2311.32 - 2315.46] the way from childhood you know so yeah
[2313.96 - 2317.62] I totally get it
[2315.46 - 2319.72] I'm all about of course getting you know
[2317.62 - 2321.16] getting healthier healthier strong
[2319.72 - 2323.20] strengths you don't need stimulants but
[2321.16 - 2326.16] whatever that's another talk on another
[2323.20 - 2330.30] day anyway what I love about the B12 is
[2326.16 - 2332.80] no natural flavors
[2330.30 - 2335.62] no flavors
[2332.80 - 2337.36] in there if you guys just got on here
[2335.62 - 2338.80] talking about why I support them regime
[2337.36 - 2340.48] talking about my nighttime routine if
[2338.80 - 2342.10] you just got on now I fully endorse
[2340.48 - 2345.10] Bemidji because it's about high time
[2342.10 - 2347.50] because I want them to be out there I
[2345.10 - 2349.42] need people to know there are
[2347.50 - 2351.04] opportunities where there is really
[2349.42 - 2353.44] incredible stuff out there and I don't
[2351.04 - 2356.08] want that to disappear someday you know
[2353.44 - 2358.96] I want to give my full support and
[2356.08 - 2360.58] pledge my full support to a company
[2358.96 - 2362.80] that's actually doing things that I
[2360.58 - 2364.18] haven't seen anybody do out there the
[2362.80 - 2365.80] four incredible things I talked about
[2364.18 - 2367.54] earlier so if you just got here now
[2365.80 - 2370.30] watch us from the beginning and you'll
[2367.54 - 2372.76] hear the four incredible things where it
[2370.30 - 2374.98] is mind-blowing to what the company does
[2372.76 - 2377.32] and the difference and how it works and
[2374.98 - 2379.18] when you hear those you be the judge and
[2377.32 - 2381.52] I'm telling you right now it's like it's
[2379.18 - 2383.74] it's mind-blowing really okay so I just
[2381.52 - 2386.38] want to say that right a little later
[2383.74 - 2388.90] after dinner I'll show you how I take my
[2386.38 - 2391.42] wind down supplements if you guys just
[2388.90 - 2392.86] got here after dinner which I'm gonna
[2391.42 - 2396.46] make some food I'm going to talk about
[2392.86 - 2399.58] my winding down supplementation which
[2396.46 - 2402.64] I'm going to show you I take and what I
[2399.58 - 2405.22] visualize and what I see and all of it
[2402.64 - 2406.96] so I'm excited about that right there so
[2405.22 - 2408.52] and the thing is I didn't even talk
[2406.96 - 2409.78] about these wind down supplements but
[2408.52 - 2411.70] we'll talk about them in a little bit
[2409.78 - 2415.18] and I'm excited about that so I'm going
[2411.70 - 2417.94] to make some noise right here
[2415.18 - 2421.30] so I like Nori's at night because it's
[2417.94 - 2423.82] light I don't want a lump of lead I
[2421.30 - 2426.64] don't want a big hunk of bacon or a pork
[2423.82 - 2428.86] chop in my gullet what I'm trying to
[2426.64 - 2430.78] fall asleep you know what I mean like I
[2428.86 - 2432.64] don't want that happening you know I
[2430.78 - 2433.84] mean let's look if you if you want to do
[2432.64 - 2436.06] that if you want to have pork chops
[2433.84 - 2438.52] before bed I'm just totally right I get
[2436.06 - 2441.88] it 100 that's fine but I like something
[2438.52 - 2444.52] lighter and it changes for me too it
[2441.88 - 2447.58] changes this isn't the like only thing I
[2444.52 - 2449.74] have every single night it's not that I
[2447.58 - 2451.48] just have you know it's not that I just
[2449.74 - 2453.58] have this right here where I'm having
[2451.48 - 2456.64] Nori rolls and that's only it and that's
[2453.58 - 2458.44] all so I eat a lot of different things
[2456.64 - 2460.78] you guys have known throughout all the
[2458.44 - 2464.56] time so let me just get a blade out here
[2460.78 - 2466.30] all right so first of all I'm gonna chop
[2464.56 - 2468.94] up a few things let me chop up a pepper
[2466.30 - 2470.98] really quick I love Peppers right I love
[2468.94 - 2473.98] all different kinds of peppers too okay
[2470.98 - 2476.32] so this is a bell pepper right
[2473.98 - 2478.54] so so what I'm doing is I'm cutting some
[2476.32 - 2480.46] slices of bell pepper right here okay so
[2478.54 - 2483.60] I'm going to cut a few slices
[2480.46 - 2483.60] real quick here
[2484.54 - 2487.90] all right
[2486.28 - 2490.00] and then
[2487.90 - 2491.68] I'm going to line this into the Nori
[2490.00 - 2492.46] right here if you can see this right
[2491.68 - 2495.46] there
[2492.46 - 2498.76] okay this is really fresh and this is a
[2495.46 - 2501.22] live and that's another thing too I like
[2498.76 - 2502.30] doing raw dinners not like cooked
[2501.22 - 2504.46] dinners too
[2502.30 - 2506.62] I like cooked dinners okay don't get me
[2504.46 - 2509.02] wrong but I also like raw dinners
[2506.62 - 2510.28] because of the frequency all of it you
[2509.02 - 2513.40] know everything about it here's an
[2510.28 - 2515.44] orange right here I'm gonna moisten that
[2513.40 - 2516.88] I'm gonna moisten this in a second I'm
[2515.44 - 2518.62] just not going to moisten it yet because
[2516.88 - 2521.02] if you moisten it too early what happens
[2518.62 - 2524.02] is all of a sudden it just shrivels up
[2521.02 - 2526.12] it gets all wet it falls apart right
[2524.02 - 2527.62] and so that's important to know right
[2526.12 - 2529.68] there
[2527.62 - 2529.68] um
[2529.90 - 2534.82] let's go a little bit more on this let's
[2531.58 - 2537.22] do it so let's get some Tomatoes going
[2534.82 - 2540.10] so I got red bell not red but I got
[2537.22 - 2541.42] sorry red cherry tomatoes here I also
[2540.10 - 2544.00] have these other
[2541.42 - 2546.22] larger cherry tomatoes right so I'm
[2544.00 - 2548.92] cutting these up a little bit I'm gonna
[2546.22 - 2551.50] put some nice fresh tomatoes in this
[2548.92 - 2554.32] roll up right there you can make these
[2551.50 - 2556.90] as fat as you want you can make them
[2554.32 - 2558.34] as skinny as you as skinny as you know
[2556.90 - 2560.74] you want with these two like you can
[2558.34 - 2564.24] make these rollers real big you can make
[2560.74 - 2568.90] these roll ups really
[2564.24 - 2573.04] thin you can do either or I love this as
[2568.90 - 2576.22] a nighttime meal because of the fact
[2573.04 - 2579.58] that it's all living right so I like
[2576.22 - 2582.34] knowing that the food is all alive now
[2579.58 - 2584.08] if you know like medical medium recipes
[2582.34 - 2587.68] and everything you know we do lots of
[2584.08 - 2590.56] cooked ones right we do we do um lots of
[2587.68 - 2592.42] raw ones you have the choices you
[2590.56 - 2594.40] they're there for you which is amazing
[2592.42 - 2596.80] that's what's incredible about it it's
[2594.40 - 2600.22] not one size fits all so that's the
[2596.80 - 2602.68] incredible thing about mm info it's not
[2600.22 - 2605.08] one size fits all and I'll give you an
[2602.68 - 2607.66] example this is just one of my nighttime
[2605.08 - 2609.70] routines right here this supplementation
[2607.66 - 2611.44] for what's happening in my life in the
[2609.70 - 2613.24] moment for what I'm going through what
[2611.44 - 2614.98] I'm doing see that's why it's not one
[2613.24 - 2616.24] size fits off it was one size fits all
[2614.98 - 2617.26] then this would be the only thing
[2616.24 - 2620.14] forever
[2617.26 - 2621.88] but it's not it changes could change in
[2620.14 - 2624.16] two weeks it could change in a week it
[2621.88 - 2626.98] can change in like a month but it's
[2624.16 - 2629.98] never one size fits all because we
[2626.98 - 2631.30] change right what's happening around us
[2629.98 - 2633.28] changes
[2631.30 - 2634.78] which is really you know interesting
[2633.28 - 2637.72] right that's just life so I'm putting
[2634.78 - 2639.58] some onion right here okay I sliced it
[2637.72 - 2641.32] kind of thin
[2639.58 - 2643.18] so what I did
[2641.32 - 2644.98] sliced it kind of thin you guys see that
[2643.18 - 2646.54] right there okay
[2644.98 - 2649.18] so we got that
[2646.54 - 2651.64] now let's get a little bit of cilantro
[2649.18 - 2654.40] in here so what I do is you can couple
[2651.64 - 2657.24] of options you can cut the cilantro
[2654.40 - 2657.24] chop it up right
[2660.82 - 2664.36] recommend chopping it up if you want it
[2663.22 - 2666.76] in a roll up
[2664.36 - 2668.68] because the stems
[2666.76 - 2670.12] get a little bit problematic now I'm
[2668.68 - 2672.70] using which what you're seeing right
[2670.12 - 2674.68] here what you're noticing is I'm using
[2672.70 - 2677.20] the cilantro as a leafy green if you
[2674.68 - 2680.56] guys came on here just now I talked
[2677.20 - 2683.14] about some powerful reasons why I use
[2680.56 - 2685.84] the beverage supplements right and and
[2683.14 - 2687.88] I've been and now you know like my God
[2685.84 - 2690.40] the stuff is so incredible for what
[2687.88 - 2693.28] they're doing the connection that I have
[2690.40 - 2695.44] with them spiritually and emotionally
[2693.28 - 2697.72] and the vibrations and the frequencies
[2695.44 - 2699.64] everything I talked about right
[2697.72 - 2701.56] it's amazing and I love to make a
[2699.64 - 2702.76] connection to my food too and that's
[2701.56 - 2704.44] what we're talking about here so I'm
[2702.76 - 2706.42] putting a little onion in here
[2704.44 - 2709.72] right there right
[2706.42 - 2711.94] there we go and well I like to connect
[2709.72 - 2714.70] to the food I'm making so I think about
[2711.94 - 2716.86] the onions I think about the power
[2714.70 - 2719.20] onions have right because onions are
[2716.86 - 2722.08] incredible for the immune system onions
[2719.20 - 2723.94] are an herb and I like to remember that
[2722.08 - 2725.74] see a lot of people forget that onions
[2723.94 - 2727.30] or herbs and they don't make that
[2725.74 - 2729.40] connections it's important to make that
[2727.30 - 2731.62] connection because you're looking at
[2729.40 - 2732.76] herbal medicine with an onion that's
[2731.62 - 2735.22] what you're looking at you're looking at
[2732.76 - 2737.26] herbal medicine with an onion so I like
[2735.22 - 2739.18] having that connection to an onion like
[2737.26 - 2740.38] that right which is important to me so
[2739.18 - 2743.74] I'm going to put a little bit of this
[2740.38 - 2745.36] orange and think about what it took for
[2743.74 - 2747.40] this orange to grow so my nighttime
[2745.36 - 2749.62] routine is about all these things this
[2747.40 - 2752.32] is it right here it's about thinking
[2749.62 - 2754.30] about this orange and then psychically
[2752.32 - 2755.62] trying to connect to where this orange
[2754.30 - 2758.20] came from
[2755.62 - 2762.04] what tree it came off of
[2758.20 - 2763.60] if I sit there in a meditation just for
[2762.04 - 2766.54] one or two minutes
[2763.60 - 2768.10] I can connect to the tree even if I
[2766.54 - 2770.32] don't know where the tree really is but
[2768.10 - 2772.06] I can connect to I can transport that
[2770.32 - 2773.80] connection right that frequency and
[2772.06 - 2775.30] connect to that frequency continuity I
[2773.80 - 2777.94] can make continuity between the orange
[2775.30 - 2781.24] and my hand and to the tree it came from
[2777.94 - 2783.58] and I love to do that at night when I'm
[2781.24 - 2785.26] making you know food when I'm eating the
[2783.58 - 2787.54] food I'm putting a couple of drops on
[2785.26 - 2789.52] here on the sheet
[2787.54 - 2791.38] and I'm gonna be making a dipping sauce
[2789.52 - 2792.34] any second so I'm just going to roll
[2791.38 - 2794.56] this up
[2792.34 - 2797.92] and then I'm gonna make a nice dipping
[2794.56 - 2799.90] sauce now the dipping sauce is hot you
[2797.92 - 2801.88] may not like hot stuff then keep the
[2799.90 - 2804.10] heat out and that's okay so that's a
[2801.88 - 2808.18] Nori roll right there that's a on the
[2804.10 - 2809.92] thinner side okay all right that's on
[2808.18 - 2811.90] the thinner side right there let me just
[2809.92 - 2814.48] give you a little close-up on that Nori
[2811.90 - 2816.22] roll on a nice plate so you can see that
[2814.48 - 2818.86] close-up okay there it is wow it's
[2816.22 - 2820.60] amazing great focus on that I love it so
[2818.86 - 2823.90] that's the Nori roll right there that's
[2820.60 - 2826.24] a thin one it's alive it's fresh it's
[2823.90 - 2828.46] living it's got the orange squeezed
[2826.24 - 2830.08] orange right to moisten it it's ready
[2828.46 - 2832.06] let's make a dipping sauce and then
[2830.08 - 2834.94] we'll make a couple more rolls
[2832.06 - 2836.02] pumped up about it I really am dipping
[2834.94 - 2838.36] sauce
[2836.02 - 2840.58] it's gonna be an orange dipping sauce
[2838.36 - 2843.88] right
[2840.58 - 2844.66] don't throw around glass balls
[2843.88 - 2847.66] yeah
[2844.66 - 2849.94] so you know here it is cut the orange
[2847.66 - 2852.76] squeeze the orange
[2849.94 - 2854.62] right in I mean even
[2852.76 - 2856.84] grab a little bit of a strainer really
[2854.62 - 2858.52] quick squeeze that through so I'm
[2856.84 - 2861.40] catching the seeds to make life easy
[2858.52 - 2864.58] right here while we're live
[2861.40 - 2867.88] while we're live and doing this
[2864.58 - 2869.26] so I'm making this orange juice dipping
[2867.88 - 2872.44] sauce
[2869.26 - 2875.32] which I just absolutely adore because
[2872.44 - 2878.08] I've had it so many times in my life and
[2875.32 - 2881.02] I love it because it's so fresh it's so
[2878.08 - 2884.14] alive and I think about the vitamin C
[2881.02 - 2886.84] that's in that orange juice right
[2884.14 - 2889.18] you know right that Sailors on the ocean
[2886.84 - 2892.48] you heard this I talked about this in
[2889.18 - 2895.84] early podcasts Sailors on the ocean if
[2892.48 - 2897.76] they didn't have a lime or a lemon or an
[2895.84 - 2899.74] orange and they were out there on the
[2897.76 - 2903.94] water too long
[2899.74 - 2907.12] the men would get scurvy right that
[2903.94 - 2910.84] their immune systems would fall apart
[2907.12 - 2914.44] they would just lose their vitality
[2910.84 - 2916.48] right they were they could not exist on
[2914.44 - 2918.94] jerky because that's what they had they
[2916.48 - 2921.58] had jerkies what they had right so it
[2918.94 - 2924.40] was only jerky that's all they had they
[2921.58 - 2926.74] were chewing that jerky and then
[2924.40 - 2928.78] they would lose
[2926.74 - 2933.34] their health
[2928.78 - 2936.28] because they did not have that vitamin C
[2933.34 - 2937.90] which was critical so we're making a
[2936.28 - 2940.42] dipping sauce right
[2937.90 - 2941.86] that's looking good right there
[2940.42 - 2945.10] all right
[2941.86 - 2946.72] so in this dipping sauce I'm gonna put a
[2945.10 - 2949.12] little bit of honey in this dipping
[2946.72 - 2950.98] sauce let's go
[2949.12 - 2953.74] you guys know how I feel about honey
[2950.98 - 2958.36] right another thing I like to connect
[2953.74 - 2960.40] you right there is the honey now I put a
[2958.36 - 2962.86] decent amount in there because I'm
[2960.40 - 2966.12] making this dipping sauce hot that's the
[2962.86 - 2966.12] way I like it right
[2966.34 - 2971.14] and
[2969.04 - 2972.94] that's the way I really like it let me
[2971.14 - 2974.92] mix this up right there to begin with so
[2972.94 - 2976.18] I have the
[2974.92 - 2978.40] um
[2976.18 - 2981.64] I got the honey in here with the orange
[2978.40 - 2983.56] juice let me just mix this up right
[2981.64 - 2986.56] there you go
[2983.56 - 2990.88] get that moving in there
[2986.56 - 2993.76] so this is a sweet and hot sauce
[2990.88 - 2995.62] I love it at night it's got the glucose
[2993.76 - 2998.86] from the orange juice it's got the
[2995.62 - 3000.90] glucose incredible glucose from the raw
[2998.86 - 3002.70] honey which is incredible on its own
[3000.90 - 3003.54] right you're talking about the glucose
[3002.70 - 3006.78] and then you're talking about
[3003.54 - 3008.52] phytochemical compounds in the honey you
[3006.78 - 3010.38] guys probably heard my podcast right the
[3008.52 - 3012.30] raw honey podcast episode
[3010.38 - 3013.80] Right medical meeting podcasts at Apple

[3522.30 - 3527.28] connecting with them they're grown for
[3523.98 - 3529.70] me right they're grown for what my body
[3527.28 - 3532.20] needs because a plant can actually
[3529.70 - 3534.18] detect what your body needs when you're
[3532.20 - 3536.04] growing it yourself so you're sitting
[3534.18 - 3538.14] here you're watering it
[3536.04 - 3539.28] you grab a couple of caterpillars off
[3538.14 - 3541.86] the plant
[3539.28 - 3544.14] you you pluck a couple of leaves that
[3541.86 - 3546.00] are kind of like a little dried up and
[3544.14 - 3547.80] you just you nurture that plant you take
[3546.00 - 3549.96] care of that plant and that plant knows
[3547.80 - 3551.64] you it knows you it knows you're going
[3549.96 - 3553.26] to consume the food it knows you're in
[3551.64 - 3555.84] touch with it it knows who you are
[3553.26 - 3558.06] plants know who we are when we're
[3555.84 - 3559.98] nurturing that plant that plant's
[3558.06 - 3562.68] receiving that nurturing it's receiving
[3559.98 - 3564.24] that information
[3562.68 - 3565.74] it's receiving that vibration that
[3564.24 - 3567.00] frequency it's receiving all that and
[3565.74 - 3568.50] then we're connecting that's how it
[3567.00 - 3572.28] works I'm gonna have one more of these
[3568.50 - 3575.66] and I'm gonna do my time T real quick
[3572.28 - 3575.66] remember one more if you guys
[3576.84 - 3581.66] come on
[3578.70 - 3581.66] what's insane
[3583.68 - 3586.98] hmm
[3584.82 - 3589.92] I usually go back to work after there
[3586.98 - 3591.36] but since I'm not working
[3589.92 - 3593.22] since I'm not working tonight I'm just
[3591.36 - 3595.32] talking to you guys which is really fun
[3593.22 - 3597.12] I'm going to show you my sleeping
[3595.32 - 3599.16] routine really quick but let's just make
[3597.12 - 3601.26] some time tea really quick got a cup
[3599.16 - 3603.84] right here boom
[3601.26 - 3607.44] need some time got some time right here
[3603.84 - 3609.30] time that came out of my garden right
[3607.44 - 3611.58] I'm going to put this time right in that
[3609.30 - 3613.38] cup that's how I'm going to do it
[3611.58 - 3614.88] okay
[3613.38 - 3617.64] now you can do a couple different things
[3614.88 - 3619.20] if you want honey in here
[3617.64 - 3620.64] I can put a little honey in here if you
[3619.20 - 3622.26] want honey in your time tea take the
[3620.64 - 3624.96] time out first right
[3622.26 - 3626.46] put the honey in
[3624.96 - 3628.14] okay
[3626.46 - 3631.02] nice
[3628.14 - 3633.48] I think someone said way too much honey
[3631.02 - 3637.40] someone just complained
[3633.48 - 3637.40] instead I used way too much honey
[3638.12 - 3643.20] SOC just told me somebody's freaking out
[3640.92 - 3646.02] about how much honey I just used
[3643.20 - 3647.00] well I'm sorry I hope I didn't offend
[3646.02 - 3649.44] you
[3647.00 - 3651.54] listen to my last one of my last
[3649.44 - 3652.86] podcasts that I just did like the raw
[3651.54 - 3654.72] honey podcast
[3652.86 - 3656.46] check it out when you can listen to it
[3654.72 - 3657.54] and and recommended podcast at Apple
[3656.46 - 3659.16] podcast check it out when you get a
[3657.54 - 3661.44] chance anyway I put the honey in here
[3659.16 - 3663.96] let's get the hot water in
[3661.44 - 3665.82] nice
[3663.96 - 3667.98] I know someone's upset about how much
[3665.82 - 3669.12] honey I put in I'm not trying to get you
[3667.98 - 3671.10] upset
[3669.12 - 3672.90] I want you happy
[3671.10 - 3674.58] and I just want to put a little bit more
[3672.90 - 3678.50] honey in there not to make you upset
[3674.58 - 3678.50] don't get upset stop getting upset
[3678.80 - 3685.38] I'm going to mix that honey up in that
[3682.56 - 3688.26] because that's glucose right there for
[3685.38 - 3691.14] my brain If you hear the Honey episode
[3688.26 - 3693.84] you'll know what I'm talking about right
[3691.14 - 3696.72] I don't run on caffeine I don't run on
[3693.84 - 3699.12] stimulants I run on glucose because my
[3696.72 - 3700.92] neurons need the glucose they need it
[3699.12 - 3703.80] because they're firing like crazy
[3700.92 - 3707.22] because of all the because of all the
[3703.80 - 3711.24] information I have to receive from SOC I
[3707.22 - 3713.04] have a very unfun job of receiving that
[3711.24 - 3715.74] information and then trying to put that
[3713.04 - 3718.62] information into words as a messenger
[3715.74 - 3720.48] for everybody else I got some incredible
[3718.62 - 3722.70] time tea going right there take a look
[3720.48 - 3723.84] close like that and you can take a look
[3722.70 - 3728.24] this way too
[3723.84 - 3728.24] right here I'm gonna sip it
[3728.52 - 3732.48] oh my God so delicious too so let's talk
[3730.44 - 3734.10] about the winding down part of my
[3732.48 - 3736.20] routine my nighttime routine where I'm
[3734.10 - 3737.94] winding down because God knows I need to
[3736.20 - 3739.44] kind of that winding down moment because
[3737.94 - 3741.90] so much is going on so much information
[3739.44 - 3743.88] is going on so I start with lemon balm
[3741.90 - 3747.00] right there so make sure I get my lemon
[3743.88 - 3749.04] balm in me okay it's a commentative
[3747.00 - 3750.72] that's what I love about it right and
[3749.04 - 3752.82] when it's high quality in my opinion man
[3750.72 - 3754.86] when it's pure like this there's a whole
[3752.82 - 3757.08] different frequency so it's a
[3754.86 - 3759.84] commentative right it's for the nerves
[3757.08 - 3761.72] for stress relaxation so I like to send
[3759.84 - 3764.58] that down
[3761.72 - 3767.22] boom that's down right there okay so
[3764.58 - 3768.96] let's get some Gaba going
[3767.22 - 3772.34] how about that
[3768.96 - 3772.34] a little bit of Gaba going
[3772.74 - 3776.52] right
[3774.60 - 3782.24] so here we are
[3776.52 - 3785.34] Gaba counters excess brain stimulation
[3782.24 - 3787.74] so think about that I mean in your life
[3785.34 - 3788.82] how much excess brain stimulation do you
[3787.74 - 3790.08] have
[3788.82 - 3792.36] you know ask your doctor what's right
[3790.08 - 3795.72] for you whatever but I have a lot of
[3792.36 - 3797.28] excess brain stimulation too much from
[3795.72 - 3799.68] everything that's going on from hearing
[3797.28 - 3801.24] SOC from living my life having all the
[3799.68 - 3803.76] responsibilities from doing all the work
[3801.24 - 3805.50] right so a lot of stimulation right
[3803.76 - 3807.26] there
[3805.50 - 3810.00] hmm
[3807.26 - 3812.34] send that Gaba down right there next
[3810.00 - 3815.04] magnesium
[3812.34 - 3817.50] right helps with muscles that's the
[3815.04 - 3819.60] whole thing too magnesium helps with
[3817.50 - 3822.42] muscles
[3819.60 - 3826.52] okay I love it for the nervous system
[3822.42 - 3826.52] too it's another thing too all right
[3827.58 - 3834.72] magnesium Down the Hatch and then
[3831.36 - 3836.28] right before I go to bed this is how I
[3834.72 - 3837.84] do it okay you ask your doctor what's
[3836.28 - 3841.74] right for you and all that but how I do
[3837.84 - 3845.48] it is I take my melatonin right before I
[3841.74 - 3845.48] turn off the light and go to bed
[3849.72 - 3852.38] foreign
