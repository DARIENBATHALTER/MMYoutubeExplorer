[0.00 - 6.48] So today we're talking about how viruses
[3.36 - 9.18] are alive and how they eat
[6.48 - 12.60] so one thing to really understand out
[9.18 - 15.30] there is that no one realizes out there
[12.60 - 17.22] in the medical health world and medical
[15.30 - 19.86] research and science the viruses
[17.22 - 21.78] actually are alive and they actually eat
[19.86 - 23.76] they contradict themselves out there too
[21.78 - 25.62] big part of the medical industry is like
[23.76 - 27.84] no viruses are dead they're dead
[25.62 - 29.64] Alternative Health industry viruses are
[27.84 - 31.50] dead viruses aren't even alive they're
[29.64 - 34.08] just a strand of itself there's just a
[31.50 - 36.06] DNA strand of itself and then there's
[34.08 - 38.52] also but what about the flu what about
[36.06 - 40.62] the flu the flu is probably alive right
[38.52 - 41.76] and so there's confusion in that Arena
[40.62 - 43.44] we're going to kind of talk up a little
[41.76 - 46.32] bit about that but we're going to cover
[43.44 - 48.12] how viruses are hungry
[46.32 - 51.84] viruses eat
[48.12 - 54.60] and viruses are alive important to know
[51.84 - 58.20] so anyway got an announcement to make
[54.60 - 59.46] next week doing a wild blueberry drinks
[58.20 - 61.62] challenge which is going to be really

[112.56 - 116.82] 10 off they're running a sale on that
[114.78 - 118.02] you guys know I work with Wyman's a
[116.82 - 121.02] whole bit I want to keep this stuff
[118.02 - 123.12] around but listen we have an exciting
[121.02 - 125.82] topic today because this is important
[123.12 - 128.04] because people's immune systems are
[125.82 - 129.66] challenged people don't know how viruses
[128.04 - 131.04] work all of that so we're going to cover
[129.66 - 133.86] some cool information I'm going to read
[131.04 - 135.96] right here out of brain saver as well
[133.86 - 138.24] good to see you guys coming on
[135.96 - 140.40] so do you have the books too
[138.24 - 141.96] so let's find out what page we're on as
[140.40 - 144.00] well so these are the two books the
[141.96 - 148.26] brain saver books
[144.00 - 150.48] page 49 mm school and then school going
[148.26 - 153.42] down right now I'm just gonna say it
[150.48 - 155.04] page 49 right here brain saver so do you
[153.42 - 157.14] have your book
[155.04 - 160.56] so we can read together because that's
[157.14 - 163.14] fun I love reading with you guys
[160.56 - 166.98] so okay so I'm reading a part right here
[163.14 - 171.06] page 49 in brain saver living hungry
[166.98 - 172.92] viruses this section is mind blowing it
[171.06 - 174.96] really is this is a powerful piece of
[172.92 - 178.10] information right here so let me start
[174.96 - 181.98] for the record viruses are living
[178.10 - 183.60] important to know they are alive give
[181.98 - 186.96] you a little bit of an example when
[183.60 - 188.94] someone gets herpes simplex right so if
[186.96 - 192.00] someone has a cold sore
[188.94 - 193.26] and you kiss the person and they have
[192.00 - 196.44] the cold sore
[193.26 - 199.86] you then can get the cold sore not
[196.44 - 202.56] because the virus is dead if you get the
[199.86 - 206.10] cold sore because the virus is actually
[202.56 - 209.04] living it's alive it's inside the body
[206.10 - 212.94] it's in the sore it's in the saliva in
[209.04 - 215.46] that moment it's there okay so viruses
[212.94 - 219.60] are actually alive this is how cold
[215.46 - 222.96] sores herpes simplex one get trans
[219.60 - 225.00] minute to another person then that's how
[222.96 - 228.24] it's done it's because it is alive drink
[225.00 - 230.94] out of somebody's glass and they just
[228.24 - 233.64] shrank out of it whatever and then you
[230.94 - 235.26] you could be a year you get it later a
[233.64 - 236.58] year and it comes out but it could also
[235.26 - 239.04] come out pretty quick and that happens
[236.58 - 241.56] too depending on the variety of the
[239.04 - 243.24] Simplex in the cold sore virus as well
[241.56 - 245.82] but anyway let's go into this a little
[243.24 - 248.04] bit for the record viruses are living
[245.82 - 250.50] check this out in the publicly known
[248.04 - 253.08] Arena of science
[250.50 - 255.42] there is a battle about whether viruses
[253.08 - 258.12] are dead or alive
[255.42 - 260.88] no one can agree
[258.12 - 265.14] so in that public medical research and
[260.88 - 269.10] science Arena no one can agree and
[265.14 - 271.80] neither side has proven facts
[269.10 - 273.54] either side they don't have proven facts
[271.80 - 275.52] they cannot show it they cannot say no
[273.54 - 277.56] I'm going to show you the viruses alive
[275.52 - 279.00] and the other then the other side I'm
[277.56 - 280.62] going to show you the virus is dead and
[279.00 - 282.54] they still can't even show each other
[280.62 - 285.98] which is really incredible all on its
[282.54 - 291.12] own here is a pillar of Truth
[285.98 - 293.82] viruses are alive viruses are cells not
[291.12 - 295.32] a strand of something not something
[293.82 - 298.08] that's dead
[295.32 - 300.18] and viruses eat
[298.08 - 302.16] and they love food one of the favorite
[300.18 - 305.04] food viruses love is this food I'm
[302.16 - 307.56] holding in my hand right here that's one
[305.04 - 309.12] of its most favorite foods we'll talk
[307.56 - 313.58] about that too you guys recognize those
[309.12 - 313.58] right here crack one of these open
[314.46 - 318.96] get it in a pan get it cooking all right
[317.28 - 321.18] I want to protect my eggs right here I
[318.96 - 322.50] want to keep them here some baby chicks
[321.18 - 324.90] are going to hatch
[322.50 - 327.90] and I got to get them underneath the
[324.90 - 329.58] heat lamp so they stay warm so they
[327.90 - 331.38] hatch later on
[329.58 - 333.90] okay
[331.38 - 336.30] for a virus to live long enough inside
[333.90 - 339.00] the human body to create a chronic
[336.30 - 341.64] symptom or condition that's right
[339.00 - 342.96] do you have a chronic symptom
[341.64 - 345.36] do you have a chronic condition
[342.96 - 348.42] fibromyalgia
[345.36 - 350.78] R.A Hashimoto's
[348.42 - 352.80] psoriatic arthritis
[350.78 - 354.36] symptoms in general
[352.80 - 355.26] all kinds of different neurological
[354.36 - 357.72] symptoms
[355.26 - 359.52] do you have one of those
[357.72 - 361.50] for a virus to live long enough inside
[359.52 - 363.48] the human body to create a chronic
[361.50 - 366.24] symptom or condition it has to be able
[363.48 - 368.82] to find food to sustain itself
[366.24 - 372.06] the virus has to be able to find
[368.82 - 374.34] something to eat in order to stay alive
[372.06 - 377.58] inside your body
[374.34 - 379.80] it can't just live inside your body
[377.58 - 383.84] and just live there forever
[379.80 - 386.76] it needs a food source whether an old
[383.84 - 388.26] Well Spring of food inside your body
[386.76 - 390.54] meaning inside your liver or something
[388.26 - 393.78] you got something camped out in here for
[390.54 - 396.66] many years but it needs something or a
[393.78 - 399.06] new food you just ate that day it needs
[396.66 - 402.50] food in order to sustain itself to stay
[399.06 - 402.50] alive inside our body
[403.32 - 407.76] it has to be able to find a food source
[406.08 - 409.56] to sustain itself
[407.76 - 412.38] if you guys wonder what I'm reading page
[409.56 - 414.24] 49 mm school going down right now got
[412.38 - 416.64] the brain saver book Brain saver
[414.24 - 418.68] protocols book right there having some
[416.64 - 420.96] fun today
[418.68 - 424.08] yeah
[420.96 - 425.94] a virus does not have a mouth now this
[424.08 - 427.98] little virus here in my hand has a mouth
[425.94 - 433.14] right there and two eyes
[427.98 - 438.02] and some teeth and a nose now viruses do
[433.14 - 438.02] not have a mouth important to know
[438.84 - 445.02] so a virus does not have a mouth and if
[441.90 - 446.94] it's in okay sir as if it's an animal or
[445.02 - 450.42] a human eating
[446.94 - 454.32] instead a virus absorbs fuel
[450.42 - 457.74] through its viral cell membrane
[454.32 - 461.28] so it has absorption strength
[457.74 - 463.52] that's what a virus does it gets food
[461.28 - 465.78] through its membrane
[463.52 - 470.28] to eat
[465.78 - 471.90] a viral cell creates a vacuum effect now
[470.28 - 473.46] medical research inside doesn't know
[471.90 - 475.14] this
[473.46 - 477.96] so this is all advanced information
[475.14 - 480.36] about viruses and how they eat right
[477.96 - 482.10] here in brain saver so if you're new to
[480.36 - 483.78] Medical medium information you might be
[482.10 - 484.98] like oh great where did you research
[483.78 - 486.96] that
[484.98 - 488.58] oh God this guy's pretty cool where did
[486.96 - 490.20] he research that I want to know where
[488.58 - 491.70] that research paper is he must have done
[490.20 - 493.38] his research
[491.70 - 495.06] it's information that's unknown to
[493.38 - 496.92] medical research and science to all the
[495.06 - 499.14] clinics to all the universities they
[496.92 - 501.66] don't know this
[499.14 - 503.46] they know now a couple years they'll
[501.66 - 505.56] publish a paper
[503.46 - 507.72] plagiarizing this probably and not
[505.56 - 509.82] saving it they've done it already in
[507.72 - 511.80] different ways
[509.82 - 516.20] so this is important to know right here
[511.80 - 519.90] the viral cell has this vacuum effect
[516.20 - 521.88] temporarily drawing in water
[519.90 - 523.02] this is just unbelievable actually right
[521.88 - 526.32] here
[523.02 - 530.10] within the blood it draws water from
[526.32 - 532.14] your blood into the viral cell
[530.10 - 536.96] that's what it does creates a vacuum
[532.14 - 536.96] effect and draws water into its cell
[537.96 - 540.90] and then
[539.46 - 544.86] right
[540.90 - 546.78] in that water is viral fuel
[544.86 - 548.46] and that's the next part so say you got
[546.78 - 550.20] egg particles
[548.46 - 551.76] that have been broken down by your
[550.20 - 553.80] digestion
[551.76 - 555.36] that entered the bloodstream up the
[553.80 - 557.94] hepatocortal vein
[555.36 - 560.94] got into your main Highway
[557.94 - 563.40] got into your bloodstream
[560.94 - 567.08] and those egg particles
[563.40 - 567.08] are floating around throughout the body
[568.62 - 573.00] well the viral cell creates a vacuum
[570.90 - 575.88] effect temporarily drawing in water
[573.00 - 578.40] within the blood that's filled with egg
[575.88 - 579.96] particles I'm just using egg as an
[578.40 - 582.48] example it's not the only thing viruses
[579.96 - 585.00] love to eat
[582.48 - 589.20] and here's the cool part
[585.00 - 591.06] it draws in this water filled with viral
[589.20 - 593.46] fuel like egg particles or some other
[591.06 - 596.22] food
[593.46 - 597.42] through any area of the viral cell
[596.22 - 599.46] membrane
[597.42 - 602.76] so it's not like it has a mouth or it
[599.46 - 605.16] only vacuums it up through one aspect of
[602.76 - 607.86] the cell membrane the virus actually
[605.16 - 611.16] absorbs the food through any part of the
[607.86 - 614.04] cell membrane so it absorbs that water
[611.16 - 617.58] from your bloodstream with that fuel in
[614.04 - 620.34] it and it enters into the cell at any
[617.58 - 622.88] place around the cell so any part of the
[620.34 - 622.88] viral cell
[624.96 - 628.56] and then immediately excreting that
[627.36 - 630.78] fluid
[628.56 - 631.98] through any other part of the cell
[630.78 - 634.08] membrane
[631.98 - 637.32] so here's the other thing so it can
[634.08 - 640.32] actually excrete that fluid
[637.32 - 643.64] if a virus is highly active like simplex
[640.32 - 647.34] one we've got a cold sore Simplex 2
[643.64 - 649.44] right you got a blister somewhere a
[647.34 - 651.72] genital area
[649.44 - 653.76] you got that you're active it's active
[651.72 - 655.50] or you got mono or you got an
[653.76 - 657.54] Epstein-Barr that's out and about and
[655.50 - 658.74] it's doing its thing or you're about to
[657.54 - 660.30] come down with the shingles virus
[658.74 - 662.70] because the shingles is inside of you
[660.30 - 664.68] people spread the shingles virus all the
[662.70 - 668.58] time to other people it's really easy to
[664.68 - 671.40] do or hhv6 or hhv7 or any of the number
[668.58 - 674.58] of Epstein-Barr viruses
[671.40 - 677.70] the virus is highly active it will need
[674.58 - 680.30] to feed on viral fuel on an hour hourly
[677.70 - 680.30] basis
[680.52 - 687.42] so viruses don't intermittent fast
[684.68 - 689.76] that's an important thing to know
[687.42 - 692.04] viruses are not on the intermittent
[689.76 - 695.12] fasting diet
[692.04 - 698.66] viruses need to feed every single hour
[695.12 - 698.66] when they're active
[700.50 - 705.18] so
[702.12 - 708.54] Michelle L hey like ourselves absorb
[705.18 - 710.64] stuff very similar
[708.54 - 713.22] if a virus is highly active it will need
[710.64 - 715.98] a feed every hour if the virus is
[713.22 - 718.86] inactive or even dormant it will need to
[715.98 - 721.26] feed on viral fuel on a weekly to
[718.86 - 723.60] monthly basis
[721.26 - 726.96] Lulu says what do you mean vacuum effect
[723.60 - 729.24] the virus can actually distort its
[726.96 - 732.06] cell-like body and create a vacuum
[729.24 - 733.80] effect drawing water from your
[732.06 - 736.14] bloodstream through the membrane of the
[733.80 - 739.56] virus into the virus itself and then
[736.14 - 740.82] excreting that water back out but
[739.56 - 744.18] leaving
[740.82 - 746.28] bits and pieces of particles behind a
[744.18 - 748.80] food that it likes
[746.28 - 752.52] viruses do like dairy products viruses
[748.80 - 753.78] like eggs viruses like gluten and you
[752.52 - 755.16] might say oh he's talking about gluten
[753.78 - 757.20] I'm sure there's tons of research on
[755.16 - 759.78] that there isn't
[757.20 - 762.24] they didn't know until the medically in
[759.78 - 763.50] books that pathogens feed on gluten
[762.24 - 765.48] itself and that's where the problem
[763.50 - 766.92] really lies that's why someone can eat
[765.48 - 768.30] gluten their whole life and not have a
[766.92 - 770.70] problem
[768.30 - 772.20] because the pathogens are either not
[770.70 - 774.12] inside their body or they don't have
[772.20 - 776.52] enough pathogens or the right kind of
[774.12 - 778.08] pathogens they don't have viruses and
[776.52 - 780.90] the viruses aren't feeding on that
[778.08 - 783.84] gluten somebody else could have two or
[780.90 - 785.46] three Epstein bars a shingles virus hb6
[783.84 - 787.14] they can have herpes simplex one and
[785.46 - 789.42] when they eat gluten
[787.14 - 791.28] the viruses go to town and feed on that
[789.42 - 795.00] gluten
[791.28 - 797.88] and that's why a person that's 16 17 18
[795.00 - 799.68] 20 years old 25 years old can have a
[797.88 - 802.98] problem with gluten and then that 80
[799.68 - 805.38] year old guy down the road doesn't have
[802.98 - 807.78] a problem with food
[805.38 - 809.64] and the Doom says I saw one of the
[807.78 - 810.78] podcast doctors talking about thick
[809.64 - 813.54] blood today
[810.78 - 814.50] hmm wonder where that one key got that
[813.54 - 817.50] one
[814.50 - 821.90] yeah that's actually real pleasure
[817.50 - 821.90] plagiarism at its best right there
[825.68 - 832.56] ah What a Wonderful World it is
[829.98 - 835.86] okay let's move on a little bit good
[832.56 - 838.88] stuff in here Tammy says virus draws in
[835.86 - 838.88] water dot dot dot
[839.28 - 845.28] is that one of the reasons people with
[841.38 - 846.60] virus can feel dehydrated it's it's not
[845.28 - 848.64] one of the reasons why usually people
[846.60 - 849.72] are just chronically dehydrated Tammy
[848.64 - 851.70] and thanks for the question it's really
[849.72 - 854.60] cool it's a great question you're over
[851.70 - 854.60] there on Facebook awesome
[854.64 - 859.08] if the virus is inactive like I said it
[856.86 - 860.64] could take a week to do a feeding it
[859.08 - 864.60] could take a month to do a feeding if
[860.64 - 867.36] the virus is really dormant and inactive
[864.60 - 870.06] the virus has an ability to expel almost
[867.36 - 872.82] all fluid out of its cell structure so
[870.06 - 875.58] it can then be refilled and new fluid
[872.82 - 877.56] that Harbors the viral fuel how insane
[875.58 - 879.90] is that
[877.56 - 882.12] let's see
[879.90 - 885.00] which page are you reading over there on
[882.12 - 886.98] YouTube I'm reading page 49 doing a
[885.00 - 887.94] little mm spool for the moment just fun
[886.98 - 890.34] stuff
[887.94 - 892.62] we got brain saver you there's two books
[890.34 - 894.86] right you know about that brand saber
[892.62 - 898.38] protocols get them at amazon.com us
[894.86 - 901.32] they're over 40 off right now I was like
[898.38 - 903.00] oh my God amazon.com us
[901.32 - 904.86] and they're just they're they're heavy
[903.00 - 907.50] books just forewarning I saw somebody
[904.86 - 909.72] did complain and I felt bad because they
[907.50 - 911.64] were like oh my God like when they got
[909.72 - 913.20] it delivered to them they're like I
[911.64 - 915.30] didn't know these books were that big
[913.20 - 917.88] that failed I mean
[915.30 - 920.42] the information is so vast and insane in
[917.88 - 920.42] these books
[920.58 - 926.28] Maria says can Gloria chlorine dioxide
[923.28 - 927.72] work to kill the viruses if you look in
[926.28 - 930.06] the brain saver you'll see I talk about
[927.72 - 931.68] chlorine dioxide
[930.06 - 935.48] and I talk about how it doesn't work
[931.68 - 935.48] check it out it's in here
[936.60 - 940.14] all right
[938.28 - 942.30] but it took about like the information
[940.14 - 945.18] and protocols in the books
[942.30 - 947.88] if you're concerned about that
[945.18 - 950.52] so the virus has an ability to expel
[947.88 - 951.66] almost all fluid out of its cell
[950.52 - 954.36] structure
[951.66 - 957.78] so it can then be refilled with new
[954.36 - 959.16] fluid that Harbors viral fuel so you
[957.78 - 961.08] ready for this
[959.16 - 966.30] the buyers
[961.08 - 971.70] can squeeze out all fluid out of itself
[966.30 - 974.28] and then vacuum up a whole new batch
[971.70 - 978.26] of water from your bloodstream filled
[974.28 - 978.26] with more viral fuel
[981.12 - 986.22] when the virus is active and feeding
[983.40 - 989.04] regularly its viral cells are
[986.22 - 991.20] continually excreting all of their
[989.04 - 994.70] contents through their cell membranes so
[991.20 - 998.22] here's where we get in trouble
[994.70 - 1000.32] here's where we get in trouble it's one
[998.22 - 1002.00] of the places
[1000.32 - 1004.28] and before I move on that I want to say
[1002.00 - 1006.38] one other thing too
[1004.28 - 1008.66] eggs are not the only thing they eat so
[1006.38 - 1010.70] I want to make that clear eggs are not
[1008.66 - 1011.96] the only thing viruses eat virus swims
[1010.70 - 1015.16] in your body
[1011.96 - 1015.16] it just loves those eggs
[1015.92 - 1020.00] all right
[1017.96 - 1021.50] viruses love toxic heavy metals they
[1020.00 - 1023.12] love dairy products they love gluten
[1021.50 - 1025.10] they love lots of things I've talked
[1023.12 - 1026.60] about this in all of the eight medical
[1025.10 - 1029.98] medium books
[1026.60 - 1029.98] on the medical mean book series
[1031.76 - 1035.78] when the virus is active in feeding on a
[1034.16 - 1038.60] regular basis check this out you guys
[1035.78 - 1042.10] this is this is all like
[1038.60 - 1042.10] what huh
[1043.28 - 1046.82] I mean it's incredible really I mean
[1045.20 - 1050.36] when I was getting the information on
[1046.82 - 1053.60] this alone I was just like oh my God
[1050.36 - 1056.60] this is like mind-blowing
[1053.60 - 1058.82] so when a virus is feeding a lot because
[1056.60 - 1061.22] it's really highly active
[1058.82 - 1063.14] its viral cells are continually
[1061.22 - 1064.52] excreting right all of their contents
[1063.14 - 1067.04] through the cell membranes making
[1064.52 - 1069.32] someone who has the viral infection
[1067.04 - 1071.36] experience heightened symptoms
[1069.32 - 1072.50] so here's how it works
[1071.36 - 1074.36] I'm just going to give you a quick
[1072.50 - 1075.98] rundown on some symptoms right now I
[1074.36 - 1077.30] mean there's 300 symptoms and conditions
[1075.98 - 1078.86] in these books
[1077.30 - 1080.66] I mean check them out when you can you
[1078.86 - 1082.82] can go to amazon.com and get them over
[1080.66 - 1084.62] 40 off but check this out or for library
[1082.82 - 1087.44] for free go to the library for free
[1084.62 - 1089.18] so when somebody has a viral infection
[1087.44 - 1090.68] they don't know they have that their
[1089.18 - 1092.30] doctor can't tell them their doctor's
[1090.68 - 1094.10] not telling them they're going from
[1092.30 - 1095.42] Doctor to doctor to doctor they're
[1094.10 - 1096.92] looking for answers they're going to
[1095.42 - 1099.92] neurologists and Specialists and
[1096.92 - 1102.14] internists they don't know why their jaw
[1099.92 - 1103.94] pain that's mysterious
[1102.14 - 1106.58] their neck pain that's mysterious
[1103.94 - 1108.86] they're burning skin feeling
[1106.58 - 1110.78] they're vibrating their body vibrating
[1108.86 - 1113.06] they're tremors
[1110.78 - 1115.46] their ticks and their spasms
[1113.06 - 1117.74] they're ringing in the ears they're
[1115.46 - 1119.96] vertigo and dizziness
[1117.74 - 1123.56] feeling like they're on a boat
[1119.96 - 1125.84] right they're popping and buzzing in the
[1123.56 - 1128.06] ears
[1125.84 - 1129.20] right they're burning gums burning
[1128.06 - 1131.72] tongue
[1129.20 - 1133.70] pain everywhere they're trigeminal
[1131.72 - 1136.28] neuralgia their back pain that's a
[1133.70 - 1139.04] mystery their feet pain that's a mystery
[1136.28 - 1141.74] they're restless leg syndrome you guys
[1139.04 - 1143.72] like right all these symptoms and these
[1141.74 - 1145.52] are just some they're tingles throughout
[1143.72 - 1147.44] their body that's mysterious Tangles on
[1145.52 - 1149.66] their nose their face
[1147.44 - 1152.78] all these different symptoms they don't
[1149.66 - 1155.06] realize are viral they don't know that
[1152.78 - 1157.04] and the doctor doesn't know that if you
[1155.06 - 1158.96] hear that on on a podcast somewhere of a
[1157.04 - 1161.12] doctor talk about it it's published
[1158.96 - 1163.30] medical meme info and nobody knew any of
[1161.12 - 1163.30] this
[1164.42 - 1169.66] Tiffany Scott says Anthony I have sent
[1166.28 - 1172.52] you messages about my story healing
[1169.66 - 1177.70] whoa your bronchitis and I never heard
[1172.52 - 1177.70] back I'm Healed oh my God incredible
[1177.74 - 1182.42] incredible
[1179.42 - 1185.66] I might not have seen them I mean
[1182.42 - 1188.54] I'm not trying to like say anything
[1185.66 - 1191.90] but a lot of stuff is hidden
[1188.54 - 1194.00] like there's a lot of glitches on IG and
[1191.90 - 1196.22] other platforms and it's a lot of stuff
[1194.00 - 1197.84] that I never see
[1196.22 - 1202.46] and there's a lot of stuff you guys
[1197.84 - 1205.28] never see too which is just it's sad
[1202.46 - 1207.08] okay you ready you guys
[1205.28 - 1209.60] the reason why I was saying the problem
[1207.08 - 1212.06] is if the virus is really active and
[1209.60 - 1215.18] it's feeding a lot and it's eating a lot
[1212.06 - 1218.78] and it's on a regular basis that means
[1215.18 - 1221.42] when the virus takes in the fuel
[1218.78 - 1224.78] into the virus
[1221.42 - 1228.68] eats it and then excretes it's excreting
[1224.78 - 1231.62] a neurotoxin so now the virus is
[1228.68 - 1233.30] excreting byproduct out of it which
[1231.62 - 1235.34] could be neurotoxins of all kinds of
[1233.30 - 1236.90] varieties depending on what the virus is
[1235.34 - 1239.78] feeding on
[1236.90 - 1242.18] if the virus is feeding on copper so
[1239.78 - 1243.98] don't drink out of the copper fasks and
[1242.18 - 1246.08] don't you know don't do the whole copper
[1243.98 - 1248.30] thing you got to be careful if the virus
[1246.08 - 1250.52] is feeding off of copper then you're
[1248.30 - 1253.40] going to be getting like all kinds of
[1250.52 - 1257.66] stuff eczema psoriasis
[1253.40 - 1260.54] so the virus actually fills up with all
[1257.66 - 1262.76] kinds of food eats it and then excretes
[1260.54 - 1266.78] it on a regular basis
[1262.76 - 1269.68] and here's the deal that toxic stuff
[1266.78 - 1273.02] that the virus is excreting you guys
[1269.68 - 1275.54] circulates in the bloodstream and lands
[1273.02 - 1278.48] on nerves and now you've got vagus
[1275.54 - 1280.76] nerves that are inflamed because you're
[1278.48 - 1283.76] really highly active with the low-grade
[1280.76 - 1287.06] or higher grade viral infection so now
[1283.76 - 1288.62] you got nerve problems
[1287.06 - 1290.00] you got the vertigo you got the
[1288.62 - 1291.50] dizziness you got the ringing in the
[1290.00 - 1292.88] ears the tinnitus you've got all the
[1291.50 - 1294.62] different aches and pains the burning
[1292.88 - 1296.96] skin you got the Restless Leg Syndrome I
[1294.62 - 1298.52] could go on and on and on
[1296.96 - 1300.98] and then you're going to get all kinds
[1298.52 - 1302.72] of diagnoses oh wait the doctor thinks I
[1300.98 - 1304.70] have Lupus the doctor thinks I have MS
[1302.72 - 1306.26] and doctor thinks I just have five row
[1304.70 - 1308.12] the doctor thinks I'm crazy you're just
[1306.26 - 1310.40] gonna it's gonna be all these different
[1308.12 - 1312.92] things
[1310.40 - 1319.12] that's what happens when the bug is
[1312.92 - 1319.12] gobbling up and excreting and excreting
[1320.84 - 1330.10] the publicly known medical industry
[1325.52 - 1330.10] is completely unaware that viruses eat
[1330.26 - 1336.02] that's a medical medium
[1333.26 - 1337.88] and medical medium science piece of
[1336.02 - 1339.80] information
[1337.88 - 1342.38] a publicly known medical industry is
[1339.80 - 1343.88] completely unaware you guys that viruses
[1342.38 - 1346.82] eat
[1343.88 - 1349.34] they have not seen it studied it written
[1346.82 - 1351.26] a paper on it
[1349.34 - 1353.66] it is medical medium information a
[1351.26 - 1357.56] viruses eat the classified get ready for
[1353.66 - 1360.56] this the classified medical industry
[1357.56 - 1360.56] knows
[1361.82 - 1367.76] classified medical industry
[1365.06 - 1372.40] knows because the classified medical
[1367.76 - 1372.40] industry feeds viruses and breeds them
[1372.74 - 1378.80] Harvard wherever medical universities
[1376.04 - 1381.92] clinics
[1378.80 - 1385.34] everywhere around the world
[1381.92 - 1387.98] don't know viruses eat they have no clue
[1385.34 - 1390.86] and no idea all the doctors they Stamp
[1387.98 - 1392.90] Out have no idea viruses eat
[1390.86 - 1394.70] but classified medical research in
[1392.90 - 1398.48] science which is completely a different
[1394.70 - 1401.12] world and separated it's separated
[1398.48 - 1402.92] completely from all public university
[1401.12 - 1404.90] medical research and science to
[1402.92 - 1406.94] Everything Medical Schools it's
[1404.90 - 1408.98] completely separated
[1406.94 - 1410.54] and the classified medical industry
[1408.98 - 1413.90] knows
[1410.54 - 1415.88] that viruses actually eat because the
[1413.90 - 1419.24] classified medical industry
[1415.88 - 1422.90] feeds the viruses and then breeds them
[1419.24 - 1425.90] keeps them alive in their labs and uses
[1422.90 - 1428.14] viruses food of choice preferably raw
[1425.90 - 1428.14] egg
[1428.36 - 1433.54] iron
[1430.70 - 1433.54] and Mercury

[1435.56 - 1440.36] learning right here
[1437.72 - 1442.46] is mind-blowing

[1491.60 - 1494.38] I'm excited
[1494.42 - 1498.56] but I'm really stuck on this piece of
[1496.16 - 1501.56] information right here like I'm stuck on
[1498.56 - 1503.30] this like this is insane
[1501.56 - 1505.78] check this out
[1503.30 - 1505.78] okay
[1506.54 - 1509.72] the classified medical industry knows
[1508.34 - 1511.46] because classified medical industry
[1509.72 - 1514.16] feeds a virus but check this out they
[1511.46 - 1516.68] feed them a preferable food that the
[1514.16 - 1519.02] viruses love
[1516.68 - 1520.88] which is eggs
[1519.02 - 1522.56] iron
[1520.88 - 1524.72] iron
[1522.56 - 1526.58] know why people are they have all that
[1524.72 - 1527.90] different iron deficiencies it's all
[1526.58 - 1529.64] mystery to medical research and science
[1527.90 - 1531.62] why they have iron deficiencies
[1529.64 - 1533.38] whether anemia and all that is happening
[1531.62 - 1536.84] and it's happening rampantly right now
[1533.38 - 1539.30] viruses feed on iron inside the person's
[1536.84 - 1541.16] blood making them anemic so it's
[1539.30 - 1543.62] mysterious
[1541.16 - 1545.18] to the doctors in public medical
[1543.62 - 1547.10] research and science
[1545.18 - 1549.50] and of course Mercury that's another one
[1547.10 - 1551.60] too other Foods the classified medical
[1549.50 - 1553.94] industry feeds viruses to keep them
[1551.60 - 1555.98] alive are gluten
[1553.94 - 1560.00] which nobody knows that
[1555.98 - 1561.92] Dairy nobody knows that and GMO medical
[1560.00 - 1563.80] grade corn
[1561.92 - 1568.58] so the classified medical industry
[1563.80 - 1571.16] sometimes uses GMO medical grade corn to
[1568.58 - 1573.94] feed the bugs they breed raise
[1571.16 - 1573.94] in labs
[1574.70 - 1578.42] here's another interesting part right
[1576.62 - 1581.86] here I mean do you guys have the books
[1578.42 - 1581.86] I'm on page 49.
[1582.44 - 1587.18] one of the problems of the publicly
[1584.60 - 1591.56] known medical industry when it comes to
[1587.18 - 1593.72] viruses is that it's so underfunded in
[1591.56 - 1595.46] this area so you got to keep in mind too
[1593.72 - 1597.02] the reason why public medical research
[1595.46 - 1601.28] science doesn't know anything about
[1597.02 - 1604.12] viruses is because it's underfunded
[1601.28 - 1604.12] that's why
[1604.70 - 1608.72] no one can find the truth even if they
[1607.16 - 1612.56] want to
[1608.72 - 1615.08] unless they grab a medical medium book
[1612.56 - 1616.82] so they hash out theories that are all
[1615.08 - 1618.86] on paper because they're not allowed to
[1616.82 - 1621.14] study viruses adequately so just so you
[1618.86 - 1624.92] know publicly known medical research and
[1621.14 - 1627.62] science are not allowed to study viruses
[1624.92 - 1629.60] they're allowed to talk viruses and talk
[1627.62 - 1632.06] virus theories they're not allowed to
[1629.60 - 1634.28] study them
[1632.06 - 1636.10] Never mind take a virus of choice and
[1634.28 - 1638.60] look at it under a microscope so
[1636.10 - 1641.26] publicly known medical research in
[1638.60 - 1644.12] science are not allowed to take viruses
[1641.26 - 1646.52] study them under a microscope
[1644.12 - 1648.50] and figure out how they work
[1646.52 - 1651.94] it's not allowed in the public medical
[1648.50 - 1653.90] research and science Arena
[1651.94 - 1656.00] virologists are not allowed to do that
[1653.90 - 1658.94] they're allowed to be a virologist but
[1656.00 - 1662.68] they're not allowed to do that
[1658.94 - 1666.82] very few doctors are scientists that get
[1662.68 - 1669.68] authorization check this out
[1666.82 - 1672.62] very few doctors here in the public
[1669.68 - 1675.44] medical research and science Arena
[1672.62 - 1678.16] get authorization
[1675.44 - 1678.16] from
[1678.62 - 1683.60] The Wizard of Oz
[1681.38 - 1686.78] and the outcomes are always vague
[1683.60 - 1689.18] obscure and inconclusive so if
[1686.78 - 1692.96] a medical doctor does want to study
[1689.18 - 1694.16] viruses very few in the world in the
[1692.96 - 1697.10] public medical research and science
[1694.16 - 1699.02] Arena are allowed to look at a virus and
[1697.10 - 1700.76] their conclusions are always vague and
[1699.02 - 1702.98] obscure
[1700.76 - 1705.08] inconclusive
[1702.98 - 1707.18] so the publicly known medical industry
[1705.08 - 1709.22] stays stuck in its war with itself over
[1707.18 - 1713.18] whether viruses are just a dead strand
[1709.22 - 1715.96] of RNA and protein
[1713.18 - 1720.87] or they're alive
[1715.96 - 1720.87] [Music]
[1723.44 - 1728.12] many medical professionals believe
[1725.18 - 1730.94] viruses are only alive if they're an
[1728.12 - 1733.90] influenza
[1730.94 - 1733.90] flu strain
[1735.44 - 1740.74] so keep that in mind that's the only
[1738.14 - 1743.42] time it's allowed
[1740.74 - 1745.22] and Epstein-Barr is not alive to the
[1743.42 - 1747.80] medical research at Science World uh
[1745.22 - 1749.24] yeah shingles is not alive uh nothing's
[1747.80 - 1751.88] alive
[1749.24 - 1753.68] not even simplex one is alive nothing's
[1751.88 - 1754.96] alive in the world of medical research
[1753.68 - 1758.42] and science
[1754.96 - 1762.14] but many many medical professionals
[1758.42 - 1764.06] believe viruses are alive only
[1762.14 - 1768.40] the ones that do believe they're alive
[1764.06 - 1768.40] only believe influences alive
[1769.04 - 1773.30] and even then it remains questionable
[1771.26 - 1775.10] because of this ongoing internal War
[1773.30 - 1777.86] you're not allowed to look at the
[1775.10 - 1779.18] influenza influenza under the microscope
[1777.86 - 1782.36] as a doctor
[1779.18 - 1784.82] granted or funded to do so so you really
[1782.36 - 1787.30] don't know if the flu is actually alive
[1784.82 - 1787.30] or not
[1787.64 - 1792.08] you guys following me on this stuff the
[1789.62 - 1794.00] publicly known medical industry has to
[1792.08 - 1795.86] work with theories kind of like
[1794.00 - 1798.92] astronomers do
[1795.86 - 1800.90] as an astronomer you go to bed at night
[1798.92 - 1803.06] dreaming about what you might discover
[1800.90 - 1805.70] behind the stars with your telescope
[1803.06 - 1808.88] right so if you're into the stars and
[1805.70 - 1810.68] you go to school to be an astronomer
[1808.88 - 1813.68] you basically just go to bed at night
[1810.68 - 1816.68] wondering what's behind those Stars
[1813.68 - 1818.36] the same thing as a virologist in the
[1816.68 - 1819.98] publicly known medical industry you go
[1818.36 - 1822.62] to bed at night dreaming that someday
[1819.98 - 1826.58] you may get funded
[1822.62 - 1828.56] and truly discover what a virus does
[1826.58 - 1831.34] so if you want to grow up someday and
[1828.56 - 1831.34] become a virologist
[1831.98 - 1835.28] you're going to be going to bed every
[1833.30 - 1837.92] night wondering what a virus really does
[1835.28 - 1840.74] and in hopes that maybe you get funded
[1837.92 - 1844.18] to get a chance to look at a virus
[1840.74 - 1846.50] if you're lucky and if you do
[1844.18 - 1848.06] inconclusive that's what your study
[1846.50 - 1851.08] paper will say
[1848.06 - 1851.08] I wonder why
[1851.60 - 1854.66] and then you're gonna and then you're in
[1853.28 - 1857.96] bed at night wondering as a virologist
[1854.66 - 1861.82] is a virus even alive or not maybe it's
[1857.96 - 1861.82] an RNA DNA strand
[1862.22 - 1866.00] in the meantime you keep yourself busy
[1864.14 - 1868.82] in your career attending meetings and
[1866.00 - 1871.10] medical com you know conventions and
[1868.82 - 1872.54] reading other colleagues theoretical
[1871.10 - 1874.70] papers
[1872.54 - 1877.76] and you listen to that Lucky Devil who
[1874.70 - 1879.50] was funded briefly who's up on the stage
[1877.76 - 1881.12] at a convention talking about their
[1879.50 - 1883.70] theory of what they think they
[1881.12 - 1886.88] discovered that's the Grim reality of
[1883.70 - 1888.50] the publicly known medical industry
[1886.88 - 1889.82] you guys were reading right here at
[1888.50 - 1891.38] brain saver
[1889.82 - 1893.48] we got the brain saver books right here
[1891.38 - 1895.22] we're doing a little virus talk if you
[1893.48 - 1897.26] guys don't mind it's pretty cool I mean
[1895.22 - 1900.32] I love this information when I receive
[1897.26 - 1902.36] the information I was so like oh my God
[1900.32 - 1904.12] this is unbelievable the information's
[1902.36 - 1906.32] incredible
[1904.12 - 1907.82] that's my opinion you might have a
[1906.32 - 1908.78] different opinion you're like well I
[1907.82 - 1911.90] don't know
[1908.78 - 1913.52] the classified medical industry is a
[1911.90 - 1916.18] whole other game
[1913.52 - 1916.18] uh oh
[1916.88 - 1922.34] they know that viruses eat
[1919.64 - 1925.28] they do
[1922.34 - 1927.68] SOC has told me they do
[1925.28 - 1931.58] they feed the viruses
[1927.68 - 1933.82] uh-huh they do
[1931.58 - 1937.10] they grow viruses
[1933.82 - 1939.98] proliferate viruses and altar viruses
[1937.10 - 1942.16] and every now and then one escapes the
[1939.98 - 1942.16] lab
[1942.32 - 1946.28] this is what the classified medical
[1944.30 - 1949.16] industry has been doing for over a
[1946.28 - 1953.24] hundred years now since the Spanish Flu
[1949.16 - 1953.24] was released in 1918.
[1953.36 - 1959.00] this is what classified medical research
[1956.72 - 1961.66] and science has been doing for over a
[1959.00 - 1961.66] hundred years now
[1963.40 - 1968.18] the classified medical industry knows
[1966.02 - 1970.22] more about viruses much more than the
[1968.18 - 1972.08] publicly known medical industry which is
[1970.22 - 1974.54] your doctor at the doctor's office your
[1972.08 - 1976.76] scientists at the science lab
[1974.54 - 1981.02] your University Medical you know
[1976.76 - 1983.66] researcher whatever they don't know
[1981.02 - 1986.54] remember this
[1983.66 - 1988.76] I repeat remember this
[1986.54 - 1991.22] viruses are alive
[1988.76 - 1995.98] viruses eat
[1991.22 - 1995.98] and viruses are a single cell
[1997.82 - 2004.30] that is viruses are single cell living
[2001.30 - 2004.30] microorganisms
[2005.68 - 2010.90] while it's always possible through a
[2007.48 - 2013.12] mutation change a mutated change
[2010.90 - 2015.76] for them to become multi-cell living
[2013.12 - 2019.18] microorganisms
[2015.76 - 2022.12] we'll talk here about single cells
[2019.18 - 2025.30] because as time check goes by and
[2022.12 - 2027.34] they're messed with anything's possible
[2025.30 - 2030.94] the most appropriate term for these
[2027.34 - 2033.76] single cell microorganisms is viral cell
[2030.94 - 2036.78] that's the most appropriate term for
[2033.76 - 2036.78] what's ailing people
[2037.06 - 2041.08] as we get into the details of how
[2039.04 - 2043.30] viruses inflame the central nervous
[2041.08 - 2045.10] system and cause life-altering symptoms
[2043.30 - 2047.80] and conditions in the process because
[2045.10 - 2050.92] you guys that's what's happening right
[2047.80 - 2053.32] now you've got a whole world of sick
[2050.92 - 2055.54] people developing they're developing
[2053.32 - 2058.24] with neurological symptoms
[2055.54 - 2059.98] the brain saver books are here for that
[2058.24 - 2062.28] right
[2059.98 - 2065.02] but this is what everybody's
[2062.28 - 2068.40] experiencing and living with
[2065.02 - 2068.40] that's how it's going now
[2070.18 - 2074.20] the reality that viruses are hungry
[2072.16 - 2076.36] living microorganisms will be
[2074.20 - 2079.00] foundational knowledge
[2076.36 - 2081.36] in the future if they're going to save
[2079.00 - 2081.36] people
[2081.46 - 2086.44] from pain and suffering
[2084.76 - 2087.64] so I got a little bit more to read if
[2086.44 - 2089.50] you guys are up for it I just want to
[2087.64 - 2092.14] give you a little 4-1-1 making an
[2089.50 - 2095.32] announcement and I made an announcement
[2092.14 - 2097.42] I'm excited for the two day free Wild
[2095.32 - 2098.92] blueberry challenge but it's a drink
[2097.42 - 2100.06] challenge which is really cool and
[2098.92 - 2101.56] that's going to be fun I'm going to make
[2100.06 - 2103.90] all these different drinks and since the
[2101.56 - 2105.76] holidays are happening it might be
[2103.90 - 2108.34] really fun and you get to stay away from
[2105.76 - 2109.66] alcohol yeah you might not want to stay
[2108.34 - 2111.70] away from alcohol because you might like
[2109.66 - 2114.34] alcohol you might be somebody who likes
[2111.70 - 2117.04] alcohol and I get it but like it'd be
[2114.34 - 2118.96] nice to give your body a break and maybe
[2117.04 - 2122.14] do a whole bunch of drinks that don't
[2118.96 - 2125.80] have alcohol in them and instead are
[2122.14 - 2127.60] really high in antioxidants really high
[2125.80 - 2128.92] in antioxidants that would be really
[2127.60 - 2132.22] cool
[2128.92 - 2133.66] go to medicalme.com and you will see or
[2132.22 - 2135.22] Link in the description Link in the
[2133.66 - 2137.80] profile
[2135.22 - 2140.44] definitely download your free grocery
[2137.80 - 2142.78] shopping list get on the medical medium
[2140.44 - 2145.42] newsletter
[2142.78 - 2147.46] brain cells are highly vulnerable
[2145.42 - 2149.68] so that's the thing with brain cells
[2147.46 - 2151.24] they're different than other cells
[2149.68 - 2153.10] inside our body other cells are inside
[2151.24 - 2157.08] our body
[2153.10 - 2157.08] are not as vulnerable
[2158.56 - 2164.86] brain cells have to be pure and clean
[2162.04 - 2167.86] unlike the liver which is meant to be a
[2164.86 - 2170.38] filter for the body so your liver cells
[2167.86 - 2173.40] are meant to be a filter for your body I
[2170.38 - 2173.40] hope this doesn't fall out
[2173.62 - 2178.60] these cells are tougher
[2175.90 - 2179.80] these cells are meant to handle some
[2178.60 - 2182.14] dirt
[2179.80 - 2185.80] that's what your cells in your liver are
[2182.14 - 2187.00] meant to do they're meant to handle some
[2185.80 - 2188.92] dirt
[2187.00 - 2190.06] and some grime
[2188.92 - 2192.40] okay
[2190.06 - 2194.56] but your brain cells
[2192.40 - 2197.44] much more fragile
[2194.56 - 2198.40] they're designed to just be pure and
[2197.44 - 2200.20] clean
[2198.40 - 2202.48] and that's the difference so when it
[2200.20 - 2205.96] comes down to brain cells they have to
[2202.48 - 2211.00] be pure and clean
[2205.96 - 2213.28] it can't be dirty cells your liver
[2211.00 - 2215.14] has dirty cells
[2213.28 - 2216.88] now you don't want your liver saturated
[2215.14 - 2218.38] with so much gunking problems and
[2216.88 - 2220.54] everything you want to know the medical
[2218.38 - 2222.16] meme information to clean up your liver
[2220.54 - 2223.72] because you clean up your liver you
[2222.16 - 2225.10] clean up your brain because that means
[2223.72 - 2227.02] less stuff gets in the brain so let's
[2225.10 - 2229.12] get into that
[2227.02 - 2231.16] unlike the liver which is meant to be a
[2229.12 - 2233.20] filter for the body the brain is never
[2231.16 - 2236.16] meant to be a physical filter but guess
[2233.20 - 2239.26] what you guys ADHD
[2236.16 - 2242.62] depersonalization brain fog
[2239.26 - 2245.94] focus and concentration issues
[2242.62 - 2245.94] depression anxiety
[2246.64 - 2252.46] 100 other different symptoms
[2249.22 - 2254.14] our brain becomes the filter
[2252.46 - 2257.08] so our brain
[2254.14 - 2259.42] is bringing in it doesn't want to bring
[2257.08 - 2261.94] in but it ends up bringing in
[2259.42 - 2263.68] our body brings brings in lots of toxins
[2261.94 - 2265.24] and poisons that get to the brain cells
[2263.68 - 2267.46] and the brain cells aren't pure and
[2265.24 - 2269.08] clean anymore they get heavy metals in
[2267.46 - 2271.18] them and so many other different toxins
[2269.08 - 2272.38] and poisons that we talk about all the
[2271.18 - 2275.04] time and we talk about in the brain
[2272.38 - 2275.04] saver books
[2275.86 - 2278.94] just mind-blowing information
[2279.40 - 2284.28] your brain should never be a filter in
[2282.04 - 2287.86] this scent in this sense
[2284.28 - 2290.26] toxins your brain should only be a
[2287.86 - 2292.50] filter in the sense of processing
[2290.26 - 2292.50] information
[2292.60 - 2297.34] that's when your brain is a filter when
[2294.94 - 2299.98] it's processing information
[2297.34 - 2301.48] but your brain is not supposed to be a
[2299.98 - 2303.96] physical filter
[2301.48 - 2305.74] for air fresheners scented handles
[2303.96 - 2307.36] detergents that have all kinds of
[2305.74 - 2309.28] chemicals in them
[2307.36 - 2311.14] right Chemtrails falling out of the sky
[2309.28 - 2312.64] toxic heavy metals that are in all kinds
[2311.14 - 2315.94] of pharmaceuticals you name it it's not
[2312.64 - 2318.46] supposed to be a filter for that but
[2315.94 - 2321.96] your brain ends up becoming a filter for
[2318.46 - 2321.96] all that stuff and all that chunk
[2325.24 - 2328.48] it should only ever be a filter the
[2327.22 - 2331.24] sense of processing information
[2328.48 - 2335.62] receiving Communications
[2331.24 - 2337.72] Karen asks what book is this one page 50
[2335.62 - 2341.20] of brain saver
[2337.72 - 2345.04] check it out it's for over 40 amazon.com
[2341.20 - 2347.50] us buy both books here what book is aw
[2345.04 - 2348.82] referencing Pamela Miller I'm in brain
[2347.50 - 2352.08] saver
[2348.82 - 2352.08] you guys have the book right
[2354.34 - 2358.20] our brain should only be a filter for
[2356.50 - 2360.40] processing information you guys
[2358.20 - 2362.08] receiving Communications from another
[2360.40 - 2365.28] source or another human being that's
[2362.08 - 2365.28] when our brain becomes a filter
[2365.32 - 2369.76] the brain houses a complex spiritual
[2368.56 - 2372.04] Network
[2369.76 - 2374.26] it also houses a complex physical
[2372.04 - 2376.66] Network
[2374.26 - 2379.84] which requires absolute
[2376.66 - 2382.48] Purity to the highest degree
[2379.84 - 2384.76] it can't be that expired piece of fish
[2382.48 - 2387.16] at the market with the fog glazing over
[2384.76 - 2389.98] its eyes and an odor coming off of it
[2387.16 - 2392.08] because the fish had become a filter for
[2389.98 - 2393.94] a polluted ocean loaded with dioxins
[2392.08 - 2397.84] Mercury nuclear waste petrochemicals and
[2393.94 - 2397.84] sewage filled and pharmaceuticals
[2399.70 - 2404.28] see
[2401.26 - 2409.06] Maria says
[2404.28 - 2410.92] LMAO so laughing my ass off
[2409.06 - 2413.92] obviously
[2410.92 - 2416.58] she says but the fact that he thinks
[2413.92 - 2420.70] that the Spanish Flu really existed
[2416.58 - 2423.22] laughing my ass off makes me think
[2420.70 - 2425.92] you know like why I want to laugh my ass
[2423.22 - 2427.84] off right now whatever wherever you got
[2425.92 - 2429.76] the information that the Spanish Flu
[2427.84 - 2432.46] didn't exist
[2429.76 - 2434.92] makes me laugh my ass off
[2432.46 - 2436.20] because then that means that wherever
[2434.92 - 2439.36] you got that information
[2436.20 - 2440.92] they're not really an intelligent source
[2439.36 - 2442.48] and I guess I shouldn't be laughing my
[2440.92 - 2445.66] ass off I should be
[2442.48 - 2449.26] more like being sad
[2445.66 - 2451.00] and saying that's sad that's sad kind of
[2449.26 - 2452.38] breaks my heart a little bit
[2451.00 - 2454.36] because that means there's a lot of
[2452.38 - 2455.86] people out there it's a lot of stupid
[2454.36 - 2458.92] information
[2455.86 - 2459.70] and you're sitting there laughing at
[2458.92 - 2462.10] like
[2459.70 - 2464.38] incredible Advance information that's
[2462.10 - 2466.30] already saved lives the medical medium
[2464.38 - 2468.22] book series right and you're sitting
[2466.30 - 2469.24] there laughing and that's cool and all
[2468.22 - 2470.62] because I think that's kind of funny
[2469.24 - 2472.18] that you're laughing because anytime
[2470.62 - 2474.10] someone laughs I kind of laugh anyway
[2472.18 - 2477.28] I'm like oh you're laughing at that okay
[2474.10 - 2480.04] but whatever but I can tell you this
[2477.28 - 2482.02] and I'm just just being honest okay
[2480.04 - 2484.78] viruses are alive
[2482.02 - 2487.42] viruses eat classified medical research
[2484.78 - 2490.54] and science raised
[2487.42 - 2492.94] the Spanish Flu they raised that variety
[2490.54 - 2495.22] of influenza in a lab
[2492.94 - 2497.44] and they released it
[2495.22 - 2499.84] and that's why it killed that many
[2497.44 - 2504.04] people on the planet
[2499.84 - 2506.74] it was engineered and it did exist and
[2504.04 - 2509.68] people did die in 1918.
[2506.74 - 2512.38] and it is what it is
[2509.68 - 2514.54] but I get it if you don't believe that I
[2512.38 - 2516.28] hope you stay around anyway hang out
[2514.54 - 2520.54] have some fun
[2516.28 - 2522.04] and we'll still talk cool stuff here
[2520.54 - 2523.78] all right
[2522.04 - 2526.54] but listen I hope you actually learned
[2523.78 - 2529.12] the good information and then
[2526.54 - 2531.46] so you have that
[2529.12 - 2533.44] the brain houses a complex spiritual
[2531.46 - 2535.06] Network it also houses a complex
[2533.44 - 2537.04] physical Network
[2535.06 - 2538.30] I wonder what Dr Nesbitt would say about
[2537.04 - 2540.58] that comment
[2538.30 - 2542.74] which requires absolute Purity to the
[2540.58 - 2545.38] highest degree it can't be that expired
[2542.74 - 2547.42] piece official I was talking about
[2545.38 - 2549.16] I get it to try and discount all the
[2547.42 - 2552.28] people who've lost their lives is really
[2549.16 - 2553.72] sad trying to rewrite histories another
[2552.28 - 2555.16] thing too because what I've seen out
[2553.72 - 2558.46] there is people
[2555.16 - 2560.86] constantly rewrite history
[2558.46 - 2562.54] and then discount all the suffering that
[2560.86 - 2564.52] happened right is that what's going to
[2562.54 - 2566.26] happen now oh my God
[2564.52 - 2567.76] is that where we're going
[2566.26 - 2570.58] all the people with neurological
[2567.76 - 2572.32] symptoms that are like bedridden on
[2570.58 - 2573.64] mattress Island right now you know how
[2572.32 - 2575.50] many people have neurological fatigue
[2573.64 - 2578.20] they can't even function
[2575.50 - 2580.06] there's just like suffering the worst
[2578.20 - 2583.36] Panic the worst anxiety they can't even
[2580.06 - 2586.86] function they're wasting away
[2583.36 - 2586.86] is it all in their head too
[2586.90 - 2591.52] should I be laughing my ass off at them
[2589.54 - 2593.14] is that what I should be doing should I
[2591.52 - 2594.40] laugh my ass off at like all the people
[2593.14 - 2597.42] that are suffering and sick with
[2594.40 - 2597.42] neurological problems
[2598.12 - 2602.80] no
[2599.80 - 2602.80] duh
[2607.60 - 2612.82] all right
[2609.82 - 2616.54] let's move on ready we can't look at her
[2612.82 - 2620.32] brain and know if our brain is going bad
[2616.54 - 2622.36] from cologne perfume
[2620.32 - 2624.64] scented candles air fresheners and toxic
[2622.36 - 2627.04] heavy metals when our brains starts to
[2624.64 - 2630.52] develop problems we don't see a symptom
[2627.04 - 2632.50] or experience a condition quite yet so
[2630.52 - 2634.18] what happens is our brain ends up taking
[2632.50 - 2636.04] all these metals and all these different
[2634.18 - 2637.42] chemicals and all these different toxins
[2636.04 - 2639.40] and all the pharmaceutical pollution
[2637.42 - 2641.74] right our brain takes it all in and
[2639.40 - 2644.86] absorbs it all in you guys but we don't
[2641.74 - 2646.06] really know anything yet we don't know
[2644.86 - 2648.40] anything yet we don't really
[2646.06 - 2650.56] experiencing really anything yet it
[2648.40 - 2652.84] takes time for those cells to really get
[2650.56 - 2654.52] soaked up and get those toxins and
[2652.84 - 2656.50] poison soaked up
[2654.52 - 2659.20] when our brain starts to develop
[2656.50 - 2661.12] problems we don't see a symptom or
[2659.20 - 2663.46] experience a condition quite yet we
[2661.12 - 2665.44] can't open our skull
[2663.46 - 2667.42] like an egg
[2665.44 - 2669.52] take a look inside
[2667.42 - 2671.32] and take a sniff to find out if it's
[2669.52 - 2674.04] gone rotten like a piece of fish has
[2671.32 - 2674.04] gone rotten
[2674.44 - 2679.18] can't use visual clues or our sense of
[2678.04 - 2682.18] smell
[2679.18 - 2684.58] like we can with that egg or a piece of
[2682.18 - 2686.50] fish that rotten egg to determine if our
[2684.58 - 2688.24] brain is getting toxic or dirty you
[2686.50 - 2690.88] can't crack somebody's head open like an
[2688.24 - 2692.68] egg sniff it and be like oh it's rotten
[2690.88 - 2694.96] in there
[2692.68 - 2697.30] only when we start to develop symptoms
[2694.96 - 2699.28] from a brain that's been suffering for
[2697.30 - 2700.90] weeks or months or years do we start to
[2699.28 - 2703.12] get a clue about what's going on inside
[2700.90 - 2705.82] but I got a message for the person who
[2703.12 - 2708.46] was talking about the Spanish Flu always
[2705.82 - 2711.22] remember okay and this is just
[2708.46 - 2712.72] being honest and I'm trying to listen to
[2711.22 - 2714.16] Spirit of compassion because he said to
[2712.72 - 2715.48] me
[2714.16 - 2719.86] he said
[2715.48 - 2723.40] be nice aw don't get sarcastic
[2719.86 - 2724.48] don't get defensive and stick up for the
[2723.40 - 2727.24] information
[2724.48 - 2731.04] Spirit of compassion said just tell her
[2727.24 - 2731.04] if she gets really sick down the road
[2731.08 - 2734.80] take the medical medium books to your
[2732.88 - 2736.12] doctor or practitioner have them help
[2734.80 - 2738.52] you through it
[2736.12 - 2741.78] but the information is for
[2738.52 - 2741.78] that person down the road
[2746.14 - 2749.82] so let's keep on going a little bit
[2752.80 - 2758.50] Kimberly Kobe says which juicer is best
[2755.46 - 2761.50] all-around celery at all
[2758.50 - 2761.50] hmm
[2765.15 - 2775.69] [Music]
[2783.76 - 2788.20] the mm-1500 which does a whole bunch of
[2787.12 - 2790.60] stuff
[2788.20 - 2792.88] I talked all about it and the mm-900
[2790.60 - 2794.44] which is an incredible juicer and it
[2792.88 - 2796.66] saves money
[2794.44 - 2800.82] you guys know the whole thing it saves
[2796.66 - 2800.82] money for real incredible juicers
[2801.34 - 2806.80] but it has to be the mm-1500 or the
[2803.32 - 2808.30] mm-900 can't be just any juicer and you
[2806.80 - 2810.22] will be surprised it'll be so great
[2808.30 - 2812.56] you'll save money in the whole bit I
[2810.22 - 2814.84] endorse them and just told you guys all
[2812.56 - 2817.50] about them and everything
[2814.84 - 2817.50] all right
[2818.86 - 2824.08] what's he talking about celery juice
[2821.38 - 2825.82] okay let's go no but I appreciate you
[2824.08 - 2827.62] asking that anyway and I'm not making
[2825.82 - 2829.66] fun of you on any level it's just that I
[2827.62 - 2830.74] always tell you guys I always get
[2829.66 - 2833.20] punished
[2830.74 - 2835.24] for when I bring out the juicer a whole
[2833.20 - 2837.76] bunch of people attack me and say there
[2835.24 - 2839.56] he is with his juicer it's like oh my
[2837.76 - 2841.60] God it's like they can't tell you how
[2839.56 - 2843.82] many people DM and everything else and
[2841.60 - 2846.46] ask like where's the best juicer or how
[2843.82 - 2848.80] do I juice celery where's the juicer
[2846.46 - 2850.54] sale like I get asked it 100 times and
[2848.80 - 2853.66] then I go like three four months without
[2850.54 - 2856.12] even mentioning the juicer and then
[2853.66 - 2857.68] the community buys a juicer that doesn't
[2856.12 - 2859.18] save the money out there and they're
[2857.68 - 2860.56] spending all this money on produce and
[2859.18 - 2862.36] going broke and it's the saddest thing
[2860.56 - 2864.22] I've ever seen so now I have to talk
[2862.36 - 2867.30] about it more in order to make sure if
[2864.22 - 2867.30] people don't get ripped off
[2867.58 - 2870.94] all right
[2869.68 - 2872.38] see guys we're talking about some really
[2870.94 - 2875.16] cool information right here I'm really
[2872.38 - 2875.16] excited about this
[2875.80 - 2880.42] Jennifer Leonard says it's okay aw
[2878.32 - 2881.98] remember there's a lot of people still
[2880.42 - 2883.60] hearing about you for the first time
[2881.98 - 2886.30] you're right Jennifer you're right
[2883.60 - 2887.80] you're right and that is so cool and
[2886.30 - 2889.00] you're on Facebook that is so cool to
[2887.80 - 2892.00] say because I'm going to tell you right
[2889.00 - 2894.16] now that why that's so cool because
[2892.00 - 2896.38] that's why I repeat myself
[2894.16 - 2898.90] that's why I repeat myself
[2896.38 - 2900.70] so many people punish me for re they
[2898.90 - 2904.24] scold me and scold me for repeating
[2900.70 - 2906.10] myself and and the reason why I do that
[2904.24 - 2908.28] is because of the new people coming on
[2906.10 - 2908.28] board
[2910.60 - 2914.38] only when we start to develop symptoms
[2912.40 - 2916.30] from a brain that's been suffering for
[2914.38 - 2917.86] weeks or months or years do we start to
[2916.30 - 2920.14] get a clue about what's going on inside
[2917.86 - 2922.48] and the clue you guys is not in medical
[2920.14 - 2923.98] research and science I have not seen it
[2922.48 - 2925.54] so many people suffering with symptoms
[2923.98 - 2928.12] conditions and they still don't know
[2925.54 - 2930.22] what's going inside the brain the brain
[2928.12 - 2932.74] saver books are actually able to clear
[2930.22 - 2934.00] that up which is really important and do
[2932.74 - 2935.56] you have the brain Jennifer do you have
[2934.00 - 2938.28] the brain saver books
[2935.56 - 2938.28] right here
[2938.62 - 2942.58] if you don't have the 26 dollars because
[2940.42 - 2944.56] they're over 40 off on Amazon go to the
[2942.58 - 2945.88] library and get them for free everybody
[2944.56 - 2948.70] if you go to the library and get them
[2945.88 - 2950.50] for free I used to go to I haven't this
[2948.70 - 2954.04] year been able to do this but I used to
[2950.50 - 2956.14] load up a van and I used to drop books
[2954.04 - 2958.36] off at libraries and then I would go
[2956.14 - 2960.64] literally in different counties and then
[2958.36 - 2962.62] in different states and I would do that
[2960.64 - 2964.78] it was just exhausting and really hard
[2962.62 - 2966.46] to do but go to your library ask for the
[2964.78 - 2968.56] book
[2966.46 - 2970.72] and try to get the book as you know from
[2968.56 - 2973.66] the previous chapters the electricity of
[2970.72 - 2976.06] your brain is meant to be clean
[2973.66 - 2978.22] your electrical Grid in your brain
[2976.06 - 2980.14] you've got a wine glass in front of the
[2978.22 - 2982.18] brain here
[2980.14 - 2985.02] your electrical Grid in your brain is
[2982.18 - 2985.02] meant to be clean
[2986.02 - 2990.28] the fluid of your brain
[2988.24 - 2992.74] right the spinal fluid is meant to be
[2990.28 - 2995.20] clean the blood in your brain is meant
[2992.74 - 2998.20] to be clean you guys on page 51 and so
[2995.20 - 3000.48] your liver your brain's best friend is
[2998.20 - 3002.46] working overtime to keep poisons out of
[3000.48 - 3005.64] your brain so your brain doesn't have to
[3002.46 - 3007.98] become the filter and yet life here on
[3005.64 - 3010.08] planet Earth doesn't work so ideally
[3007.98 - 3011.64] because our livers get so overloaded
[3010.08 - 3013.56] like I was telling you before our brains
[3011.64 - 3016.04] get saturated with poisons from all the
[3013.56 - 3018.36] areas and angles including prescription
[3016.04 - 3019.56] Pharmaceuticals that are supposedly for
[3018.36 - 3020.78] the brain
[3019.56 - 3022.86] foreign
[3020.78 - 3024.72] toxic heavy metals preservatives
[3022.86 - 3027.06] chemicals caffeine and more that you'll
[3024.72 - 3029.46] read about in these books
[3027.06 - 3031.14] the brain is meant to be a sponge for
[3029.46 - 3034.26] knowledge
[3031.14 - 3038.10] so your brain is meant to be that sponge
[3034.26 - 3042.50] for information and knowledge
[3038.10 - 3042.50] instead it becomes a sponge for waste
[3043.86 - 3047.46] as blood is pumped to the brain it is
[3046.08 - 3049.62] blood that's filled with many different
[3047.46 - 3052.20] toxins
[3049.62 - 3054.18] the publicly known medical field doesn't
[3052.20 - 3056.28] want any part in knowing this because
[3054.18 - 3058.08] the last thing it needs is to learn
[3056.28 - 3060.30] about the poisons that enter our brains
[3058.08 - 3063.30] as you know that if the publicly known
[3060.30 - 3064.02] medical research and Science World finds
[3063.30 - 3065.94] out
[3064.02 - 3069.48] they learn
[3065.94 - 3073.22] what's poisoning our brains
[3069.48 - 3073.22] that's a little crazy and a little scary
[3073.38 - 3077.46] because if they learn that
[3075.48 - 3079.38] they have to shut up they don't want to
[3077.46 - 3081.60] learn that because they can't speak out
[3079.38 - 3084.24] if they ever learn that that would
[3081.60 - 3085.74] expose the crimes the neglect and the
[3084.24 - 3087.96] agendas of the classified medical
[3085.74 - 3091.34] industry and maybe even the wizard that
[3087.96 - 3091.34] puppeteers it all
[3091.80 - 3095.82] that's incredible
[3093.66 - 3098.16] notably some of the poisons that get
[3095.82 - 3100.02] through to the brain are viral toxins is
[3098.16 - 3102.60] which why so many people are sick
[3100.02 - 3104.94] they're sick to death of being sick and
[3102.60 - 3108.00] they're sick
[3104.94 - 3109.02] viral toxins including viral neurotoxins
[3108.00 - 3111.24] remember I was talking about that
[3109.02 - 3112.98] earlier viral neurotoxins from the virus
[3111.24 - 3115.56] eating so what I was trying to tell you
[3112.98 - 3119.78] guys is I'll make it really
[3115.56 - 3119.78] easy breezy almost drop my egg
[3122.64 - 3126.12] okay
[3124.32 - 3128.28] the virus
[3126.12 - 3130.20] inside people's bodies or viruses
[3128.28 - 3132.84] whether it's Epstein bars herpes simplex
[3130.20 - 3134.82] one herpes simplex 2 hhv6 shingles virus
[3132.84 - 3136.86] hhv7
[3134.82 - 3140.04] whether whatever varieties and strains
[3136.86 - 3142.86] of them loves to feed on the food it
[3140.04 - 3145.68] releases a neurotoxin that neurotoxin
[3142.86 - 3146.58] goes to the brain short circuits the
[3145.68 - 3148.80] brain
[3146.58 - 3152.18] and makes it so we suffer and struggle
[3148.80 - 3152.18] with symptoms and conditions
[3154.86 - 3157.44] anybody want to have a couple eggs with
[3156.42 - 3159.12] me later
[3157.44 - 3160.50] crack them open or fry them up how do
[3159.12 - 3163.02] you like your eggs
[3160.50 - 3165.72] scrambled fried
[3163.02 - 3169.16] poached
[3165.72 - 3169.16] I'll make some eggs for everybody
[3169.86 - 3173.58] the new people here will be like oh my
[3171.96 - 3175.98] God he loves eggs this is the place to
[3173.58 - 3178.50] be incredible
[3175.98 - 3180.86] Egg party
[3178.50 - 3180.86] okay
[3183.36 - 3186.96] the virus is giving off these toxins
[3185.34 - 3189.18] usually come from elsewhere in the body
[3186.96 - 3190.74] they may reside in the liver lymphatic
[3189.18 - 3192.84] system spleen intestinal tract
[3190.74 - 3195.72] reproductive system nervous system and
[3192.84 - 3198.00] even the skeletal skeletal system
[3195.72 - 3199.44] I gotta learn to read better you guys
[3198.00 - 3201.78] have you checked out medical meme
[3199.44 - 3204.12] podcasts at Apple podcast I did swelling
[3201.78 - 3206.58] episode have you heard it have you heard
[3204.12 - 3207.90] the aliens podcast episode have you
[3206.58 - 3209.40] heard all the different episodes of
[3207.90 - 3212.36] medical meme podcast at Apple podcast
[3209.40 - 3216.90] check it out when you get a chance
[3212.36 - 3219.36] viruses can even Nest inside bone marrow
[3216.90 - 3220.56] viruses can Nest inside somebody's bone
[3219.36 - 3222.54] marrow
[3220.56 - 3225.12] where many toxic heavy metals such as
[3222.54 - 3227.70] mercury reside and settle this is one of
[3225.12 - 3229.62] the foundations of blood cell and bone
[3227.70 - 3232.08] marrow disease
[3229.62 - 3234.24] mainly the viruses reside in the liver
[3232.08 - 3237.00] though but they do end up in the bones
[3234.24 - 3238.92] too for so many people
[3237.00 - 3241.08] this is cool right here you guys check
[3238.92 - 3243.30] it out as I mentioned earlier these
[3241.08 - 3245.70] herpetic viruses range from Epstein-Barr
[3243.30 - 3248.42] virus I was known as the Epstein-Barr
[3245.70 - 3250.38] guy I was
[3248.42 - 3252.42] ostracized and made fun of and
[3250.38 - 3254.40] discriminated discriminated against
[3252.42 - 3258.30] because I was known as the Epstein-Barr
[3254.40 - 3259.98] guy and then years and years later
[3258.30 - 3260.78] people are using the Epstein-Barr
[3259.98 - 3264.02] information
[3260.78 - 3264.02] what happened
[3264.30 - 3268.02] they range from Epstein-Barr virus and
[3266.04 - 3269.28] it's over 60 varieties to shingles and
[3268.02 - 3271.74] it's over 30 varieties of
[3269.28 - 3274.98] cytomegalovirus what
[3271.74 - 3279.00] CMV and it's many varieties to multiple
[3274.98 - 3280.80] varieties of human herpes 6 hhv6 to well
[3279.00 - 3284.10] over a dozen varieties of herpes simplex
[3280.80 - 3286.14] and a hundreds of the hhv varieties and
[3284.10 - 3287.88] mutations most of which are undiscovered
[3286.14 - 3288.72] by publicly known medical research and
[3287.88 - 3292.86] science
[3288.72 - 3296.76] classified medical research and science
[3292.86 - 3298.62] let the viruses out of the running gate
[3296.76 - 3299.52] publicly known medical research and
[3298.62 - 3301.80] science
[3299.52 - 3305.76] stumble across certain varieties of
[3301.80 - 3308.72] viruses by chance like the Epstein-Barr

[3483.30 - 3487.80] blueberry drinks challenge reading out a
[3485.52 - 3489.30] brain saver right now
[3487.80 - 3492.84] I just want to read a couple more
[3489.30 - 3495.60] sentences check this out neurotoxins 101
[3492.84 - 3499.08] so what are neurotoxins neurotoxins are
[3495.60 - 3502.80] a thing produced it's a toxic waste
[3499.08 - 3503.94] produced by viruses released in our
[3502.80 - 3507.78] bloodstream and throughout our body
[3503.94 - 3511.26] these neurotoxins land on phrenic nerves
[3507.78 - 3514.56] they land on vagus nerves
[3511.26 - 3517.02] they land on trigeminal nerves
[3514.56 - 3519.42] have a glossal nerves
[3517.02 - 3521.76] they land on all our different nerves
[3519.42 - 3523.50] cranial nerves and they give us all
[3521.76 - 3525.24] these mystery symptoms that can make us
[3523.50 - 3528.06] feel like we're crazy
[3525.24 - 3530.34] and make us really sick they could also
[3528.06 - 3533.22] saturate the brain making us feel like
[3530.34 - 3536.10] we have this fatigue where our legs feel
[3533.22 - 3538.50] like lead and our arms feel like lead
[3536.10 - 3540.42] so that's what neurotoxins can do and
[3538.50 - 3543.00] they're produced from viruses like
[3540.42 - 3545.58] Epstein-Barr virus hhv6 said
[3543.00 - 3548.58] omegalovirus they're produced by viruses
[3545.58 - 3549.96] the most common neurotoxins culprits
[3548.58 - 3551.46] come from your garden variety
[3549.96 - 3554.58] Epstein-Barr which everybody has
[3551.46 - 3556.98] shingles everyone at this point in time
[3554.58 - 3558.44] has at least one form of Epstein-Barr
[3556.98 - 3560.64] and shingles living inside their body
[3558.44 - 3562.80] these viruses can produce large
[3560.64 - 3564.60] quantities of neurotoxins giving people
[3562.80 - 3566.58] so many symptoms and conditions it's
[3564.60 - 3569.40] incredible
[3566.58 - 3572.28] and then because of that people end up
[3569.40 - 3575.40] having so many problems but we need to
[3572.28 - 3576.72] learn how to fix it how to get our
[3575.40 - 3579.06] symptoms better
[3576.72 - 3580.98] we need to learn what to do how to clean
[3579.06 - 3582.90] up the neurotoxins how to kill off the
[3580.98 - 3585.06] viruses how to beat them down how to
[3582.90 - 3587.22] beat them how to clean up how to restore
[3585.06 - 3588.96] our central nervous system how to make
[3587.22 - 3590.46] ourselves stronger how to make our
[3588.96 - 3592.62] immune system stronger all these things
[3590.46 - 3594.60] matter you guys this has been incredible
