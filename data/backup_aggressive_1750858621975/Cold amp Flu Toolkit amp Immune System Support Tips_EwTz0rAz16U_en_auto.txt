[191.28 - 196.14] talking about cold and flu season and
[194.22 - 197.40] it's not you know I know I was kidding
[196.14 - 199.74] around and I was caught I was fake
[197.40 - 202.14] coughing but it's not a joke I mean I've
[199.74 - 205.86] seen the flu knock people on their butt
[202.14 - 207.48] like knock people on their butt I mean
[205.86 - 209.52] it's not just the phlegm it's not just
[207.48 - 211.44] the mucus but it's also the cough
[209.52 - 213.66] involved where they're coughing all
[211.44 - 215.70] night they're having coughing attacks in
[213.66 - 217.44] the morning they got the fevers they
[215.70 - 219.66] don't feel well you got the runny nose
[217.44 - 223.14] the sniffles your body aches everything
[219.66 - 225.12] it's all in the above right and
[223.14 - 227.40] if you're already dealing with something
[225.12 - 229.74] if you're already compromised in some
[227.40 - 232.50] way with your health somehow some way
[229.74 - 234.96] compromised it doesn't make things
[232.50 - 237.36] easier that's the hard part right there
[234.96 - 239.88] so what I see out there
[237.36 - 241.20] as people they're struggling with some
[239.88 - 242.40] kind of chronic condition or chronic
[241.20 - 244.08] illness they got all these different
[242.40 - 246.24] symptoms and then they get whacked with
[244.08 - 249.42] the flu and then boom you know they're
[246.24 - 251.04] hit so hard another thing too is a lot
[249.42 - 251.70] of people have a lot of things inside of
[251.04 - 253.26] them
[251.70 - 254.22] they'll have like the Epstein bars
[253.26 - 255.42] they'll have all these other different
[254.22 - 257.10] conditions they'll have all these
[255.42 - 258.12] different bugs and pathogens in them and
[257.10 - 261.12] I'll have all these other different
[258.12 - 264.36] things and then the flu comes along and
[261.12 - 265.86] it just hits you and then you're in it a
[264.36 - 268.26] lot of people I've seen this and then
[265.86 - 270.60] you can't come out of it it's too hard
[268.26 - 273.18] to come out of it's like the flu that
[270.60 - 275.34] lasts for months long flu and it just
[273.18 - 276.72] lasts and lasts I talked about this for
[275.34 - 279.12] years you guys know I've talked about
[276.72 - 281.82] this for years right so
[279.12 - 284.34] I don't like cold and flu season I don't
[281.82 - 285.84] like cold and flu in general because if
[284.34 - 287.94] it's not the stomach flu then it's
[285.84 - 289.20] another flu and it's another one so I
[287.94 - 290.76] don't like it in general because it's
[289.20 - 293.94] around all the time and it really hits
[290.76 - 295.56] people but what I wanted to do because I
[293.94 - 297.96] want to offer as much free information
[295.56 - 300.00] as possible now check this out you can
[297.96 - 302.82] go to medicalmium.com there's no pay
[300.00 - 305.88] wall you don't have to pay for this is
[302.82 - 308.34] it it isn't a pay scheme that's the
[305.88 - 310.38] thing like the pay the Ponzi schemes the
[308.34 - 313.20] pay schemes all that stuff that's out
[310.38 - 316.44] there that's crazy it's not that it's
[313.20 - 318.96] free if that's what it is but it wasn't
[316.44 - 322.68] free to put together that's the whole
[318.96 - 326.16] point okay it took money to put together
[322.68 - 328.80] it took medical medium money to put it
[326.16 - 331.56] together medical medium take money out
[328.80 - 334.32] of his pockets okay he had to take money
[331.56 - 336.54] out of his pockets and he had a he has
[334.32 - 339.66] to have his team working and he has to
[336.54 - 341.88] pay his team okay a lot of money
[339.66 - 343.26] and then they helped to put it all
[341.88 - 347.28] together with me
[343.26 - 349.62] so I pay to do everything but yeah it's
[347.28 - 352.74] all free for everybody else that's how
[349.62 - 355.92] it's done here because I am at your
[352.74 - 358.80] service is what I am that's your service
[355.92 - 360.42] of course so anyway
[358.80 - 362.04] all right you guys let's go let's get
[360.42 - 364.80] into it we'll talk about can I put my
[362.04 - 367.68] pockets back in my pants please
[364.80 - 370.98] I don't think we need to do that
[367.68 - 373.50] so Kim Miller says Anthony's got the 80s
[370.98 - 375.30] flare with the popped up collar yes the
[373.50 - 378.18] pop-up collar is not working good today
[375.30 - 379.98] one of the colors is over here is not
[378.18 - 383.04] popped up enough
[379.98 - 384.36] I've asked just my life anyway so I want
[383.04 - 386.16] to talk about this because this
[384.36 - 389.28] information that's really important cold
[386.16 - 392.34] and flu coming around keep the immune
[389.28 - 395.70] system strong Diane Eva says ew has a
[392.34 - 397.86] new hat yes I do indeed I like hats I
[395.70 - 400.44] like baseball caps it's so easy you
[397.86 - 403.50] throw it on you don't have to comb your
[400.44 - 406.20] hair you don't have to do anything and I
[403.50 - 408.84] have curly hair curly hair does not comb
[406.20 - 410.94] right so it's a pain in the butt so boom
[408.84 - 412.38] I throw the hat on and I'm happy and it
[410.94 - 414.96] takes two seconds
[412.38 - 415.92] because I'm already busy enough as it is
[414.96 - 418.38] anyway
[415.92 - 423.36] I know it's a lazy approach when I do
[418.38 - 424.80] that but whatever but you guys all right
[423.36 - 426.54] it's important to keep our immune system
[424.80 - 429.06] strong during this type of time of year
[426.54 - 432.24] especially when we're extra stressed
[429.06 - 436.68] family holidays extra stress everything
[432.24 - 438.90] involved weather changes all of it so it
[436.68 - 440.82] is very important so let's talk about
[438.90 - 441.70] the zinc a little bit I'm gonna take a
[440.82 - 444.12] little zinc
[441.70 - 446.34] [Music]
[444.12 - 449.16] I have a glass to take it but I am going
[446.34 - 451.02] to try to get a shot glass in a minute
[449.16 - 453.36] so anyway this is the Imaging products
[451.02 - 454.56] right you guys know it's I'm going to
[453.36 - 456.84] tell you right now
[454.56 - 458.40] hands down there's no company doing what
[456.84 - 460.08] vimergy does
[458.40 - 461.46] there's no company out there doing what
[460.08 - 463.44] the Emoji does
[461.46 - 465.84] it doesn't exist out there
[463.44 - 468.12] it's an honor and a privilege to be able
[465.84 - 470.64] to be in this world right now
[468.12 - 473.40] while something is created that's
[470.64 - 477.18] finally really clean it's just it's so
[473.40 - 479.04] important and um got my shot glass right
[477.18 - 483.30] there don't throw glasses in the air
[479.04 - 485.64] whatever you do that was a bad idea so
[483.30 - 488.16] with a zinc's a great one for the immune
[485.64 - 489.84] system that's critical I talk about zinc
[488.16 - 492.36] All Through The Years good zinc
[489.84 - 495.42] information in the books right all of
[492.36 - 497.46] that and then you guys know about
[495.42 - 499.50] um other stuff would sing too of medical
[497.46 - 501.72] meme information but anyway two proper
[499.50 - 505.46] folds is what I like right there of the
[501.72 - 505.46] zinc and I am going to take some now
[506.04 - 513.18] Sports the immune system which is really
[508.86 - 515.82] important supports antioxidant
[513.18 - 519.24] Ellis tasty world says love Emoji so
[515.82 - 520.98] much amazing so
[519.24 - 522.12] I'm gonna get some water let me use this
[520.98 - 525.00] here
[522.12 - 527.36] we go I got some zinc in here in the
[525.00 - 527.36] shot glass
[528.30 - 532.02] so I want to talk to you guys you guys
[529.86 - 534.84] know I I work with vimrozie now I fully
[532.02 - 536.34] endorse them and it's because I don't
[534.84 - 540.78] want this stuff to disappear I get
[536.34 - 543.48] scared really scared if something's so
[540.78 - 546.48] good is done so right
[543.48 - 549.96] and then it disappears or something
[546.48 - 553.08] happens so like I feel like my job is to
[549.96 - 555.48] keep things like resources here that
[553.08 - 557.76] like that are just unbelievable I feel
[555.48 - 559.74] like that's a big part of my job right
[557.76 - 562.50] now so if he says is energy going to
[559.74 - 565.02] have a Black Friday sale yes it's
[562.50 - 568.02] starting today their Black Friday sale
[565.02 - 570.84] is starting today so check them out
[568.02 - 573.30] vimorgy.com these invictor I am is Mary
[570.84 - 576.60] e r g y
[573.30 - 577.98] so what I love about the products is
[576.60 - 580.14] four things I'll give you the four
[577.98 - 581.70] things really quick they don't have any
[580.14 - 584.16] hidden things that they're not
[581.70 - 587.88] disclosing okay
[584.16 - 589.80] so label requirements allow companies to
[587.88 - 592.32] hide a certain percentage inside their
[589.80 - 594.12] supplements a small certain percentage
[592.32 - 596.58] that you don't know about that's in the
[594.12 - 598.02] supplements of imagery says no we're not
[596.58 - 600.36] going to do that it's not going to
[598.02 - 602.88] happen and that's a big deal all on its
[600.36 - 605.16] own you can't find that anywhere in my
[602.88 - 606.60] opinion it does not exist I've asked all
[605.16 - 608.52] the supplement companies out there that
[606.60 - 609.96] I could talk to and find I've looked
[608.52 - 611.58] into so much over the years and it
[609.96 - 613.40] doesn't happen the other thing is
[611.58 - 617.22] Bemidji products are third party
[613.40 - 619.98] independently tested boom I'm telling
[617.22 - 623.46] you that means so much another thing too
[619.98 - 626.46] they don't have the natural flavors
[623.46 - 628.02] they don't have the maltodextrin they
[626.46 - 629.94] don't have the alcohol they don't have
[628.02 - 630.96] the vinegar the alcohol is a big one
[629.94 - 631.80] right now I'm going to tell you right
[630.96 - 635.34] now
[631.80 - 636.90] alcohol in supplementation like for
[635.34 - 639.12] instance the propolis doesn't have the
[636.90 - 641.70] propylene glycol
[639.12 - 645.54] the propolis doesn't have the propylene
[641.70 - 647.16] glycol in it that's critical and even
[645.54 - 650.28] when there's propolis out there they'll
[647.16 - 652.26] say oh alcohol free it doesn't work that
[650.28 - 653.94] way so it's another reason why I love
[652.26 - 656.70] the Bemidji products because there's no
[653.94 - 659.34] it's not just about no soy it's not just
[656.70 - 660.72] about no gluten it's about no vinegar no
[659.34 - 662.82] caffeine no natural flavors no
[660.72 - 666.60] artificial flavors no titanium dioxide
[662.82 - 669.54] no alcohol no citric acid huge one no
[666.60 - 672.36] maltodextrin huge one it's about all of
[669.54 - 673.74] that and then it's about not hiding
[672.36 - 675.30] something in there they're not
[673.74 - 677.28] disclosing
[675.30 - 680.52] boom it's incredible when I think about
[677.28 - 681.66] it and then the quality aspect right so
[680.52 - 683.10] because you know we're talking about
[681.66 - 684.36] cold and flu if you guys just got on
[683.10 - 686.82] here we're talking about cold and flu
[684.36 - 688.50] support immune system all that's cold
[686.82 - 691.32] and flu season I'm talking about why I
[688.50 - 693.84] support memory so Alicia says my family
[691.32 - 695.52] has dodged the crazy illnesses flying
[693.84 - 697.26] around my daughter's school I'm so
[695.52 - 699.84] grateful for zinc shock therapy and
[697.26 - 701.70] vitamin C shock therapy we're healthier
[699.84 - 705.30] than we've been in years and I'm gonna
[701.70 - 706.74] do a little vitamin C shock therapy in a
[705.30 - 708.96] couple of minutes too that's incredible
[706.74 - 712.74] and
[708.96 - 714.36] so the quality aspect see if you take a
[712.74 - 715.80] bunch of money it's just going to be
[714.36 - 717.72] straight up and no one talks about this
[715.80 - 721.62] no one so what you're hearing right now
[717.72 - 722.70] no one talks about okay if you take a
[721.62 - 725.22] bunch of money
[722.70 - 726.72] like a whole ton of money right or
[725.22 - 728.22] whatever and you want to start your
[726.72 - 730.32] supplement company
[728.22 - 732.72] you take a bunch of money
[730.32 - 735.48] you're gonna go to a manufacturer
[732.72 - 738.30] somewhere that manufacturer is going to
[735.48 - 739.80] give you their bottom of the barrel
[738.30 - 742.20] product
[739.80 - 743.46] your your ingredients and you're going
[742.20 - 745.38] to be like well is this quality and
[743.46 - 747.36] they're like oh yeah it's quality and
[745.38 - 751.02] you're like okay cool let me just pay
[747.36 - 753.42] for it and the price point right oh
[751.02 - 755.76] that's the best one to get sure I'll get
[753.42 - 758.88] it but it's not the best when no one
[755.76 - 762.06] talks about is supplement companies by
[758.88 - 765.24] the lower quality so they can charge
[762.06 - 766.86] more and then make a bigger profit do
[765.24 - 771.18] you see how it works
[766.86 - 774.86] you buy the lower quality ingredient so
[771.18 - 777.24] you can charge more and make more right
[774.86 - 779.70] it's all business
[777.24 - 781.50] and that's what it is the reason why I
[779.70 - 783.24] endorsed these guys fully wholeheartedly
[781.50 - 784.68] and I want this stuff to stay around I
[783.24 - 787.14] want it to be here because it's not
[784.68 - 789.12] about business it's about people it's
[787.14 - 791.76] about people
[789.12 - 794.58] and that's the key and quality really
[791.76 - 796.26] matters when it's real it makes the
[794.58 - 797.82] difference
[796.26 - 799.32] so I'm just I'm gonna say I'm talking
[797.82 - 802.20] about something people don't talk about
[799.32 - 803.88] you guys like this is not not allowed to
[802.20 - 806.76] be talked about out there it's like one
[803.88 - 809.46] of the secrets so if you start
[806.76 - 810.72] a supplement company you go to a
[809.46 - 814.56] manufacturer
[810.72 - 817.32] and you buy the low quality stuff so you
[814.56 - 819.72] can make a lot of money right
[817.32 - 822.96] they don't do that they buy the highest
[819.72 - 824.82] they can find that's possible the
[822.96 - 826.44] highest and best quality that they can
[824.82 - 829.80] find that's possible and they don't care
[826.44 - 832.50] about the price point the reason why is
[829.80 - 834.12] because this mom-and-pop company cares
[832.50 - 836.88] about the person
[834.12 - 838.14] taking it and that I've never seen
[836.88 - 840.54] before
[838.14 - 843.00] I have to talk about it I gotta because
[840.54 - 844.80] I've never seen it before the energy is
[843.00 - 846.42] so good for the body and so Milda says
[844.80 - 847.98] so you guys were talking about cold and
[846.42 - 849.54] flu I've got the memory supplements in
[847.98 - 852.12] front of me because that's what I take
[849.54 - 853.80] to keep my immune system Strong saying
[852.12 - 855.72] Sue says when I got the Critter last
[853.80 - 857.40] month on top of bronchitis by the way
[855.72 - 859.02] I'm sorry that happened to you when I
[857.40 - 861.54] got the Critter last month on top of
[859.02 - 864.12] bronchitis and strep throat uh 100
[861.54 - 866.82] believe the Bemidji supplements saved my
[864.12 - 869.16] life I know if I would have gotten it
[866.82 - 870.84] without all the medical medium tools I'd
[869.16 - 872.94] be dead
[870.84 - 874.20] it's incredible I'm so glad you're here
[872.94 - 877.56] truly
[874.20 - 880.02] and so that's why I'm talking about them
[877.56 - 882.06] right now because it's what I take to
[880.02 - 884.52] keep my immune system strong it's what I
[882.06 - 886.98] recommend my friends and my family if
[884.52 - 889.20] they have a flu or a cold it's what I
[886.98 - 890.94] recommend doctors that talk to me all
[889.20 - 893.28] the time
[890.94 - 895.98] so incredible Maria says the zinc shock
[893.28 - 898.02] therapy has worked for me too I love the

[907.62 - 911.88] even that just came from above it just

[928.08 - 933.60] reasons why I support the company
[930.60 - 936.30] and I mean I want to shout it from the
[933.60 - 937.74] rooftops I want to like scream it from
[936.30 - 940.62] the rooftops
[937.74 - 942.06] because it doesn't exist out there and
[940.62 - 944.34] it's like when you even think about it
[942.06 - 946.20] it's crazy Allison Sandra says the
[944.34 - 948.00] pathogen exposure shot vitamin C and
[946.20 - 951.32] Zinc shock therapy just saved me from
[948.00 - 955.50] getting sick a few days ago a few
[951.32 - 957.84] amazing amazing Kim Miller says memories
[955.50 - 960.54] Angelic that's how I feel
[957.84 - 962.58] I feel it's Angelic and so what happens
[960.54 - 964.68] out there so check this out
[962.58 - 966.78] it's like like if you guys got a second
[964.68 - 968.64] like this is this is what it this is
[966.78 - 969.90] what I tell my friends my friends want
[968.64 - 971.88] to talk to me or something and they want
[969.90 - 975.54] to hang out with me this is what I tell
[971.88 - 976.98] them I tell them look if you start a
[975.54 - 979.20] supplement company
[976.98 - 980.70] you go to a manufacturer and you get the
[979.20 - 983.94] ingredients
[980.70 - 985.98] but everybody who does that they choose
[983.94 - 987.72] the cheaper a lot of ingredients that
[985.98 - 988.50] the manufacturer puts all together for
[987.72 - 992.28] them
[988.50 - 995.46] so they can make it's about the money
[992.28 - 997.86] and memory doesn't do that
[995.46 - 999.42] it's like what the
[997.86 - 1002.66] crazy
[999.42 - 1006.08] so reg lean says my mom used vitamin C
[1002.66 - 1008.84] shock and cured her cold sore and sore

[1027.38 - 1031.40] missed days of work because I'm not
[1029.42 - 1034.64] getting sick anymore the investment in
[1031.40 - 1037.40] the supplements is a no-brainer I see
[1034.64 - 1039.62] people go out and they go into Whole
[1037.40 - 1040.82] Foods and they go into all the different
[1039.62 - 1042.98] stores

[1134.84 - 1138.74] I'm excited
[1136.70 - 1140.30] and I wasn't making fun of anybody when
[1138.74 - 1142.52] I was coughing my brains out at the
[1140.30 - 1144.50] beginning of the show I wasn't at all I
[1142.52 - 1147.40] was just saying you don't want to have
[1144.50 - 1147.40] to go through that
[1147.98 - 1151.04] everybody goes through it it's such a
[1149.66 - 1154.64] bummer
[1151.04 - 1157.76] out there I'm putting some honey in here
[1154.64 - 1160.10] now this product is really
[1157.76 - 1162.02] high in antioxidants because it's
[1160.10 - 1163.46] vitamin C
[1162.02 - 1165.86] all right
[1163.46 - 1169.22] I'm going to cut an orange
[1165.86 - 1171.02] so what I have right here is the micro C
[1169.22 - 1173.84] if you don't know about vimergy V is in
[1171.02 - 1176.24] Victor i m e r g y.com
[1173.84 - 1178.58] I'm going to put two capsules of micro C
[1176.24 - 1179.96] in here
[1178.58 - 1182.42] smell
[1179.96 - 1184.40] moving the needle that's what I like I
[1182.42 - 1187.34] like everything that moves the needle
[1184.40 - 1188.72] that's what mm info so I'm making the
[1187.34 - 1191.42] medical medium
[1188.72 - 1194.30] vitamin C shock therapy is what I'm
[1191.42 - 1197.24] making I put two capsules
[1194.30 - 1201.58] right there I put a little bit of honey
[1197.24 - 1201.58] now let's cut an orange open
[1201.76 - 1211.12] now Spirit of compassion created
[1206.78 - 1211.12] this vitamin C shock therapy
[1211.16 - 1216.62] and there's reasons why
[1214.22 - 1219.74] the Orange is in there which is just
[1216.62 - 1221.30] amazing now this is the micro C it's
[1219.74 - 1223.76] buffered
[1221.30 - 1225.50] the problem is with vitamin C's out
[1223.76 - 1229.94] there
[1225.50 - 1231.92] is they are like straight acid
[1229.94 - 1233.84] ascorbic acid
[1231.92 - 1235.70] I'm sorry
[1233.84 - 1237.74] but I can't tell you how many people
[1235.70 - 1239.36] show vitamin C's in my face
[1237.74 - 1242.12] and I'm like
[1239.36 - 1243.92] no way in hell I don't want to burn a
[1242.12 - 1247.46] hole through my stomach I don't want
[1243.92 - 1249.86] straight ascorbic acid and I see it all
[1247.46 - 1252.32] the time I got friends I got people that
[1249.86 - 1254.18] will like contact me and be like
[1252.32 - 1256.28] you know I'm on the road this is the
[1254.18 - 1257.66] only thing I could find right now and
[1256.28 - 1259.22] I'm like yeah and you're gonna burn a
[1257.66 - 1261.62] hole right right in your stomach without
[1259.22 - 1264.50] a straight ascorbic acid
[1261.62 - 1267.92] so what I love about the micro C it's
[1264.50 - 1270.50] not it's not that ascorbic acid
[1267.92 - 1272.30] right and that's a big deal all on its
[1270.50 - 1274.10] own anyway
[1272.30 - 1275.66] what I did is just I put a little honey
[1274.10 - 1278.24] in here I squeezed some orange in here
[1275.66 - 1280.76] got some warm water I put two capsules
[1278.24 - 1283.06] of the micro seed in here and I'm mixing
[1280.76 - 1283.06] it up
[1284.30 - 1290.90] I live by this right here
[1288.14 - 1292.94] oh I'm excited
[1290.90 - 1294.68] hmm
[1292.94 - 1297.14] I just love it
[1294.68 - 1299.24] it's so good you guys know about the
[1297.14 - 1300.82] continuity test too and I want to talk
[1299.24 - 1303.50] more about that
[1300.82 - 1306.02] but I've done this with vitamin C's out
[1303.50 - 1308.18] there like different vitamin C's and
[1306.02 - 1310.16] right you have it in your hand now you
[1308.18 - 1312.08] can put it in whatever hand you want to
[1310.16 - 1313.46] put it in right I'll put it in my right
[1312.08 - 1317.68] hand right now
[1313.46 - 1317.68] and put your hand on top of your head
[1317.72 - 1321.52] and you make that continuity happen
[1321.68 - 1324.98] it goes right from the supplement that's
[1323.96 - 1328.94] in your hand
[1324.98 - 1331.58] right up to the brain and back down
[1328.94 - 1333.56] so and I saw somebody doing it who
[1331.58 - 1335.72] posted about it just recently when they
[1333.56 - 1338.60] saw me do it right and they did it
[1335.72 - 1339.98] and they were describing how they felt
[1338.60 - 1341.54] when it's a product that's actually
[1339.98 - 1343.64] really pure
[1341.54 - 1345.02] and the intentions are pure and that's a
[1343.64 - 1346.88] whole other aspect of it so the
[1345.02 - 1348.92] continuity test is not just about the
[1346.88 - 1350.78] product being pure which with bimbridge
[1348.92 - 1353.06] that's that's how incredible they are
[1350.78 - 1355.28] right but it's also the intentions that
[1353.06 - 1357.62] are in the product it's about the care
[1355.28 - 1359.24] it's about the love it's about loving
[1357.62 - 1361.40] and caring enough to pick the highest
[1359.24 - 1363.26] quality it's about loving and caring
[1361.40 - 1365.36] enough not to put garbage in it and it's
[1363.26 - 1368.78] about the love and caring enough to make
[1365.36 - 1372.08] sure that all that is is there
[1368.78 - 1374.12] and so it's the intention too that
[1372.08 - 1376.22] continuity test is involved with not
[1374.12 - 1378.74] just the quality of the product as well
[1376.22 - 1380.48] it's both and that's what you would
[1378.74 - 1382.10] really really connect to which is really
[1380.48 - 1384.56] exciting
[1382.10 - 1386.36] I'm so excited about this if you guys
[1384.56 - 1389.72] I'm gonna hang out with you guys right
[1386.36 - 1391.46] now a little bit I'm gonna have my micro

[1483.08 - 1487.76] incredible
[1484.52 - 1490.64] and that pure and the quality and the
[1487.76 - 1493.10] design when you have that type of
[1490.64 - 1495.38] product right that type of vitamin C
[1493.10 - 1496.16] entering the vitamin C is for the immune
[1495.38 - 1499.82] system
[1496.16 - 1502.64] okay it's an antioxidant too so
[1499.82 - 1506.12] what I do is I envision
[1502.64 - 1510.70] seeing my white blood cells and as I'm
[1506.12 - 1510.70] relaxing and taking in that vitamin C
[1511.16 - 1515.48] and I saw that vitamin C now vitamin C
[1513.92 - 1517.94] is entering my body
[1515.48 - 1521.42] it's entering my bloodstream I see my
[1517.94 - 1524.48] white blood cells going to gobble up and
[1521.42 - 1526.04] consume that vitamin C because that's
[1524.48 - 1529.70] what I see
[1526.04 - 1532.52] and that's a real powerful way to do it
[1529.70 - 1535.22] but when you have something so pure and
[1532.52 - 1537.26] so incredible in the quality
[1535.22 - 1539.96] like democracy which is my favorite
[1537.26 - 1542.48] vitamin C in the world before they had a
[1539.96 - 1545.42] vitamin C I would have to be like a
[1542.48 - 1547.70] prisoner to other vitamin C's I'd have
[1545.42 - 1549.50] to do the ascorbic acid I'd have to do
[1547.70 - 1551.96] because you you're trying to get a
[1549.50 - 1554.66] vitamin C out there how to be a prisoner
[1551.96 - 1555.68] and it was like Freedom it was like
[1554.66 - 1557.00] freedom
[1555.68 - 1560.42] so in beverage you came out through
[1557.00 - 1562.10] micro C I was like free I'm free it was
[1560.42 - 1564.20] like unbelievable when you think about
[1562.10 - 1566.00] it because it's like are you kidding I'm
[1564.20 - 1568.64] free from all the garbage vitamin C's
[1566.00 - 1570.50] like you guys just freed me like this
[1568.64 - 1572.24] mom-and-pop company freed me and that's
[1570.50 - 1574.16] what it was and it was unbelievable so
[1572.24 - 1576.08] anyway what I do is when I'm sipping the
[1574.16 - 1578.00] vitamin C
[1576.08 - 1580.70] I'm envisioning the white blood cell
[1578.00 - 1583.34] gobbling up that microc
[1580.70 - 1585.44] and then getting stronger because it's
[1583.34 - 1588.56] feeding off of it
[1585.44 - 1592.34] my immune cells are actually eating that
[1588.56 - 1595.34] vitamin C up gobbling it up eating that
[1592.34 - 1596.96] vitamin C up and that's what I see I see
[1595.34 - 1600.26] it I Envision it
[1596.96 - 1602.84] I watch it I got my eyes closed and I'm
[1600.26 - 1604.88] singing it so that's what I do what I'll
[1602.84 - 1607.28] do is I'll have this at night before
[1604.88 - 1608.84] going to bed and I'll do that because I
[1607.28 - 1611.48] want my immune system be strong while
[1608.84 - 1614.42] I'm sleeping and I say go at it white
[1611.48 - 1616.64] blood cells get going get moving on it
[1614.42 - 1618.56] start eating up all that vitamin C I'll
[1616.64 - 1620.00] take another zip
[1618.56 - 1622.40] um
[1620.00 - 1624.62] and there it goes and I can see it and
[1622.40 - 1627.10] that's Envision it that's a powerful
[1624.62 - 1630.86] technique a powerful tool all on its own
[1627.10 - 1632.60] is actually having that consciousness of
[1630.86 - 1634.84] Consciousness your soul your physical
[1632.60 - 1636.62] brain all working together
[1634.84 - 1639.92] witnessing
[1636.62 - 1641.54] that vitamin C going down into your body
[1639.92 - 1644.30] then witnessing
[1641.54 - 1648.56] it going into your bloodstream
[1644.30 - 1650.18] and then validating and witnessing your
[1648.56 - 1652.64] white blood cells that are working for
[1650.18 - 1656.30] you as your white blood cells gobble up
[1652.64 - 1658.88] and feed off of that micro C it's about
[1656.30 - 1660.98] validating your white blood cells it's
[1658.88 - 1663.44] about validating the work that they're
[1660.98 - 1666.46] doing and all that they're doing for you
[1663.44 - 1669.62] all that counts
[1666.46 - 1673.28] so yes yes the light blast is still
[1669.62 - 1675.38] coming up Hey Jude that micro C shock
[1673.28 - 1678.62] therapy has worked wonders for us many
[1675.38 - 1681.28] times over it's incredible truly is it
[1678.62 - 1681.28] really really is
[1681.50 - 1684.74] people don't know the history of the
[1683.06 - 1686.36] supplements and how bad the quality is
[1684.74 - 1687.86] out there for years they just don't know
[1686.36 - 1689.60] people don't know the history of the
[1687.86 - 1691.40] supplement World they don't know the
[1689.60 - 1694.58] history of what's happening out there
[1691.40 - 1696.92] like they don't know any of that they
[1694.58 - 1699.68] don't know how companies are created
[1696.92 - 1701.18] they don't know how it's done they don't
[1699.68 - 1703.58] know about the manufacturing facilities
[1701.18 - 1705.50] with all their low quality techniques
[1703.58 - 1707.78] and low quality products they don't know
[1705.50 - 1710.18] about any of that and they're not
[1707.78 - 1713.66] supposed to know you're not supposed to
[1710.18 - 1715.06] know any of that and so I sit here and
[1713.66 - 1719.18] I'm telling you things
[1715.06 - 1722.60] you're not supposed to know it's crazy
[1719.18 - 1725.48] um health health with Liz

[1725.48 - 1729.26] night now incredible with your immune
[1727.58 - 1730.64] cells with your white blood cells that's
[1729.26 - 1732.26] amazing
[1730.64 - 1733.70] you guys that's why I'm so excited about
[1732.26 - 1735.86] the Vim machine because I use it for
[1733.70 - 1738.32] myself my friends my family and I don't
[1735.86 - 1741.74] want this stuff to disappear so I fully
[1738.32 - 1744.74] endorsed them 100 and yes I want to
[1741.74 - 1747.26] support them in any way I can
[1744.74 - 1750.56] because when you do things like this
[1747.26 - 1753.26] when you create products like this it's
[1750.56 - 1756.62] a game changer but it's for real though
[1753.26 - 1759.74] real and the quality is unmatched all
[1756.62 - 1762.26] right so talk about the propolis first
[1759.74 - 1763.76] of all I love all these out here right
[1762.26 - 1765.56] I love them all
[1763.76 - 1767.30] you know there's something something
[1765.56 - 1769.82] about when the micro C goes in you gotta
[1767.30 - 1772.04] start laughing I start giggling I start
[1769.82 - 1774.32] fooling around more it's really funny
[1772.04 - 1776.48] I keep these supplements on hand for my
[1774.32 - 1778.10] immune system during cold and flu I
[1776.48 - 1780.02] don't want a cold and flu I don't want
[1778.10 - 1782.54] to be held back from working I don't
[1780.02 - 1786.26] want to be beaten down I run my immune
[1782.54 - 1788.42] system drag it so I want to keep feeding
[1786.26 - 1791.06] it and keep it strong I want my bone
[1788.42 - 1792.92] marrow to produce more really powerful
[1791.06 - 1796.94] immune cells I want them to have what
[1792.92 - 1800.24] they need and because I burn my like
[1796.94 - 1803.54] candle at four ends and I mean it's
[1800.24 - 1805.88] amazing what I've done and what I do
[1803.54 - 1807.68] and when I think about it and I don't
[1805.88 - 1809.24] recommend anybody doing it that way I
[1807.68 - 1811.28] don't recommend working seven days a
[1809.24 - 1813.38] week year after year after year for
[1811.28 - 1815.90] years for decades and then you don't
[1813.38 - 1818.72] stop I don't recommend that I think it's
[1815.90 - 1821.18] kind of probably not smart but I do it
[1818.72 - 1824.24] anyway okay
[1821.18 - 1824.24] um okay
[1824.36 - 1828.50] I got a news flash for you guys a news
[1826.82 - 1830.54] flash I just have to say it I can't help
[1828.50 - 1832.40] it I gotta speak my mind it's a news
[1830.54 - 1835.76] flash
[1832.40 - 1840.08] medical medium information never
[1835.76 - 1842.36] ripped down vegans and never ripped down
[1840.08 - 1844.70] you know vegans for being vegan meaning
[1842.36 - 1846.08] and never ripped down animal protein
[1844.70 - 1848.42] eaters
[1846.08 - 1850.10] medical medium information is for animal
[1848.42 - 1852.80] protein eaters
[1850.10 - 1854.36] and vegans
[1852.80 - 1855.74] it's for people who don't eat animal
[1854.36 - 1858.02] protein and people who eat animal
[1855.74 - 1861.02] protein but yet you'll see it every day
[1858.02 - 1863.72] someone come out and be like oh I don't
[1861.02 - 1866.54] I don't really I only trust some of
[1863.72 - 1870.02] medical beams information because you
[1866.54 - 1872.24] know he's he says it's all vegan you got
[1870.02 - 1874.40] to be vegan when the hell have I ever
[1872.24 - 1877.18] said it's all vegan it has to be vegan
[1874.40 - 1877.18] and only vegan
[1877.94 - 1882.20] the reason why the vegan Community some
[1880.46 - 1885.08] of the vegan Community like some of the
[1882.20 - 1888.08] big vegan influencers hate medical
[1885.08 - 1891.02] medium is because I let people eat
[1888.08 - 1893.06] animal protein because I'm not an
[1891.02 - 1895.64] ideologue on animal you know against
[1893.06 - 1897.14] animal protein
[1895.64 - 1899.66] medical medium information actually
[1897.14 - 1901.94] gives options for everyone that's the
[1899.66 - 1904.34] whole point if you're an animal protein
[1901.94 - 1906.86] person I show you how you can use tools
[1904.34 - 1908.78] to heal while eating animal protein if
[1906.86 - 1911.12] you're a vegan person I show you the
[1908.78 - 1913.58] same and vegans don't do it right out
[1911.12 - 1916.06] there they don't you can be vegan for 20
[1913.58 - 1919.04] years and stay sick
[1916.06 - 1921.56] so you can and and still need the tools
[1919.04 - 1923.42] you need but I see it every time someone
[1921.56 - 1926.90] will do a post and start ripping into
[1923.42 - 1929.48] medical medium and his vegan vegan vegan
[1926.90 - 1932.24] whatever and meanwhile the vegan doctors
[1929.48 - 1934.70] hate medical medium because
[1932.24 - 1936.56] I allow people to have protein animal
[1934.70 - 1939.62] protein if they like because I support
[1936.56 - 1942.38] all and that angers the vegan the vegan
[1939.62 - 1944.60] upper echelons it angers them so much
[1942.38 - 1947.36] because they're all about you're an evil
[1944.60 - 1949.64] person if you even like animal protein
[1947.36 - 1951.32] uh you're an evil person about like
[1949.64 - 1953.66] that's how they are so they hate medical
[1951.32 - 1955.52] meeting because I want people to have
[1953.66 - 1956.90] the tools to heal and to know why
[1955.52 - 1959.78] they're sick and they can still do
[1956.90 - 1961.40] animal protein if they want and vvv and
[1959.78 - 1964.16] if they want
[1961.40 - 1966.20] John boyntonat says people bring their
[1964.16 - 1967.52] own perceptions and Concepts when they
[1966.20 - 1970.70] first learn about medical medium
[1967.52 - 1973.16] information do they ever do they ever
[1970.70 - 1976.18] it is unbelievable
[1973.16 - 1976.18] it is unbelievable
[1977.06 - 1981.32] it really is
[1979.10 - 1983.72] all right so
[1981.32 - 1986.20] back to this back to what we're talking
[1983.72 - 1989.42] about that was my news flash
[1986.20 - 1991.04] okay and I mean quite honestly you guys
[1989.42 - 1993.32] I mean seriously
[1991.04 - 1995.96] uh if one more person pops out of the
[1993.32 - 1996.98] blue and just says you know I just the
[1995.96 - 1998.48] thing is about medical medium
[1996.98 - 2001.42] information is
[1998.48 - 2003.40] it's it's the one thing out there that
[2001.42 - 2007.42] gets just hit all the time like we just

[2014.92 - 2020.32] about the tools it's crazy if you read
[2017.92 - 2021.58] brain saver books you'll learn how
[2020.32 - 2023.56] people's neurons have trouble
[2021.58 - 2025.00] understanding information and I see that
[2023.56 - 2027.64] happen too you've got all these people
[2025.00 - 2028.90] with all these neuron problems and they
[2027.64 - 2030.70] don't really even know what's going on
[2028.90 - 2031.90] so they instantly have this emotional
[2030.70 - 2034.00] Outburst of
[2031.90 - 2035.38] he's just a vegan and that's what he is
[2034.00 - 2036.40] he doesn't know any and whatever it's
[2035.38 - 2037.92] like okay

[2037.92 - 2042.64] dude medical medium info I've always
[2040.96 - 2044.74] been supportive animal protein people
[2042.64 - 2048.28] and vegans are like whatever

[2048.28 - 2054.22] um yeah up telephone
[2051.64 - 2056.44] is what it is all right so anyway I'm
[2054.22 - 2059.98] talking about the propolis
[2056.44 - 2062.32] I can't say enough about the propolis
[2059.98 - 2064.00] I really can't say enough about it you
[2062.32 - 2066.94] see that Liquid Gold
[2064.00 - 2068.38] it's unbelievable right
[2066.94 - 2070.78] okay
[2068.38 - 2073.24] when it's got that active quercetin
[2070.78 - 2076.06] inside of it
[2073.24 - 2078.10] it's it's from B's screen from like a
[2076.06 - 2080.32] certain amount of beekeepers really
[2078.10 - 2082.90] incredible on its own
[2080.32 - 2084.82] free goes from someone someone's neurons
[2082.90 - 2088.18] even if you read brain saver you'll hear
[2084.82 - 2090.46] it like you'll hear a story
[2088.18 - 2092.50] out there but that story already went
[2090.46 - 2094.72] through somebody's kind of like messed
[2092.50 - 2096.16] up neurons contaminated neurons and then
[2094.72 - 2098.08] went to another person with their
[2096.16 - 2100.36] contaminated neurons and went to another
[2098.08 - 2101.92] person and The Story Goes Around next
[2100.36 - 2103.66] thing you know the story by the end of
[2101.92 - 2105.34] it is completely different than what it
[2103.66 - 2107.86] was at the beginning
[2105.34 - 2110.82] I'm going to put a two dropper folds of
[2107.86 - 2110.82] this propolis in here
[2111.40 - 2114.96] there's no alcohol in here
[2115.12 - 2119.08] the extracted extraction process is like
[2117.70 - 2120.52] no other too
[2119.08 - 2123.28] like
[2120.52 - 2126.46] there's no propolis like this hands down
[2123.28 - 2129.48] when you guys try this
[2126.46 - 2129.48] this is
[2129.70 - 2132.24] like
[2133.24 - 2136.44] if someone said look

[2152.74 - 2156.58] and the quality and everything about it
[2155.32 - 2158.56] and the thing is here's what's crazy
[2156.58 - 2161.80] people don't realize

[2161.80 - 2169.18] really is they just don't know out there

[2190.84 - 2195.58] putting out there like what is this
[2193.42 - 2197.50] it's just it's just incredible yeah no
[2195.58 - 2199.90] it's Liquid Gold by far so I put two
[2197.50 - 2201.46] dropper folds in there
[2199.90 - 2203.56] okay
[2201.46 - 2206.14] but yeah
[2203.56 - 2208.06] it's got the six Active bioactive
[2206.14 - 2211.78] polytheanols in there which is amazing
[2208.06 - 2215.80] and the vermergy has up to 50 percent
[2211.78 - 2218.26] of that which is like what who can say
[2215.80 - 2220.90] that and I've been wanting I've been
[2218.26 - 2224.44] wanting a propolis to be like the real
[2220.90 - 2228.58] thing forever forever I've had to be a
[2224.44 - 2231.22] prisoner a slave to crappy propolis for
[2228.58 - 2234.16] so many decades like
[2231.22 - 2236.32] like the worst kind and coming from the
[2234.16 - 2240.40] worst places with the worst extraction
[2236.32 - 2243.64] processes and the like the worst hidden
[2240.40 - 2245.80] stuff in it and alcohol in it I've had
[2243.64 - 2249.16] to been propylene glycol and other
[2245.80 - 2251.08] alcohol I've had to be like a slave and
[2249.16 - 2253.66] and then it's so hard because you got
[2251.08 - 2255.88] Spirit of compassion telling you to be
[2253.66 - 2259.00] like you know like a person needs
[2255.88 - 2261.64] propolis a person needs this a person
[2259.00 - 2263.86] needs that and then but yet I'm telling
[2261.64 - 2267.76] Spirit of compassion but I'm a slave
[2263.86 - 2270.22] literally to this shittiest propolis to
[2267.76 - 2272.02] the crappiest propolis out there to the
[2270.22 - 2273.70] whatever and it's been torture for me
[2272.02 - 2275.08] you guys hear me crying today because
[2273.70 - 2277.42] I'm like crying is that okay okay
[2275.08 - 2280.36] because I'm doing a lot of crying right
[2277.42 - 2282.88] but it's what my life has been
[2280.36 - 2283.72] look a lot of people say oh yeah you
[2282.88 - 2285.00] know
[2283.72 - 2287.38] that aw
[2285.00 - 2289.84] uh I'd love to hang out with him and
[2287.38 - 2291.70] talk shop with him you know that would
[2289.84 - 2294.34] be amazing you know what you would hear
[2291.70 - 2296.98] you would hear me saying this right here
[2294.34 - 2299.02] it's like literally I have like gone
[2296.98 - 2300.82] through hell and back with the crap out
[2299.02 - 2303.52] there you got spiritual compassion
[2300.82 - 2306.40] saying they need propolis
[2303.52 - 2308.26] the people need that and then me saying
[2306.40 - 2310.66] but there's nothing but out there
[2308.26 - 2313.36] Spirit of compassion and then he says
[2310.66 - 2314.56] can you watch your swears but the point
[2313.36 - 2318.04] is
[2314.56 - 2321.28] is that that's what it's been like so
[2318.04 - 2323.14] when Bemidji decided to change the rules
[2321.28 - 2325.54] with propolis because that's what they
[2323.14 - 2329.92] did they changed the rules
[2325.54 - 2332.20] it's like a Hallelujah moment
[2329.92 - 2333.64] it's like an amen moment
[2332.20 - 2335.14] when you taste his propolis you'll
[2333.64 - 2338.20] instantly know the difference and I'm
[2335.14 - 2340.48] going to do the continuity test right
[2338.20 - 2342.76] and you know what's incredible you'll
[2340.48 - 2344.80] notice with the propolis when you do the
[2342.76 - 2346.30] continuity test
[2344.80 - 2349.00] remember this isn't Kinesiology
[2346.30 - 2352.12] Kinesiology is somebody else's free will
[2349.00 - 2353.16] it's somebody else's free will you you
[2352.12 - 2356.50] you
[2353.16 - 2358.78] submit your own free will your free will
[2356.50 - 2360.88] is completely canceled out I'm not
[2358.78 - 2362.20] saying anything bad about Kinesiology or
[2360.88 - 2364.66] muscle testing I'm not so I don't want
[2362.20 - 2367.00] any I got enough people
[2364.66 - 2369.28] that hate me for everything for for
[2367.00 - 2372.10] telling all the truth for all the truth
[2369.28 - 2374.38] bombs I got enough people that freaking
[2372.10 - 2376.00] hate me and whatever because of all the
[2374.38 - 2378.88] truth bombs
[2376.00 - 2380.62] right the apple cider vinegar crowd the
[2378.88 - 2382.84] Ayahuasca crowd just everybody hates me
[2380.62 - 2384.10] the caffeine crowd whatever just you
[2382.84 - 2385.54] know the whole bit right because it's
[2384.10 - 2387.52] all about money money money out there
[2385.54 - 2389.68] right and so
[2387.52 - 2391.48] you know the copper vessel crowd you
[2389.68 - 2393.82] know the copper vessel crowd like copper
[2391.48 - 2395.08] copper drinking container crap they hate
[2393.82 - 2396.88] me because you know you get copper
[2395.08 - 2398.68] poisoning from those things but the
[2396.88 - 2401.32] point is I got enough I put out all the
[2398.68 - 2402.76] truth bombs constantly
[2401.32 - 2404.26] and it's just
[2402.76 - 2405.88] chill yeah remember she's having a sale
[2404.26 - 2408.82] right now
[2405.88 - 2411.22] but it's like it's just you know you
[2408.82 - 2413.62] constantly put out the information and
[2411.22 - 2415.36] you just get bashed for it right that's
[2413.62 - 2416.74] what you do you get bashed for it so I'm
[2415.36 - 2418.00] not trying to I'm not ripping apart
[2416.74 - 2419.50] kinesiologists we have a lot of
[2418.00 - 2421.00] Kinesiology people that actually love
[2419.50 - 2422.02] medical medium stuff if they're out
[2421.00 - 2423.88] there in the community so I'm not
[2422.02 - 2427.42] ripping apart Kinesiology or muscle
[2423.88 - 2429.28] testing I'm not I'm just saying that
[2427.42 - 2432.04] this continuity test Spirit of
[2429.28 - 2435.46] compassion taught me is not Kinesiology
[2432.04 - 2439.12] because you're using your own free will
[2435.46 - 2441.34] you're not submitting your free will
[2439.12 - 2442.90] or your soul or anything else for
[2441.34 - 2444.94] somebody else's free will to do your
[2442.90 - 2446.44] Kinesiology right you're doing your own
[2444.94 - 2449.02] there's a big difference right here so
[2446.44 - 2452.32] the continuity test is really powerful
[2449.02 - 2454.06] your main lining the energy from the
[2452.32 - 2456.70] product through your arm to the other
[2454.06 - 2460.12] arm into the brain and the brain is
[2456.70 - 2461.68] sending it back to your hand
[2460.12 - 2463.54] and you're doing with your own free will
[2461.68 - 2465.04] and that's the difference when you deal
[2463.54 - 2466.54] with the propolis it's like oh my God
[2465.04 - 2468.34] anyway
[2466.54 - 2470.38] what I really love about the pro now

[2583.00 - 2588.82] so that's what I do I've trained myself
[2586.66 - 2591.40] or should I say Spirit of compassion has
[2588.82 - 2593.44] taught me and then I have
[2591.40 - 2594.70] kind of like retrained myself with it
[2593.44 - 2597.82] right
[2594.70 - 2599.92] every time I sip
[2597.82 - 2602.20] the vitamin C shock therapy the medical
[2599.92 - 2604.96] medium right
[2602.20 - 2608.20] I instantly see my immune cells
[2604.96 - 2609.82] you can actually take yourself to the
[2608.20 - 2613.42] next level with that
[2609.82 - 2616.20] every time I use the propolis every time
[2613.42 - 2616.20] I use it
[2617.38 - 2624.58] I train myself to connect with my immune
[2621.04 - 2628.02] cells and it goes in like that right
[2624.58 - 2628.02] as the propolis is going in
[2628.18 - 2633.16] I instantly see my immune cells you can
[2631.66 - 2636.34] do that
[2633.16 - 2638.62] you can wire yourself to connect to your
[2636.34 - 2640.78] immune system constantly
[2638.62 - 2643.26] and that's what I do so every time I
[2640.78 - 2643.26] take a sip
[2643.54 - 2648.22] I see my immune cells
[2646.36 - 2649.66] and that's what I do
[2648.22 - 2651.82] two of my favorite supplements is
[2649.66 - 2654.58] support through cold and flu is cat's
[2651.82 - 2657.34] claw and Goldenseal
[2654.58 - 2659.26] where's my that's my B12 that's my
[2657.34 - 2661.48] golden seal right there Goldenseal I
[2659.26 - 2664.00] always say speaks for itself
[2661.48 - 2666.64] it does not need an intro it does not
[2664.00 - 2669.34] need a whole explanation it doesn't need
[2666.64 - 2671.04] anything it just needs one word and one
[2669.34 - 2674.02] one word only
[2671.04 - 2675.76] Goldenseal that's what it needs it
[2674.02 - 2677.80] doesn't need any more than that
[2675.76 - 2680.68] and that's what I love about Goldenseal
[2677.80 - 2683.86] because the plant itself
[2680.68 - 2685.72] the plant itself the identity of the
[2683.86 - 2687.46] plant if you know herbs
[2685.72 - 2689.20] I've been taught about herbs from Spirit
[2687.46 - 2692.20] of compassion I spent a lot of time in
[2689.20 - 2694.36] the field and just out there in nature
[2692.20 - 2696.40] and when I cut you know when you see
[2694.36 - 2698.86] Goldenseal
[2696.40 - 2703.00] if you ever grown it or anything
[2698.86 - 2704.86] it's more of hi Goldenseal my name is
[2703.00 - 2707.28] Anthony William
[2704.86 - 2710.32] Goldenseal needs nothing else
[2707.28 - 2711.46] it just doesn't if anything it's got to
[2710.32 - 2714.46] be the opposite
[2711.46 - 2716.62] um Goldenseal my name's Anthony
[2714.46 - 2717.84] yeah Anthony William the medical medium

[2744.64 - 2749.14] protection booklet has saved us
[2747.04 - 2751.06] countless times and shared it with many
[2749.14 - 2752.92] who needed it

[2774.16 - 2779.14] talk about the cat's claw
[2776.74 - 2780.88] where is my cat's ball here it is
[2779.14 - 2782.86] I'm in the golden sea I'm gonna pop in

[2787.00 - 2790.06] everything here we go I'm gonna put a
[2788.80 - 2792.54] little golden seal in here if you guys
[2790.06 - 2792.54] don't mind
[2793.90 - 2799.42] I am liking this shot

[2799.42 - 2802.96] got some golden seal in there I got some
[2801.16 - 2805.68] propolis in there now I'm gonna put some
[2802.96 - 2810.36] cats call in there
[2805.68 - 2810.36] very good cats go up
[2813.04 - 2817.84] now I'm not trying to brag or boast or
[2815.68 - 2820.00] anything
[2817.84 - 2821.68] but cat's claw
[2820.00 - 2823.54] is out there
[2821.68 - 2825.94] because of the hard work from Spirit of
[2823.54 - 2829.90] compassion
[2825.94 - 2832.06] uh pushing me to teach about it for over
[2829.90 - 2833.74] 35 years
[2832.06 - 2836.32] so it became something in the
[2833.74 - 2839.86] Alternative Health movement
[2836.32 - 2842.20] so and I'm not trying to brag or boast
[2839.86 - 2843.70] but cat's claw so if you see cat's claw
[2842.20 - 2846.40] talked about out there you see cats go
[2843.70 - 2848.20] out there you're a welcome you're
[2846.40 - 2850.30] welcome you're welcome
[2848.20 - 2852.22] he used to be the only
[2850.30 - 2854.74] um it used to be the only in dried form
[2852.22 - 2856.06] like in dried form and then the cat's
[2854.74 - 2859.54] claw that you would find out there in
[2856.06 - 2861.34] supplement form I was a slave too if I
[2859.54 - 2864.40] wanted it in a supplement form and it
[2861.34 - 2866.20] was always low quality always it started
[2864.40 - 2868.18] out where it was only in capsules and
[2866.20 - 2871.12] then it was in alcohol tinctures with
[2868.18 - 2873.70] alcohol like I can't tell you like the
[2871.12 - 2875.86] road to get to this point
[2873.70 - 2877.54] I I don't even know what to say like in
[2875.86 - 2879.40] in cat's Claw is used for Lyme disease
[2877.54 - 2882.52] because of medical medium information
[2879.40 - 2885.34] but the road with cat's claw has been an
[2882.52 - 2888.28] arduous long one okay so it started out
[2885.34 - 2890.80] where the only way to get it was just a
[2888.28 - 2893.08] bulk dried herb right and it was hard to
[2890.80 - 2895.18] get a hold of a long time ago really
[2893.08 - 2897.16] hard like I can't even tell you the
[2895.18 - 2899.98] process and what it took how to travel
[2897.16 - 2901.96] to get it to find inmate connections a
[2899.98 - 2904.36] long time ago to actually get it in my
[2901.96 - 2906.10] hand right and then to be able to help
[2904.36 - 2908.74] people with it okay that's the first and
[2906.10 - 2910.30] foremost then that road turned into some
[2908.74 - 2912.04] supplement company some low quality
[2910.30 - 2914.56] supplement companies out there now
[2912.04 - 2917.02] turning it into capsules that was the
[2914.56 - 2919.18] next aspect of it right but that was
[2917.02 - 2921.22] also a hard Road and that wasn't the
[2919.18 - 2923.86] answer and then some bad supplement
[2921.22 - 2926.14] companies put it in alcohol tincture so
[2923.86 - 2927.76] they put it in an alcohol tincture and
[2926.14 - 2930.46] when they did that there was that
[2927.76 - 2932.92] arduous Road of trying to get like it's
[2930.46 - 2935.44] been torture so to actually have it in
[2932.92 - 2938.14] this form right now today in this
[2935.44 - 2940.72] quality is just utterly insane when I
[2938.14 - 2943.24] think about it so anyway
[2940.72 - 2945.78] it's just really special I'm gonna pop
[2943.24 - 2945.78] some in there

[2952.60 - 2955.96] stuff

[3007.74 - 3012.00] and flu season so what happens is with
[3010.56 - 3013.98] people is when they start getting that
[3012.00 - 3015.54] they start getting that scratchy throat
[3013.98 - 3017.22] that's one way it hits or they start
[3015.54 - 3019.68] feeling they have a golf ball inside
[3017.22 - 3021.66] their throat right here or they feel
[3019.68 - 3024.06] like they're getting sore throats on the
[3021.66 - 3026.58] side or they feel like they got
[3024.06 - 3028.56] something like just their chest is heavy
[3026.58 - 3030.96] up here and it just starts out and then
[3028.56 - 3032.88] you start getting achy but whatever way
[3030.96 - 3036.36] they feel it once it starts coming on
[3032.88 - 3038.04] it's like no no and that's what people
[3036.36 - 3040.08] go through with the cold and flu there's
[3038.04 - 3041.88] nothing more annoying than getting that
[3040.08 - 3044.34] and it comes in and then it's like I
[3041.88 - 3046.14] want to be productive I want to get up
[3044.34 - 3048.36] and work in the kitchen but I'm about to
[3046.14 - 3050.40] pass out you know I want to go and do
[3048.36 - 3052.26] something I want to hop in the car and
[3050.40 - 3054.72] you're just you're so sick I just see
[3052.26 - 3056.76] people suffer from it it's awful I want
[3054.72 - 3059.40] to be helpful in any way I can let's
[3056.76 - 3061.44] make some time water
[3059.40 - 3065.12] so I got some
[3061.44 - 3065.12] water here in front of me
[3065.34 - 3071.16] all right it's in this jug
[3068.76 - 3074.22] how simple is this
[3071.16 - 3076.92] you take your hand
[3074.22 - 3078.72] you find some time
[3076.92 - 3081.36] nice
[3078.72 - 3083.30] you take that time and you pop it in
[3081.36 - 3085.98] here
[3083.30 - 3088.20] I like simple
[3085.98 - 3090.60] simple but powerful
[3088.20 - 3093.78] the recipe is in the cold and flu free
[3090.60 - 3096.18] toolkit medicalmedium.com download it so
[3093.78 - 3098.70] you have it how incredible print it out
[3096.18 - 3101.10] is what I recommend
[3098.70 - 3103.32] I have time inside this water this water
[3101.10 - 3105.66] can go anywhere it can sit here all day
[3103.32 - 3108.14] with it in there it can be also in the
[3105.66 - 3108.14] refrigerator
[3108.18 - 3114.54] when you're using this
[3111.72 - 3116.46] you can pour it in
[3114.54 - 3118.74] something
[3116.46 - 3120.24] right
[3118.74 - 3122.10] and then you can add a little bit of
[3120.24 - 3124.86] lemon if you really want to you can add
[3122.10 - 3126.90] a little bit of lemon or lime a little
[3124.86 - 3129.12] bit of honey if you want to you don't
[3126.90 - 3131.52] have to have it as plain time water but
[3129.12 - 3133.08] I like it plain in here a lot because
[3131.52 - 3135.12] that's what I'll do is put in here the
[3133.08 - 3136.80] recipes in in the tool kit and then you
[3135.12 - 3140.22] have it sitting but that's incredible
[3136.80 - 3144.54] all in its own now time is a powerful
[3140.22 - 3147.36] tool no question for the immune system
[3144.54 - 3149.04] I don't care what anybody says it just
[3147.36 - 3150.72] is
[3149.04 - 3151.80] you know what's amazing about Spirit of
[3150.72 - 3155.46] compassion
[3151.80 - 3157.14] right the one piece of Freedom that I've
[3155.46 - 3159.66] had throughout this torturous life of
[3157.14 - 3161.04] having to do what I have to do right the
[3159.66 - 3162.96] curse of hearing Spirit of compassion
[3161.04 - 3164.94] since I was age four the one thing
[3162.96 - 3166.92] that's really remarkable
[3164.94 - 3169.20] is it's information you don't hear
[3166.92 - 3170.64] anywhere else but I know here's what the
[3169.20 - 3172.68] here's the critics or the not the
[3170.64 - 3176.40] critics here's what the haters will do
[3172.68 - 3179.70] the haters right so if you say the word
[3176.40 - 3181.44] time they'll be like oh that's not
[3179.70 - 3184.20] original or unique because he said the
[3181.44 - 3186.60] word time he said that well time has
[3184.20 - 3188.34] been growing here but when you see
[3186.60 - 3190.38] medical meme information on what time
[3188.34 - 3193.08] does that's never been said anywhere
[3190.38 - 3196.26] else or you see in medical meme
[3193.08 - 3198.06] information with celery juices what does
[3196.26 - 3200.10] where you can't find anywhere else
[3198.06 - 3203.10] that's where it's like the freedom is
[3200.10 - 3204.72] everywhere in the mm info the Freedom's
[3203.10 - 3206.94] there it's all the original information
[3204.72 - 3209.28] that's just freeing people of their
[3206.94 - 3211.98] ailments it's amazing I release the info
[3209.28 - 3213.60] of these Deca about this decades ago too
[3211.98 - 3216.72] and a lot of people steal it so here's
[3213.60 - 3219.38] the thing just like the Mercury amalgos
[3216.72 - 3219.38] you guys
[3220.08 - 3226.62] in the 80s
[3222.18 - 3230.34] okay Mercury amalgams were like
[3226.62 - 3231.84] being put in everybody without any any
[3230.34 - 3233.40] opposition
[3231.84 - 3236.16] whatsoever
[3233.40 - 3238.68] I would go on like a tour
[3236.16 - 3240.90] and go to dental I had a dentist friend
[3238.68 - 3243.54] really old guy he was like a 90 year old
[3240.90 - 3244.92] dentist he would take me to dentist
[3243.54 - 3247.98] conventions
[3244.92 - 3250.38] and literally I'd be the only one saying
[3247.98 - 3252.12] we can't do the Mercury anymore we can't
[3250.38 - 3254.40] do the Mercury anymore
[3252.12 - 3256.86] they all just would look at me like are
[3254.40 - 3258.90] you insane and these were Advanced
[3256.86 - 3260.52] people conventional and alternative it
[3258.90 - 3263.04] was like alternative and conventional
[3260.52 - 3266.22] people you know it was like the amount
[3263.04 - 3269.46] of work to get like the amalgams to stop
[3266.22 - 3272.28] going into people's Jaws it took it took
[3269.46 - 3274.02] years and years for it to spread and
[3272.28 - 3276.06] then teach about it and for it to spread
[3274.02 - 3278.58] and teach about it you know I say the
[3276.06 - 3279.90] spirit of compassion if I didn't exist
[3278.58 - 3282.18] right
[3279.90 - 3284.16] and I I wasn't fighting for The Chronic
[3282.18 - 3287.46] Leo all these decades going all the way
[3284.16 - 3289.44] back what would the landscape look like
[3287.46 - 3291.84] it would be unbelievable the difference
[3289.44 - 3294.00] would be insane actually
[3291.84 - 3295.68] just like what you see happening today I
[3294.00 - 3297.78] put something new out brand new
[3295.68 - 3299.34] information from the books in the
[3297.78 - 3301.56] podcast and the lives and then people
[3299.34 - 3303.72] take it and don't cite it back and they
[3301.56 - 3306.18] feel like it was out there already
[3303.72 - 3307.98] and it wasn't out there already they act
[3306.18 - 3309.30] like it was out there already and it
[3307.98 - 3311.58] wasn't
[3309.30 - 3314.40] anyway
[3311.58 - 3316.20] woe is me but at the same time I'm
[3314.40 - 3318.80] crying the blues I'm going to sip a
[3316.20 - 3318.80] little bit more of this
[3318.96 - 3321.72] hurts other people is what it does
[3320.52 - 3323.28] because they can't find the information
[3321.72 - 3325.74] where it comes from and then they can't
[3323.28 - 3327.96] heal that's why the woe is me because

[3377.16 - 3382.80] when you leave this short life you do
[3379.74 - 3388.40] have to answer somewhere somehow for all
[3382.80 - 3388.40] the evil you have done it's like
[3389.60 - 3393.72] people think they don't have to answer
[3391.98 - 3395.70] it anyway whether it's in their own
[3393.72 - 3397.14] conscious mind or subconscious or Soul

[3587.88 - 3592.38] about medical medium they don't want to
[3589.86 - 3595.02] hear it all because of where you get the
[3592.38 - 3597.00] information so grateful someone informed
[3595.02 - 3599.64] me
[3597.00 - 3601.68] and here's the thing
[3599.64 - 3603.84] someone informed you right
[3601.68 - 3606.06] but in a way that's divine intervention
[3603.84 - 3608.70] isn't it is it providential is divine
[3606.06 - 3610.08] intervention is it spiritual forces is
[3608.70 - 3612.72] it
[3610.08 - 3614.40] is it all of the above is it Angelic is
[3612.72 - 3616.14] it Angels because Spirit of compassion
[3614.40 - 3618.30] always told me that the person who
[3616.14 - 3620.88] receives who understands this
[3618.30 - 3623.64] information in here whoever receives the
[3620.88 - 3626.64] word and and learns from it and and
[3623.64 - 3628.08] finds it it's it is spiritual
[3626.64 - 3630.18] intervention
[3628.08 - 3634.56] from a Divine source
[3630.18 - 3636.66] whether an angel had you find it
[3634.56 - 3640.26] and it's unbelievable when I think about
[3636.66 - 3642.90] that or an angel shows you something and
[3640.26 - 3644.70] then you're like what is this
[3642.90 - 3647.58] and you know what's crazy yet everyone
[3644.70 - 3649.68] out there is so spiritual but yet they
[3647.58 - 3653.10] don't want to believe or something that
[3649.68 - 3655.44] all this these volumes of of
[3653.10 - 3658.14] incredible advanced
[3655.44 - 3660.06] a real Advanced information about way
[3658.14 - 3661.86] ahead of science and research comes from
[3660.06 - 3663.48] a voice I hear
[3661.86 - 3666.72] or they'll be like well maybe he's a
[3663.48 - 3668.52] genius no I'm not a genius besides
[3666.72 - 3670.86] there's Geniuses out there and they
[3668.52 - 3672.78] can't even they can't even produce this
[3670.86 - 3675.30] it's not possible
[3672.78 - 3676.50] so and everybody's so spiritual they're
[3675.30 - 3677.52] all going to yoga and they're all
[3676.50 - 3679.26] talking spiritual and they're all
[3677.52 - 3681.72] sitting around campfires
[3679.26 - 3683.82] you know sucking down like
[3681.72 - 3685.62] yeah micro dosing mushrooms and sucking
[3683.82 - 3687.48] down Ayahuasca and
[3685.62 - 3689.46] smoking weed all day and talking about
[3687.48 - 3691.32] the universe and everybody's so
[3689.46 - 3694.50] spiritual now they're also spiritual
[3691.32 - 3696.42] everybody is like everybody now and but
[3694.50 - 3698.10] yet what it's hard to believe this or
[3696.42 - 3700.08] something
[3698.10 - 3702.84] you know you just open up the box and
[3700.08 - 3705.38] just see what's in here
[3702.84 - 3705.38] really
[3705.78 - 3710.10] or are they spiritual
[3708.12 - 3711.54] that's the question are they really
[3710.10 - 3713.88] spiritual
[3711.54 - 3716.28] are they just posers
[3713.88 - 3717.96] acting like they're spiritual pretending
[3716.28 - 3719.46] they're spiritual or they think they're
[3717.96 - 3721.70] spiritual but they're really not
[3719.46 - 3724.86] spiritual because they're not even open
[3721.70 - 3727.02] open-minded enough to know that this is
[3724.86 - 3729.42] like incredible so
[3727.02 - 3732.06] are they just posers Spirit of
[3729.42 - 3736.02] compassion told me when I was younger
[3732.06 - 3737.46] don't don't don't act spiritual I was
[3736.02 - 3738.90] like I'm not
[3737.46 - 3740.04] sure the company I said don't act
[3738.90 - 3742.44] spiritual
[3740.04 - 3744.30] don't just go around every second you
[3742.44 - 3746.34] know with like a robe on and just be
[3744.30 - 3748.56] because you hear it can happen because
[3746.34 - 3750.60] you hear you hear me Spirit of
[3748.56 - 3753.66] compassion said and because you hear a
[3750.60 - 3755.82] voice and you have this information it's
[3753.66 - 3758.10] easy to fall into that Spirit of
[3755.82 - 3761.18] compassion said don't don't don't act
[3758.10 - 3761.18] like a spiritual Guru
[3761.46 - 3765.00] don't I mean there's nothing wrong with
[3763.20 - 3767.64] praying hands there's nothing wrong with
[3765.00 - 3769.86] anything but it's very compassion said
[3767.64 - 3772.26] don't like
[3769.86 - 3775.56] act like you walk on water or anything
[3772.26 - 3777.30] like that I said I don't I just throw my
[3775.56 - 3779.04] sloppy clothes on and I'm ready to just
[3777.30 - 3781.98] deliver just give me the information so
[3779.04 - 3786.08] I can deliver just
[3781.98 - 3786.08] I need to get that information out there
[3786.54 - 3790.68] and I mean and you know and I pray and
[3789.24 - 3792.24] and all of that and I do the medical
[3790.68 - 3794.10] media meditations and I pray and
[3792.24 - 3796.86] everything but I don't mean by that I
[3794.10 - 3799.86] mean by you know what I'm talking about
[3796.86 - 3802.38] so anyway olive leaf right there is one
[3799.86 - 3804.00] of my favorites but once again it's like
[3802.38 - 3806.52] the same old story
[3804.00 - 3808.74] being a prisoner to the bad Olive Leafs
[3806.52 - 3811.56] out there to the ones in alcohol and the
[3808.74 - 3814.50] ones in real bad you know glycerin the
[3811.56 - 3816.42] bad bad stuff or be all of that like
[3814.50 - 3818.46] just being you know but not just that
[3816.42 - 3820.44] hidden ingredients is what I'm saying
[3818.46 - 3821.82] like the hidden ingredients out there
[3820.44 - 3824.70] like being
[3821.82 - 3826.38] a slave to bad Olive leaves that was
[3824.70 - 3827.88] something that was really hard so I love
[3826.38 - 3831.02] that for the immune system too they all
[3827.88 - 3831.02] if I'm gonna put that in here
