[183.84 - 186.56] keep you
[184.40 - 188.08] in it the whole time because the
[186.56 - 190.56] information
[188.08 - 192.08] just is something you've never heard
[190.56 - 194.56] this information before
[192.08 - 196.00] you just need to know that and when it
[194.56 - 197.60] comes down to matcha tea when it comes
[196.00 - 199.84] down to coffee when it comes comes down
[197.60 - 202.24] to chocolate we're told right now
[199.84 - 203.28] that it's really great for us that's
[202.24 - 206.16] what we're told
[203.28 - 208.32] but there's something inside of us all
[206.16 - 210.96] that knows a little better than that
[208.32 - 212.00] we know when we get jacked up we know
[210.96 - 215.28] you when we get jacked
[212.00 - 218.48] up on caffeine what that's like right
[215.28 - 221.60] and i don't blame anyone at all
[218.48 - 223.68] on any level for being on coffee
[221.60 - 226.40] for being on chocolate for being on
[223.68 - 229.12] matcha tea for being on caffeine at all
[226.40 - 231.04] energy drinks i don't blame anybody at
[229.12 - 231.92] all and i'm on your side are you kidding
[231.04 - 233.52] me because
[231.92 - 235.20] when you got some brain fog and you
[233.52 - 238.48] don't feel that good
[235.20 - 238.88] and you know life is hard and we kind of
[238.48 - 241.36] we
[238.88 - 243.68] we lean on these things i mean we can
[241.36 - 245.52] have energy issues we cannot feel good
[243.68 - 247.92] we can have fatigue
[245.52 - 248.88] and you know the focus and concentration
[247.92 - 251.76] so you guys
[248.88 - 253.60] you have to know like i'm with you i'm
[251.76 - 254.96] on your side if you have to do chocolate
[253.60 - 256.96] if you have to do matcha tea if you have
[254.96 - 258.96] to do coffee to survive
[256.96 - 260.48] because you've got low energy issues and
[258.96 - 262.72] fatigue and brain fog
[260.48 - 263.68] and you can't think because something
[262.72 - 265.52] else is going on
[263.68 - 267.44] because that's the whole point where
[265.52 - 270.48] we're a society today
[267.44 - 271.92] the human race is bogged down with all
[270.48 - 275.04] these symptoms now
[271.92 - 276.00] and so we have to get jacked up on
[275.04 - 278.56] caffeine
[276.00 - 279.04] it's and then we get told that it's good
[278.56 - 280.72] for us
[279.04 - 282.40] because of a study that may comes that
[280.72 - 284.72] may come out like antioxidants there
[282.40 - 286.48] might be some antioxidants in matcha tea
[284.72 - 288.48] there's some antioxidants in coffee
[286.48 - 291.04] there's antioxidants and chocolate
[288.48 - 291.84] and i talk about that too about about
[291.04 - 295.28] studies
[291.84 - 297.92] and how they might be kind of biased and
[295.28 - 299.68] paid for by caffeine industry so it's
[297.92 - 301.36] really interesting the whole thing is
[299.68 - 302.80] whole thing is a mind blower i hope you
[301.36 - 304.48] guys catch it
[302.80 - 305.92] because it's a mind blower really is

[667.84 - 672.72] matcha tea okay chocolate episode
[670.88 - 674.40] it's really jam-packed with information
[672.72 - 675.52] i talk about how caffeine affects our
[674.40 - 677.76] adrenals
[675.52 - 678.88] how it affects our liver how it affects
[677.76 - 682.48] our skin
[678.88 - 686.64] how it ages us quicker why we're told
[682.48 - 689.68] it doesn't age us why we're told that
[686.64 - 692.96] it's good for us okay
[689.68 - 695.12] and how and and and how
[692.96 - 697.76] how we struggle through withdrawal and
[695.12 - 700.80] how that works on how the caffeine
[697.76 - 701.68] just just stays in the emotional center
[700.80 - 703.36] of the brain
[701.68 - 705.52] and we have this relationship with
[703.36 - 708.24] caffeine that we can't break
[705.52 - 709.28] i also talk about surgeons can't go
[708.24 - 710.96] through withdrawal
[709.28 - 713.20] so i have a have a friend who's a
[710.96 - 716.40] surgeon and
[713.20 - 718.00] and how she filled me in on how surgeons
[716.40 - 719.52] don't want to go through withdrawal and
[718.00 - 720.32] there's a whole thing about that i talk
[719.52 - 721.92] about how
[720.32 - 723.84] wow i mean the information in this
[721.92 - 725.60] episode is mind-blowing
[723.84 - 727.68] catherine says the moon meditation was
[725.60 - 729.36] so powerful awesome you should do it all
[727.68 - 730.00] the time even when there's no moon up
[729.36 - 731.68] there
[730.00 - 733.52] or no moon in the moment or you can't
[731.68 - 734.80] see the moon it's that powerful of a
[733.52 - 736.32] meditation
[734.80 - 737.84] uh karen says from the bottom of my
[736.32 - 739.76] heart thank you for all you do for us
[737.84 - 742.32] with chronic illness the moon meditation
[739.76 - 744.72] is fantastic i'll keep on doing it
[742.32 - 747.60] and share it share it on your platforms
[744.72 - 749.68] you guys share it with anybody you can
[747.60 - 750.88] facebook youtube all of that please
[749.68 - 751.28] share it because it's the only way it's
[750.88 - 752.32] going to
[751.28 - 754.72] get around because you've got to
[752.32 - 756.40] remember medical medium information was
[754.72 - 758.16] always grassroots
[756.40 - 759.52] it was always people healing only and
[758.16 - 761.76] that's how it spread around
[759.52 - 762.72] the world and it's all through that
[761.76 - 764.64] grassroots
[762.72 - 765.92] it wasn't through any marketing it
[764.64 - 768.16] wasn't through any of that
[765.92 - 769.60] so i never had mark marketing big
[768.16 - 772.00] marketing pr
[769.60 - 774.00] never had any of that so the reason why
[772.00 - 774.80] i got around was because it's healing
[774.00 - 776.48] people and people
[774.80 - 778.00] shared it so if you can keep on doing
[776.48 - 779.20] that share the podcast because the
[778.00 - 781.92] podcast
[779.20 - 783.60] is not going to disappoint i promise you
[781.92 - 784.48] from the chemtrail episode to the fruit
[783.60 - 786.88] fear episode
[784.48 - 789.04] to the eggs eaters lose all episode to
[786.88 - 790.80] the brain meditation the moon meditation
[789.04 - 792.56] to the air freshener episode to the
[790.80 - 795.28] caffeine episode that you're
[792.56 - 797.04] that you're hearing um now that you can
[795.28 - 799.20] hear now so
[797.04 - 800.48] margie says i only had one coffee i
[799.20 - 802.64] think you said
[800.48 - 804.16] i think what was that it went back up
[802.64 - 805.84] but it's it's interesting you know it's
[804.16 - 807.60] like it's hard to
[805.84 - 809.52] it's hard to get off our coffee much tea
[807.60 - 812.48] but here's the thing i
[809.52 - 814.24] support if you have to use it remember
[812.48 - 816.16] that like i support if
[814.24 - 817.68] if you're on coffee there's a reason why
[816.16 - 819.12] you're on coffee you probably don't feel
[817.68 - 820.80] that great you probably have some focus
[819.12 - 824.00] concentration things going on
[820.80 - 825.76] maybe some toxic heavy metals and
[824.00 - 827.52] other things going on so i get it or
[825.76 - 829.84] your adrenals they're just they're just
[827.52 - 832.56] not up to par so then we use caffeine
[829.84 - 834.64] to try to jack them up but then i talk
[832.56 - 837.44] about how this can kind of hurt us
[834.64 - 839.36] hurt us along the way and how we need to
[837.44 - 841.76] protect ourselves and protect
[839.36 - 843.20] our adrenals and protect our liver and i
[841.76 - 845.44] talk about how
[843.20 - 846.64] it's not as anti-aging as people think
[845.44 - 849.84] it is so
[846.64 - 852.08] very important there so yeah
[849.84 - 853.60] you know what with coffee if you need
[852.08 - 856.00] coffee to actually
[853.60 - 857.60] keep yourself level you stay on it if
[856.00 - 858.96] you need coffee to keep yourself level
[857.60 - 861.68] you stay on it so
[858.96 - 863.92] it's that kind of thing if if you have
[861.68 - 865.44] if you know that it's the only way that
[863.92 - 866.48] you're gonna push through
[865.44 - 867.92] and you're doing all these other
[866.48 - 869.12] incredible things for yourself then you
[867.92 - 870.88] keep coffee in there
[869.12 - 872.40] that's that's what you can do and i've
[870.88 - 874.16] always stood behind that
[872.40 - 876.40] someone said to me recently they're like
[874.16 - 877.76] oh you don't like the caffeine thing
[876.40 - 879.44] you don't like caffeine and the
[877.76 - 881.84] chocolate and all this stuff and

[1088.32 - 1093.36] release this episode
[1090.08 - 1097.04] because this episode is
[1093.36 - 1099.04] like this one's a troublemaker because
[1097.04 - 1100.96] man i mean i know people love to protect
[1099.04 - 1102.16] your eggs totally get it i know they
[1100.96 - 1104.08] they love to protect their eggs and when
[1102.16 - 1105.20] i release the egg episode i was actually
[1104.08 - 1109.04] nervous
[1105.20 - 1111.60] and but this episode i'm talking about
[1109.04 - 1113.28] the caffeine monster what that is i'm

[1120.16 - 1127.36] a whole nother game here so um
[1124.72 - 1129.04] and in the and the bottom line is this i
[1127.36 - 1130.80] just want to say this okay
[1129.04 - 1132.80] if you had to go on caffeine in your
[1130.80 - 1133.68] life if you had to go on some kind of

[1433.44 - 1438.24] pull has the ability to pull
[1435.44 - 1439.44] that hurt out of the soul so hardships
[1438.24 - 1441.60] loss betrayals
[1439.44 - 1442.80] trust issues all these things remember
[1441.60 - 1444.48] the moon meditation
[1442.80 - 1446.32] tell other people to listen to that one
[1444.48 - 1448.24] too get that one
[1446.32 - 1449.52] out there tell them apple podcast tell
[1448.24 - 1450.80] them that's where they have to hear it
[1449.52 - 1452.00] because it's uncensored it's the best
[1450.80 - 1454.80] part for it
[1452.00 - 1455.76] um and i talk about hair loss too hair
[1454.80 - 1457.68] loss in women
[1455.76 - 1459.60] with caffeine or when you're doing
[1457.68 - 1461.36] caffeine for a few years or a couple
[1459.60 - 1463.44] years or even 10 years and then you get
[1461.36 - 1465.84] the hair thinning later for women
[1463.44 - 1467.52] and how that's different for men but for
[1465.84 - 1468.08] women how you get the hair thinning
[1467.52 - 1470.00] because
[1468.08 - 1471.44] women's adrenals and i talk about that
[1470.00 - 1473.52] with caffeine it's really a powerful
[1471.44 - 1477.12] episode talk about different symptoms

[1477.12 - 1479.52] meditations though
[1478.32 - 1481.36] remember that when you do these
[1479.52 - 1483.36] meditations they actually work
[1481.36 - 1484.80] and because the meditations come from
[1483.36 - 1487.04] above okay
[1484.80 - 1488.08] they're not man-made and they come from
[1487.04 - 1490.32] above so
[1488.08 - 1492.64] they have the ability to draw that
[1490.32 - 1493.68] poison out of the soul draw that hurt
[1492.64 - 1496.00] trust break it
[1493.68 - 1497.44] trust breakage betrayal being
[1496.00 - 1499.92] backstabbed in life
[1497.44 - 1501.12] um you know all kinds of broken promises
[1499.92 - 1503.28] losses
