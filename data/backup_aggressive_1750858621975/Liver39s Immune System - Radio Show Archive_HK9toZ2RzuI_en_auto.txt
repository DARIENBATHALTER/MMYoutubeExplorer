[0.00 - 11.00] [Music]
[9.12 - 14.70] find out what's making you sick and how
[11.00 - 16.40] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[14.70 - 18.68] [Music]
[16.40 - 20.32] medium this is Anthony William the
[18.68 - 22.28] medical Medium you're listening to the
[20.32 - 23.72] medical medium radio show where each
[22.28 - 26.44] week we talk about the most advanced
[23.72 - 28.36] healing information out there ever in
[26.44 - 30.72] conventional and alternative medicine in
[28.36 - 32.24] chronic illness it's important to know
[30.72 - 34.48] that because you know we don't discuss
[32.24 - 36.32] some of the amazing discoveries in
[34.48 - 38.48] science and research with medicine
[36.32 - 39.92] life-saving medicine and everything else
[38.48 - 41.72] because we don't need to they're doing
[39.92 - 43.40] great but what we need to discuss is
[41.72 - 45.44] where it's disastrous where it's
[43.40 - 47.64] negligent where it's literally falling
[45.44 - 50.48] apart millions of people in the US alone
[47.64 - 54.16] are so sick not functioning quality of
[50.48 - 55.28] life down the drain all of it all of it
[54.16 - 56.64] and that's what we're up against with
[55.28 - 59.32] chronic illness and it's only getting
[56.64 - 61.60] worse by the Year by the month every
[59.32 - 63.24] single year every single decade been
[61.60 - 65.32] watching it happen for decades so we
[63.24 - 66.64] have to do something about it so we deal
[65.32 - 68.12] with the most advanced health
[66.64 - 71.92] information today we're talking about
[68.12 - 74.72] the liver's own immune system the
[71.92 - 77.12] liver's own immune system very important
[74.72 - 79.80] topic unbelievable science and research
[77.12 - 81.88] doesn't have a clue to the degree of how
[79.80 - 84.36] the liver's immune system works what's
[81.88 - 86.28] happening inside the liver what's going
[84.36 - 88.48] on how it's protecting you and
[86.28 - 90.20] everything about it so it's the heroic
[88.48 - 93.60] liver this is all about liver rescue
[90.20 - 95.52] live a rescue book um pick up a copy if
[93.60 - 97.44] you get a chance you can't afford a copy
[95.52 - 99.36] of a book just go to the library and try
[97.44 - 100.84] to get it out there soon as you can head
[99.36 - 103.24] to the library because you really need
[100.84 - 105.20] this and you need to get better and you
[103.24 - 107.12] need to you just need to get the
[105.20 - 110.00] information it's so important to
[107.12 - 112.68] understand your immune system that is
[110.00 - 114.12] really a critical piece I'm going to
[112.68 - 115.08] tell you something right now when you
[114.12 - 118.04] were
[115.08 - 120.72] born when you were born your mother's
[118.04 - 124.36] liver sent a message to your your own
[120.72 - 127.36] liver that it could take care of itself
[124.36 - 128.44] going back thousands of years in the
[127.36 - 131.32] history of
[128.44 - 135.64] humankind this has been ingrained in who
[131.32 - 138.76] we are as human beings this is how it's
[135.64 - 141.56] always been it's always been a part of
[138.76 - 144.00] us our livers we don't offer them a
[141.56 - 147.56] helping hand we never give them that
[144.00 - 150.04] helping hand so as we go through life
[147.56 - 152.32] they have to take care of themselves and
[150.04 - 157.04] so the knowledge has passed along from
[152.32 - 159.56] our mothers to us liver to liver that it
[157.04 - 162.24] has to fend for
[159.56 - 165.08] itself a very important understanding
[162.24 - 167.60] right there and and you know it's not
[165.08 - 170.68] that it couldn't use any help it does
[167.60 - 174.72] need our help our livs do need our help
[170.68 - 176.60] without a doubt it does face limitations
[174.72 - 180.40] over time as it weakens though and
[176.60 - 182.68] breaks down from lack of our support
[180.40 - 184.12] you know when we don't know what the
[182.68 - 185.36] liver is doing for us and don't have a
[184.12 - 186.52] clue and that's why we're talking about
[185.36 - 188.16] the liver's own immune system
[186.52 - 191.00] personalized immune system the heroic
[188.16 - 193.60] liver I call it in Liver
[191.00 - 195.84] Rescue you the reason why we're even
[193.60 - 199.56] doing this is because it's important to
[195.84 - 202.40] know about the liver's immune system and
[199.56 - 205.72] how it doesn't get outside help from us
[202.40 - 208.68] ever it needs and deserves its outside
[205.72 - 212.68] the outside help from us it really
[208.68 - 215.68] does and so as the years go by the
[212.68 - 218.32] liver's own immune system which is
[215.68 - 220.44] literally not understood by research and
[218.32 - 222.16] science except for just one basic aspect
[220.44 - 224.24] of it and I'm going to cover into detail
[222.16 - 226.84] about the the real thing that's going on
[224.24 - 229.56] inside our liver get ready to be mind
[226.84 - 231.48] blown just get ready to be mind
[229.56 - 233.52] blown and that's
[231.48 - 235.60] important all of it's important about
[233.52 - 237.44] the liver and it's important to actually
[235.60 - 239.00] be mind blown too so you can be like hey
[237.44 - 240.28] I remember that I need to take care of
[239.00 - 242.32] my liver
[240.28 - 244.64] my God I can't believe my liver does
[242.32 - 246.64] that exactly so then you can actually
[244.64 - 248.80] you can actually remember it remember
[246.64 - 251.84] the information if something's at
[248.80 - 254.72] mind-blowing like your liver has six
[251.84 - 258.84] types of immune functions meaning like
[254.72 - 261.16] six varieties of immune cells only one
[258.84 - 263.32] is flagged by research and science this
[261.16 - 265.96] is going to be a fun show it really
[263.32 - 268.24] is so as the liver loses strength and
[265.96 - 269.68] grows toxic Through The Years yes our
[268.24 - 272.16] livers grow toxic through the years
[269.68 - 276.08] years you better believe it the liver's
[272.16 - 279.32] immune system becomes a tattered Army a
[276.08 - 282.84] tattered Army out in a field in the
[279.32 - 284.12] trenches with holes in the boots and
[282.84 - 287.60] holes in
[284.12 - 290.40] socks and and tears in in the in the you
[287.60 - 291.36] know and tears in the uniforms and tears
[290.40 - 293.76] in the
[291.36 - 295.52] eyes and that's how the liver that's how
[293.76 - 298.48] the liver and it becomes desperate for
[295.52 - 301.88] food and water and it's and that's the
[298.48 - 305.72] whole point low Amun I supply low immune
[301.88 - 307.64] system and and that's the whole deal we
[305.72 - 308.80] can shift it of course we can do
[307.64 - 311.88] something about it we can build the
[308.80 - 314.12] immune system we can protect ourselves
[311.88 - 317.64] protect our liver and build our liver's
[314.12 - 319.56] immune system up there is a way but
[317.64 - 322.48] first you need to know your liver has an
[319.56 - 324.00] immune system that's the big thing this
[322.48 - 326.16] is this is revolutionary information
[324.00 - 327.52] mean it's Advanced by 10 20 30 years I
[326.16 - 328.88] don't know maybe even 40 years you know
[327.52 - 331.40] what when I'm dead down the road just
[328.88 - 334.20] gone whatever just
[331.40 - 336.72] gone you know 50 years down the road
[334.20 - 338.28] whatever it's going to be this this the
[336.72 - 339.56] you know maybe science and research will
[338.28 - 342.08] actually teach people how to take care
[339.56 - 344.44] of their livers so that this is on the
[342.08 - 346.64] radar but wait a minute we're here right
[344.44 - 348.52] now what does that matter we're here
[346.64 - 350.40] right now what am I talking about what
[348.52 - 353.12] do you mean 50 years down the road
[350.40 - 354.92] what's today right there you can know
[353.12 - 358.12] now how about that you can learn now we
[354.92 - 361.48] can learn right now as we speak yeah
[358.12 - 363.08] isn't that exciting that's really
[361.48 - 365.76] exciting
[363.08 - 367.76] so okay we can shift this of course and
[365.76 - 370.60] we can do something about it we can heal
[367.76 - 375.64] and avoid disease we can protect the
[370.60 - 378.76] liver its reserves and precious immune
[375.64 - 382.56] system we could change the direction we
[378.76 - 385.04] can not be sick and recover we can alter
[382.56 - 387.56] things we can get out of things we could
[385.04 - 390.88] change our destiny yes we can when you
[387.56 - 393.68] know what is going on and you need to
[390.88 - 398.24] do this is so important to know all of
[393.68 - 400.64] it we can change the way our liver works
[398.24 - 402.36] and our Health Works we need our livers
[400.64 - 405.56] and our livers need us I'm telling you
[402.36 - 406.96] right now and knowingness is the biggest
[405.56 - 410.76] piece of the
[406.96 - 412.00] puzzle knowingness is the biggest piece
[410.76 - 414.88] of the
[412.00 - 417.52] puzzle while medical denial can keep us
[414.88 - 420.44] in the dark we can play it
[417.52 - 422.92] smart by knowing that the liver's immune
[420.44 - 427.92] system is always kept in the light of
[422.92 - 430.28] knowing it understands our liver and it
[427.92 - 432.52] understands what it's doing but we need
[430.28 - 434.04] to help it in some way you don't think
[432.52 - 435.88] this is exciting I think this is
[434.04 - 439.48] exciting that's all I can tell you this
[435.88 - 442.40] is a big this is a big deal if you get
[439.48 - 444.60] Liver Rescue just I mean just know you
[442.40 - 447.24] the book is got so much information that
[444.60 - 448.72] it's I can't cover it in a radio show
[447.24 - 451.28] I'm talking about the liver's immune
[448.72 - 454.68] system it's actually a chapter a whole
[451.28 - 456.68] section in um in Liver Rescue but I can
[454.68 - 458.20] only scratch I guess just a couple of
[456.68 - 461.40] things in there but this is going to be
[458.20 - 463.12] still incredible if you want to know the
[461.40 - 464.72] you want to get it all you just got to
[463.12 - 466.36] make sure you go to the library get a
[464.72 - 468.32] copy if you can't afford one or just go
[466.36 - 470.12] to Amazon or whatever and get a get a
[468.32 - 472.28] book wherever you go to get a book go to
[470.12 - 474.56] the bookstore when you hear about the
[472.28 - 476.08] term immune system you guys we tend to
[474.56 - 478.04] think about our bodies like defense
[476.08 - 479.68] mechanisms with sniffles runny noses
[478.04 - 481.16] right don't you think that I mean it's
[479.68 - 482.60] the whole point and some people think
[481.16 - 484.40] cancer they think cancer now they're
[482.60 - 485.44] like immune system cancer you need a
[484.40 - 487.84] good immune system so you don't get
[485.44 - 489.68] cancer so some people are thinking that
[487.84 - 492.12] it's not a lot of people that are going
[489.68 - 495.52] there but we often think about runny
[492.12 - 496.84] noses fever sore throats coughs yeah
[495.52 - 498.84] rightfully so you don't want that you
[496.84 - 501.44] don't want the flu cuz that's what it's
[498.84 - 503.64] about you don't want the flu protection
[501.44 - 505.92] against flu is critical like it's a
[503.64 - 507.88] critical function of the immune system
[505.92 - 509.92] that's why we we learn as kids take
[507.88 - 511.72] Vitamin C I think or get a good night's
[509.92 - 514.28] rest or plenty of fluids I think mommies
[511.72 - 518.12] are teaching kids that so that's a
[514.28 - 519.68] beautiful thing um but this this this is
[518.12 - 522.00] just a fraction of what our immune
[519.68 - 523.08] system is made up of because there's all
[522.00 - 526.28] these
[523.08 - 528.04] Invaders I hate going into spooky land I
[526.28 - 529.92] hate going into spooky land but I have
[528.04 - 532.64] to there's all these
[529.92 - 534.96] Invaders there's all these viral things
[532.64 - 536.60] going on there's viruses and there's
[534.96 - 540.76] some bacteria but there's a lot of
[536.60 - 543.12] viruses that's really what's taking down
[540.76 - 545.44] people in this country alone never mind
[543.12 - 547.76] globally and making it so they can't
[545.44 - 549.52] function making it so they literally
[547.76 - 553.04] can't they can't get out of
[549.52 - 554.60] bed making it so they can brain fog
[553.04 - 556.64] giving them everything under the sun I
[554.60 - 558.40] mean brain fog Just One symptom I'm not
[556.64 - 560.64] even talking about migraines headaches
[558.40 - 562.52] Tremors shakes aches and pains tingles
[560.64 - 564.60] numbness tentis ringing in the ears
[562.52 - 566.12] popping in the ears floaters in the eyes
[564.60 - 569.20] black spots in the eyes white spots in
[566.12 - 570.96] the eyes weak limbs weak arms weak legs
[569.20 - 572.88] feeling of fatigue neurological fatigue
[570.96 - 575.32] which I actually which comes from me
[572.88 - 576.84] neurological fatigue just so you know
[575.32 - 578.80] okay it's just always been fatigue all
[576.84 - 580.60] these years it's actually neurological
[578.80 - 582.28] fatigue it's a central nervous system
[580.60 - 584.20] being bogged down by neurotoxins by
[582.28 - 585.96] viruses that's medical medium
[584.20 - 588.36] information that's Advanced information
[585.96 - 592.08] that's that's been hit in the scene from
[588.36 - 593.36] from us but the point is is that with
[592.08 - 595.04] all the different neurological
[593.36 - 596.52] conditions you can have including hot
[595.04 - 599.52] flashes which is actually a central
[596.52 - 601.28] nervous system condition all these with
[599.52 - 603.52] all these things you can
[601.28 - 605.20] have with with you know Focus
[603.52 - 608.56] concentration everything under the sun
[605.20 - 611.44] there's viruses that sit behind all of
[608.56 - 613.24] this so our immune system it's just not
[611.44 - 614.80] about the flu it's just not about that
[613.24 - 616.08] kind of thing it's not about hey you
[614.80 - 618.08] know let's let's guard ourselves from
[616.08 - 621.04] the flu let's not try to get the flu
[618.08 - 624.32] it's not it's not about that it's about
[621.04 - 625.92] so much more evidence of Invaders isn't
[624.32 - 627.44] always so obvious that's what I mean
[625.92 - 628.84] it's just not obvious to the doctors
[627.44 - 630.12] it's not obvious to anyone you even
[628.84 - 631.40] getting Epstein bar test you're not
[630.12 - 632.88] going to think your Epstein bar is even
[631.40 - 635.24] doing
[632.88 - 638.00] anything because they don't
[635.24 - 640.44] know viruses and bacteria especially
[638.00 - 643.28] viruses wage attacks beneath the surface
[640.44 - 646.88] deep in there and they don't create a
[643.28 - 649.20] lot of noise sometimes they're nice and
[646.88 - 651.24] quiet not trying to go into spooky
[649.20 - 653.44] spooky land but I I just you know it's
[651.24 - 655.84] either you you you learn or you don't I
[653.44 - 658.52] don't know what else to say I mean we
[655.84 - 661.20] can be in the dark about everything and
[658.52 - 662.80] we can be in denial I can't tell you how
[661.20 - 664.36] many people even on social media they're
[662.80 - 665.96] like oh yeah you know you see it out
[664.36 - 668.28] there and you're just like yeah I got
[665.96 - 670.20] this these symptoms and everything and
[668.28 - 672.36] they they don't even know they're viral
[670.20 - 673.76] they don't even know they're viral they
[672.36 - 676.12] have no clue they think oh it's just a
[673.76 - 677.72] gut problem Oh my gut I went to this
[676.12 - 679.36] functional doctor at whatever think a
[677.72 - 680.12] gut problem or I think I just get
[679.36 - 682.40] they're
[680.12 - 683.76] viral you know you see it there's a lot
[682.40 - 685.64] of 20-year-olds there's a lot of
[683.76 - 687.88] whatever 30y olds and they're just you
[685.64 - 689.52] know they don't know it oh yeah I got
[687.88 - 690.84] hypothyroidism they don't that that's
[689.52 - 692.32] actually Epstein bar causing
[690.84 - 694.20] hypothyroidism you see it out there it's
[692.32 - 696.92] unbelievable how far we're still off
[694.20 - 698.80] about getting the information out there
[696.92 - 701.76] but these viruses they just sit in there
[698.80 - 705.60] so viruses bacteria they wage attacks
[701.76 - 708.56] far beneath the surface in organs and
[705.60 - 710.88] glands you know that's how it works
[708.56 - 713.08] fibromyalgia you know multiple sclerosis
[710.88 - 716.48] rheumatoid arthritis you know you know
[713.08 - 717.80] ra you know myalgic contis all kinds of
[716.48 - 720.12] different things chronic fatigue
[717.80 - 722.84] syndrome MEC CFS
[720.12 - 725.32] right you know lupus shingles Lyme
[722.84 - 728.08] disease hashimotos thyroiditis
[725.32 - 730.32] hypothyroidism and add another hundred
[728.08 - 734.48] other conditions to
[730.32 - 737.20] it are all from a virus starting out in
[734.48 - 741.36] guess where guess where just make a
[737.20 - 743.28] guess right now um Liver Rescue book um
[741.36 - 745.52] talking about the liver's immune system
[743.28 - 747.12] where do all those conditions where do
[745.52 - 749.20] they all stem from where do they all
[747.12 - 752.88] start from right you you're figuring it
[749.20 - 754.40] out I mean you know probably bunch of
[752.88 - 756.04] you guys want to smack me in the head
[754.40 - 760.08] right now probably be like we got it
[756.04 - 763.28] it's the liver stop we got
[760.08 - 766.96] it yeah it's the liver it stems there it
[763.28 - 769.24] starts there that's where it starts more
[766.96 - 772.56] than we know we rely on the liver's
[769.24 - 774.72] immune system so much so it's it's
[772.56 - 776.36] unbelievable how we rely on the liver's
[774.72 - 779.88] immune
[776.36 - 781.84] system it's unbelievable actually
[779.88 - 784.04] and it protects us from becoming ill the
[781.84 - 786.64] liver doesn't like viruses and it
[784.04 - 790.32] doesn't like bacteria either residing in
[786.64 - 793.28] it so when it can't stop them from
[790.32 - 794.96] entering it does everything it can to
[793.28 - 797.76] keep them
[794.96 - 800.28] contained so viruses enter into the
[797.76 - 803.56] liver that's how it's
[800.28 - 805.76] done they enter into the liver and if
[803.56 - 808.56] the liver can't stop it if the liver's
[805.76 - 810.04] immune system cannot kill off that bug
[808.56 - 811.40] cuz the liver's immune system is weak
[810.04 - 813.92] because guess what we're on high fat
[811.40 - 815.28] diets all fun in games all those cute
[813.92 - 816.84] little trendy diets out there I talk
[815.28 - 818.16] about that in Liver Rescue more than you
[816.84 - 819.96] guys could ever know I mean wait till
[818.16 - 822.68] you see it wait till you see it you
[819.96 - 825.72] won't believe it all the trendy diets
[822.68 - 827.88] out there all high fat diets keep on
[825.72 - 829.44] doing it keep on putting out more high
[827.88 - 830.64] fat diets high protein diets keep on
[829.44 - 832.48] doing it I'm not talking about whether
[830.64 - 833.96] it's animal protein or vegan they're
[832.48 - 835.48] they're both they go but they both go
[833.96 - 838.56] high protein high
[835.48 - 839.80] fat let's keep on doing it out there
[838.56 - 841.56] yeah you're going to get temporary
[839.80 - 842.84] results for many of you but yet
[841.56 - 846.20] everybody's still going to stay sick
[842.84 - 848.12] down the road I mean you know it's
[846.20 - 850.24] unbelievable you got to bring down the
[848.12 - 852.36] fats it weakens the liver so the liver's
[850.24 - 854.20] immune system cannot stop viral
[852.36 - 855.60] infections at a chronic long term so
[854.20 - 857.76] that when you're and when you're in your
[855.60 - 859.52] 20s and you think you're indestructible
[857.76 - 861.48] and you're in the gym right and you're
[859.52 - 864.72] on your trendy low carb
[861.48 - 867.12] diet give it 20 years give it to when
[864.72 - 869.16] you're 40 40 comes around man it comes
[867.12 - 871.04] around and when you're sick you got all
[869.16 - 872.88] these symptoms and craps happening left
[871.04 - 874.48] and right it's got two viruses inside
[872.88 - 876.88] the liver and no one cared and no one
[874.48 - 878.44] even knows and no one wants to know and
[876.88 - 880.08] and whatever's going on and it's just
[878.44 - 881.68] you know wreaking havoc and then coming
[880.08 - 883.00] out and hitting the thyroid and giving
[881.68 - 884.64] you your first case of Hashimoto
[883.00 - 886.12] thyroiditis and and everything else
[884.64 - 888.56] Under the
[886.12 - 890.00] Sun and you're gaining weight and don't
[888.56 - 892.88] know why you've been working out eating
[890.00 - 895.20] good pretty good all these years because
[892.88 - 897.76] nobody knows how it works it's
[895.20 - 899.44] unbelievable look it's either you you
[897.76 - 901.40] know or you don't
[899.44 - 903.28] I could I could stop the radio shows I
[901.40 - 905.68] could stop putting out the books I mean
[903.28 - 908.32] should I maybe I should maybe I should
[905.68 - 911.48] shut it all down all of it I'll just go
[908.32 - 912.40] find some wooded spot and live in a in
[911.48 - 914.40] in a
[912.40 - 916.72] tent
[914.40 - 919.24] somewhere maybe I'll do that I did it
[916.72 - 919.24] when I was a
[920.20 - 924.24] kid okay so let's do Let's do let's do
[922.96 - 926.04] this let's do this I'm being pretty
[924.24 - 929.04] silly I'm in a silly mood
[926.04 - 931.72] today so the bottom line is the livers
[929.04 - 934.16] get beaten down we rely on them liver's
[931.72 - 936.96] immune system more than we can possibly
[934.16 - 939.44] imagine and when the liver can't kill
[936.96 - 942.48] off because it's been weakened over time
[939.44 - 944.64] and over the years by the wrong diets
[942.48 - 946.36] because of just experts not knowing
[944.64 - 948.84] anything about how the body works and
[946.36 - 951.00] all these other things when when when
[948.84 - 952.52] we're under all this stuff or we're
[951.00 - 954.80] Contracting viruses through
[952.52 - 956.36] relationships or however it goes and all
[954.80 - 958.64] these different things that it that we
[956.36 - 960.88] get it we get these viruses from and
[958.64 - 963.96] from food and restaurants and everything
[960.88 - 966.16] else our liver has to work on destroying
[963.96 - 969.04] it its immune system has to be strong
[966.16 - 971.80] and it has to be able to annihilate a
[969.04 - 973.52] bug entering it cuz that's what happens
[971.80 - 976.72] when you're new relationships all the
[973.52 - 978.68] time the bugs they get in the mouth and
[976.72 - 980.60] they get down to the gut and then they
[978.68 - 982.48] transfer from the gut up the hepatic
[980.60 - 984.80] portal highway right into the liver
[982.48 - 987.52] that's how it's
[984.80 - 989.24] done I mean that's just one way in a
[987.52 - 992.00] relationship
[989.24 - 994.16] you know there's a few other ways in a
[992.00 - 996.08] relationship that it could happen too
[994.16 - 998.36] but the point is is this is what what
[996.08 - 1001.48] goes on you get in a restaurant you got
[998.36 - 1002.72] all these chefs I mean cross the country
[1001.48 - 1004.20] and there's nothing wrong with chefs
[1002.72 - 1007.04] it's just their people which just means
[1004.20 - 1009.00] you got all these people and and they
[1007.04 - 1010.72] got Band-Aids on their hands and they
[1009.00 - 1014.04] got you know all kinds of stuff I mean
[1010.72 - 1015.56] it's unbelievable and yeah they get cut
[1014.04 - 1017.80] and they're still got to work you just
[1015.56 - 1021.24] got to wrap it up I've seen I've seen
[1017.80 - 1022.84] chefs some of the the best chefs get cut
[1021.24 - 1024.40] and they just throw electrical tape on
[1022.84 - 1025.96] it on it they just wrap it with
[1024.40 - 1029.08] electrical
[1025.96 - 1032.36] tape and and throw on yeah they throw on
[1029.08 - 1033.48] sometimes a a nit trial glove but at the
[1032.36 - 1034.68] same time they still got blood
[1033.48 - 1036.36] everywhere and on their hands and they
[1034.68 - 1038.04] throw on the Nitro nit trial glove
[1036.36 - 1039.16] there's blood on their nit trial glove
[1038.04 - 1040.92] but they're still I mean they're trying
[1039.16 - 1042.24] to whatever and they throw wrap
[1040.92 - 1044.52] electrical tape and they're in they're
[1042.24 - 1046.04] In the Heat of the Moment of just trying
[1044.52 - 1047.20] to get the food out I mean it's it's
[1046.04 - 1050.40] like one of those High pressured
[1047.20 - 1050.40] situations stel
[1050.56 - 1054.96] and then boom I mean we're eating food
[1052.48 - 1056.68] and just got another Epstein bar don't
[1054.96 - 1059.12] know why we got chronic fatigue
[1056.68 - 1062.12] syndrome again at age
[1059.12 - 1064.04] 38 either way I'm not trying to scare
[1062.12 - 1067.20] the crap out of us too bad basically
[1064.04 - 1071.08] what I'm doing is the liver it's up to
[1067.20 - 1075.92] the liver it's so up to the liver it's
[1071.08 - 1079.12] so up to the liver to make sure it
[1075.92 - 1082.80] destroys a new bug coming
[1079.12 - 1085.64] in and if it can't destroy it it locks
[1082.80 - 1090.76] it up it imprisons
[1085.64 - 1093.24] it it imprisons it the liver is a
[1090.76 - 1095.32] genius it's the
[1093.24 - 1098.52] gatekeeper it's
[1095.32 - 1101.20] everything it's underestimated it's
[1098.52 - 1104.80] disrespected it's disregarded it's
[1101.20 - 1107.32] treated badly just like people are
[1104.80 - 1109.36] treated by the
[1107.32 - 1113.08] way it's
[1109.36 - 1116.96] used it's like people get used it's
[1113.08 - 1120.52] terrible it's all of it and we need to
[1116.96 - 1122.80] do something about it we need to do
[1120.52 - 1124.88] something so it kind of works like this
[1122.80 - 1126.52] let's go into us this is really intense
[1124.88 - 1129.56] so I mean get
[1126.52 - 1133.44] your you know get yourself ready for
[1129.56 - 1136.08] this one so here's here's the
[1133.44 - 1138.32] deal the liver
[1136.08 - 1140.84] contains whatever it can that's possible
[1138.32 - 1145.60] possible then it will send killer
[1140.84 - 1149.24] cells after viruses to keep them at
[1145.60 - 1152.24] Bay and they keep them deep guarded in
[1149.24 - 1154.28] the fabric of the liver so basically
[1152.24 - 1155.60] what these killer cells this is just one
[1154.28 - 1158.16] set of killer cells wait till you hear
[1155.60 - 1160.96] the rest of this and that's just to keep
[1158.16 - 1163.24] it at Bay inside the
[1160.96 - 1166.60] liver and this is really important to
[1163.24 - 1169.44] know when a virus starts to get out of
[1166.60 - 1171.28] control it tries to to leave the depths
[1169.44 - 1174.12] of the liver that it's been shoved down
[1171.28 - 1176.00] and stored in locked up tries to leave
[1174.12 - 1179.20] the depths of the
[1176.00 - 1182.52] liver special white blood cells are
[1179.20 - 1186.20] there to destroy it a different variety
[1182.52 - 1186.20] all on its own a different
[1186.28 - 1190.36] variety the liver also brings in white
[1188.72 - 1193.68] blood cells
[1190.36 - 1195.92] randomly to control viruses living deep
[1193.68 - 1198.52] within it like I was saying
[1195.92 - 1202.40] before but why doesn't the liver send
[1198.52 - 1204.24] its white count to out and out destroy
[1202.40 - 1207.08] all viruses and other pathogens in the
[1204.24 - 1209.56] liver why doesn't it do
[1207.08 - 1212.68] that because the liver is putting
[1209.56 - 1214.88] tremendous number of resources already
[1212.68 - 1219.08] into trying to fight off new pathogens
[1214.88 - 1221.32] entering by the second by the day by the
[1219.08 - 1223.92] week by the
[1221.32 - 1225.96] month through the hepatic portal vein
[1223.92 - 1229.00] which and and hepatic artery these are
[1225.96 - 1231.60] entries into the liver and it's trying
[1229.00 - 1235.52] to kill those off as they
[1231.60 - 1238.16] enter the liver gets
[1235.52 - 1240.68] exhausted so it's trying to kill off
[1238.16 - 1243.52] Invaders entering in in the first place
[1240.68 - 1245.76] as it's using all of its reserves to try
[1243.52 - 1248.12] to stop viruses entering into the
[1245.76 - 1250.64] paddock portal vein and Paddock artery
[1248.12 - 1251.80] the highways into the into the liver
[1250.64 - 1253.84] that's where all the viruses are
[1251.80 - 1255.20] entering that's where they all come in
[1253.84 - 1256.80] and your liver's immune system is
[1255.20 - 1259.32] sitting there at those
[1256.80 - 1261.52] gates at the the gates of that highway
[1259.32 - 1265.36] right there trying to annihilate
[1261.52 - 1267.04] everything that comes in everything so
[1265.36 - 1268.72] when you're at you're at a cocktail
[1267.04 - 1270.16] party when you're at a bar or a club and
[1268.72 - 1271.84] you get you drinking out of dirty
[1270.16 - 1273.20] glasses and whatever and sharing drinks
[1271.84 - 1274.64] and whatever's going on and all of a
[1273.20 - 1276.08] sudden you just picked up a new kind of
[1274.64 - 1277.84] strep and that strep goes right in the
[1276.08 - 1279.20] gut hasn't really prospered or done
[1277.84 - 1281.36] anything yet but it goes right down in
[1279.20 - 1282.64] the gut heads right down in there goes
[1281.36 - 1284.40] right through the wall of the intestinal
[1282.64 - 1286.84] tract lining that's how it does it goes
[1284.40 - 1290.40] through the wall it literally through
[1286.84 - 1292.84] osmosis gets vacuumed through right up
[1290.40 - 1295.32] theor hortal veins right through blood
[1292.84 - 1298.04] vessels right up to the liver and that
[1295.32 - 1299.76] liver of yours sits there with it all
[1298.04 - 1301.92] its immune strength and all its immune
[1299.76 - 1304.80] system sitting there waiting by the
[1301.92 - 1306.60] gates and annihilates the crap out of
[1304.80 - 1308.96] that that brand new strep you just
[1306.60 - 1311.20] picked up in that club or at the
[1308.96 - 1312.92] cocktail party or at your friend's house
[1311.20 - 1314.32] or whatever I'm just just you know I
[1312.92 - 1317.16] don't know I don't know what people do
[1314.32 - 1319.28] these days wherever wherever we can get
[1317.16 - 1322.12] anything
[1319.28 - 1324.68] or you know or the toilet or some toilet
[1322.12 - 1327.44] in some gas station that was just you
[1324.68 - 1331.80] know festering with a whole bunch of
[1327.44 - 1334.72] stuff and some water splashed up yeah
[1331.80 - 1336.64] and you know and with that and with that
[1334.72 - 1339.68] your liver is literally destroying that
[1336.64 - 1341.52] Invader so it's using everything it can
[1339.68 - 1345.36] everything it
[1341.52 - 1347.56] can I told you this was going to be
[1345.36 - 1349.64] intense all right let's cruise along we
[1347.56 - 1351.60] got so much to cover it's
[1349.64 - 1353.08] ridiculous because the liver is already
[1351.60 - 1355.12] putting out like I said there tremendous
[1353.08 - 1357.76] number of resources to trying to do what
[1355.12 - 1359.52] exactly what I just said it's doing
[1357.76 - 1361.88] protect things from entering into the
[1359.52 - 1364.00] portal vein a portal he hepatic artery
[1361.88 - 1365.12] all of that and if you don't know what
[1364.00 - 1366.64] that is that's just you know that's
[1365.12 - 1367.60] veins coming off of your intestinal
[1366.64 - 1371.04] tract
[1367.60 - 1374.84] lining that's veins and they all funnel
[1371.04 - 1376.08] to the liver into a main Highway hepatic
[1374.84 - 1378.20] portal
[1376.08 - 1380.36] Highway same thing with arteries the
[1378.20 - 1383.20] artery all the blood vessels all to a
[1380.36 - 1385.76] main artery a a
[1383.20 - 1388.56] highway so that's what the body is doing
[1385.76 - 1390.52] is trying to kill those off these are
[1388.56 - 1392.48] the immune defenses of the liver the
[1390.52 - 1394.08] liver's personalized immune system
[1392.48 - 1396.00] that's what this show is about it's a
[1394.08 - 1398.36] highly Advanced information for warning
[1396.00 - 1400.24] anybody who just tuned in and listen to
[1398.36 - 1403.08] the show over again you got to listen to
[1400.24 - 1405.00] the show over again I think you know
[1403.08 - 1406.56] honestly it's it's it's a shame when
[1405.00 - 1408.64] someone just Tunes in halfway in the
[1406.56 - 1410.76] show doesn't hear the first half I know
[1408.64 - 1412.76] we're all busy but this is about your
[1410.76 - 1415.20] health loved ones and everything else
[1412.76 - 1417.56] and it's about knowing some important
[1415.20 - 1419.36] information much of the sophistication
[1417.56 - 1420.76] of the liver's immune system is still
[1419.36 - 1422.64] unknown like I said to Medical
[1420.76 - 1424.20] communities research and science it's
[1422.64 - 1426.00] why you don't hear about it every day in
[1424.20 - 1429.36] the world that's the whole
[1426.00 - 1431.32] point almost all of it's not known and
[1429.36 - 1433.88] that's how it
[1431.32 - 1435.32] works and and it's unknown to medical
[1433.88 - 1438.08] science and research that your liver's
[1435.32 - 1443.16] immune system is made up ready of six
[1438.08 - 1446.08] main units your liver immune system is
[1443.16 - 1448.24] made up of six main
[1446.08 - 1450.88] units I'll give you three of them right
[1448.24 - 1453.92] off the top the hepatic vessel white
[1450.88 - 1455.88] blood cells okay hepatic portal vein
[1453.92 - 1458.24] white blood cells science of research
[1455.88 - 1460.08] doesn't know about this has no clue
[1458.24 - 1461.56] these aren't even not even on the radar
[1460.08 - 1463.60] not even in any study not even in
[1461.56 - 1466.80] anywhere it's Advanced information for
[1463.60 - 1469.60] warning you hepatic artery white blood
[1466.80 - 1471.68] cells those are three of those units I
[1469.60 - 1474.40] just said just now they're the soldiers
[1471.68 - 1477.28] that stand watch they stand watch as the
[1474.40 - 1478.48] blood enters the liver research and
[1477.28 - 1479.88] science just thinks there's some white
[1478.48 - 1481.12] blood cells floating around inside the
[1479.88 - 1484.88] liver that's about
[1481.12 - 1486.36] it that's about it and there's a reason
[1484.88 - 1487.60] I really think there's a reason money's
[1486.36 - 1489.12] not going there and I really think
[1487.60 - 1490.52] there's a reason why it's understudied
[1489.12 - 1492.08] like everything else in chronic illness
[1490.52 - 1494.08] but I think with this one I think
[1492.08 - 1495.72] there's a big reason because once again
[1494.08 - 1497.92] it leads to the fact that the liver is
[1495.72 - 1499.24] filled with viruses and and then virus
[1497.92 - 1500.68] Es are the cause for all the chronic
[1499.24 - 1506.12] illnesses and guess what it's not
[1500.68 - 1506.12] genetics it's not genetics it never was
[1506.40 - 1510.12] genetics that why people are sick with
[1508.52 - 1513.04] chronic illness it's not the body
[1510.12 - 1518.00] attacking itself it's a it's a
[1513.04 - 1520.00] liver filled with a load of viruses try
[1518.00 - 1522.68] to bleep myself and not
[1520.00 - 1525.64] swear cuz this stuff will just you know
[1522.68 - 1528.52] it'll it'll make you get emotional and
[1525.64 - 1529.96] the whole point is is that you know that
[1528.52 - 1531.68] we're not supposed to know about like
[1529.96 - 1533.08] how viruses make us all sick we're
[1531.68 - 1534.76] supposed to kind of stay stupid and then
[1533.08 - 1537.56] we get an answer or diagnosis we're like
[1534.76 - 1540.12] what our body's attacking itself our
[1537.56 - 1541.96] body is actually attacking itself so my
[1540.12 - 1544.32] body's own immune system is destroying
[1541.96 - 1546.32] my thyroid or my body's own immune
[1544.32 - 1548.72] system is destroying my skin or
[1546.32 - 1551.20] destroying my kidney or my body's own
[1548.72 - 1553.76] immune system is making me sick is okay
[1551.20 - 1555.36] and and it's genetic oh wait wait
[1553.76 - 1557.68] there's information out there now you're
[1555.36 - 1559.48] telling me that Epstein bar kind of
[1557.68 - 1561.24] plays a role but it's not the cause it's
[1559.48 - 1562.80] just a trigger that's another screw up
[1561.24 - 1564.76] just look out for all that you see all
[1562.80 - 1566.44] these you know these studies and in the
[1564.76 - 1569.44] medical medium Community will actually
[1566.44 - 1571.32] post them and be like hey look aw was
[1569.44 - 1573.36] right Anthony William was right it is
[1571.32 - 1575.16] Epstein bar but when you read the study
[1573.36 - 1576.80] they still don't want the truth they're
[1575.16 - 1578.00] trying to derail you and trick you
[1576.80 - 1580.28] that's the whole thing I talked about
[1578.00 - 1582.36] that on a Facebook live they they're
[1580.28 - 1584.60] doing that because of what we did we
[1582.36 - 1587.12] spent years getting the truth out there
[1584.60 - 1588.64] and it became a storm it it's raging
[1587.12 - 1590.16] through the country alone never mind
[1588.64 - 1591.32] globally of the truth that's causing
[1590.16 - 1593.56] chronic illness because of the medical
[1591.32 - 1595.80] medium book series so then they put out
[1593.56 - 1598.16] the bogus studies saying oh well epsteen
[1595.80 - 1599.60] bar oh it cause of Hashim Motors cause
[1598.16 - 1601.76] of this cause no it's not the thing you
[1599.60 - 1603.40] read the article or the or or the
[1601.76 - 1604.76] article or you read the study it has
[1603.40 - 1606.24] nothing to do with the cause they say
[1604.76 - 1607.80] it's genetics and the body's attacking
[1606.24 - 1610.88] itself and they say that it's just
[1607.80 - 1614.00] linked it's it's a trigger they think
[1610.88 - 1615.92] unbelievable they do that on purpose
[1614.00 - 1619.56] that's all done on purpose don't get
[1615.92 - 1621.56] fooled by that the truth still isn't
[1619.56 - 1623.64] still isn't they they don't want you to
[1621.56 - 1625.76] know the truth it's the way it works and
[1623.64 - 1627.96] the liver has so much to do so much to
[1625.76 - 1629.48] do with it so research research and
[1627.96 - 1631.20] science is behind with the liver for a
[1629.48 - 1634.52] couple of reasons because it's the
[1631.20 - 1637.56] incubation place where all the viruses
[1634.52 - 1639.16] go and a lot of viruses are manufactured
[1637.56 - 1641.88] going all the way
[1639.16 - 1644.52] back and they've somehow
[1641.88 - 1645.84] escaped many of them stealth viruses
[1644.52 - 1648.44] many of the different varieties and the
[1645.84 - 1650.64] mutation somehow escaped out some lab
[1648.44 - 1652.16] whoa I don't know how they end up in
[1650.64 - 1655.20] people but they
[1652.16 - 1656.84] do and they incubate inside everybody's
[1655.20 - 1659.56] liver no one's taking care of the liver
[1656.84 - 1661.60] and then oh the big the big trendy the
[1659.56 - 1662.76] trendy guys out there the big fancy
[1661.60 - 1663.92] doctors whatever they put out their
[1662.76 - 1665.12] books whatever and they want to hang
[1663.92 - 1667.56] their hat on something it's all on a
[1665.12 - 1669.44] high fat this and a high fat that or a
[1667.56 - 1670.88] high protein this and you can see some
[1669.44 - 1671.76] of them are trying to back down that
[1670.88 - 1673.40] that little bit and they're like
[1671.76 - 1674.52] lowering that bringing in more juices
[1673.40 - 1676.60] bringing in more fruits and vegetables
[1674.52 - 1678.16] oh when did you learn that last year how
[1676.60 - 1679.96] about 30 years ago when I was getting
[1678.16 - 1682.08] people out of bed that were out of
[1679.96 - 1684.48] wheelchairs it's important to know what
[1682.08 - 1686.32] you need to do it's so critical so
[1684.48 - 1688.12] sarcastic today I'm sorry guys I hope
[1686.32 - 1691.20] that doesn't turn you off and make you
[1688.12 - 1693.68] want to hang up from the
[1691.20 - 1695.84] podcast here's the
[1693.68 - 1697.84] deal you just got to you just got to
[1695.84 - 1700.16] remember I'm silly too a lot so just
[1697.84 - 1702.12] just just bear with me when you're doing
[1700.16 - 1703.92] this for like your whole life since Age
[1702.12 - 1705.44] 4 you just you got to remember the
[1703.92 - 1707.68] medical information that came to me at
[1705.44 - 1709.36] age 4567 is the same thing you're
[1707.68 - 1710.96] reading in these Advanced books it's 50
[1709.36 - 1714.84] years 30 years 20 years 10 years ahead
[1710.96 - 1716.40] of its time at age 5 6 7 8 I was getting
[1714.84 - 1718.36] the
[1716.40 - 1720.56] information that's why there's this
[1718.36 - 1724.20] picture of me in the book age four years
[1720.56 - 1726.24] old sitting in there there's a reason I
[1724.20 - 1730.60] was getting the information that early
[1726.24 - 1734.84] it was no fun so there's these six six
[1730.60 - 1736.68] main units of our liver's immune system
[1734.84 - 1739.04] so here's how it works like the padic
[1736.68 - 1740.56] portal vein that's the main Highway vein
[1739.04 - 1742.52] I was talking about it comes off of the
[1740.56 - 1744.84] intestinal tract so as viruses and
[1742.52 - 1746.68] bacteria are funneling up into the liver
[1744.84 - 1748.60] those white blood cells in the hepatic
[1746.68 - 1750.84] portal vein that's one of the highways
[1748.60 - 1753.48] those white blood cells monitor the
[1750.84 - 1756.32] portal vein itself this is the main
[1753.48 - 1759.00] Highway into the liver this is past the
[1756.32 - 1761.12] point of any more off ramps or on ramps
[1759.00 - 1764.68] actually on ramps sorry about that
[1761.12 - 1766.40] there's no more exits this highway ends
[1764.68 - 1768.80] up heading did you ever did you ever get
[1766.40 - 1770.64] in traffic did you ever drive and you're
[1768.80 - 1773.32] like crap I should have gotten off of
[1770.64 - 1774.68] that you should have got off in in La
[1773.32 - 1776.80] especially in La it's like I should have
[1774.68 - 1779.28] gotten off that exit oh my God what did
[1776.80 - 1781.32] I do why am I stuck in this for the next
[1779.28 - 1783.88] 45 minutes now for the next hour and a
[1781.32 - 1785.96] half I should have got off that exit or
[1783.88 - 1789.60] in New York or wherever I mean it's just
[1785.96 - 1791.72] crazy or anywhere in the country so so
[1789.60 - 1793.36] there's no getting off that that that
[1791.72 - 1796.08] that blood is heading up into the liver
[1793.36 - 1798.12] through that hepatic portal portal vein
[1796.08 - 1802.20] so these white blood cells
[1798.12 - 1803.96] they stay they actually act like TSA TSA
[1802.20 - 1806.56] at the airport that's what they do as
[1803.96 - 1810.92] blood's coming through the hepatic
[1806.56 - 1812.64] portal vein it's filled with nutrients
[1810.92 - 1813.88] right you know that part I think our
[1812.64 - 1815.40] blood is filled with nutrients I think
[1813.88 - 1816.72] you guys probably know that there blood
[1815.40 - 1820.76] going into the liers filled with
[1816.72 - 1823.72] nutrients and poisons lots of poisons
[1820.76 - 1825.68] it's filled with both and this is a hot
[1823.72 - 1827.36] spot for any kind of troublemakers
[1825.68 - 1829.04] trying to make their way inside the
[1827.36 - 1832.48] liver like
[1829.04 - 1834.96] viruses so they try to actually go in
[1832.48 - 1837.76] through that way and the more poison you
[1834.96 - 1840.52] have coming in the more your white blood
[1837.76 - 1842.64] cells this one part of the six main
[1840.52 - 1845.88] units of your immune system can get
[1842.64 - 1848.76] derailed as an EBV a new
[1845.88 - 1851.48] EBV is is heading up through the hepatic
[1848.76 - 1854.00] portal vein exactly ready to give
[1851.48 - 1855.40] somebody a good chronic fatigue syndrome
[1854.00 - 1858.56] I mean you know so right when it's
[1855.40 - 1860.84] heading up there your white blood cells
[1858.56 - 1862.60] so that's one of the troublemakers there
[1860.84 - 1865.32] right so it's a troublemaker that virus
[1862.60 - 1867.80] very common Troublemaker unbelievable so
[1865.32 - 1870.84] it heads up and it comes and here's the
[1867.80 - 1873.08] thing so all this blood coming through
[1870.84 - 1875.64] is coming from your digestive tract it's
[1873.08 - 1878.04] unfiltered it's unfiltered the liver has
[1875.64 - 1879.64] to filter it so whatever you're eating
[1878.04 - 1881.80] whatever you're eating if you're eating
[1879.64 - 1883.16] a high high fat diet which people don't
[1881.80 - 1885.36] know they are but they really are they
[1883.16 - 1886.80] really are vegans too vegans plant-based
[1885.36 - 1889.72] people eating such high fat diets
[1886.80 - 1892.08] unbeliev able it's like everything has
[1889.72 - 1894.68] just lots of fat in it nut fat in there
[1892.08 - 1896.44] whatever kind of fat in there it's it's
[1894.68 - 1899.28] incredible vegetarians are really on
[1896.44 - 1900.96] high fat diets they're eating eggs
[1899.28 - 1903.60] vegetarians are eating
[1900.96 - 1904.84] eggs I mean it's unbelievable and so
[1903.60 - 1906.56] they're eating all that high fat
[1904.84 - 1909.04] everything else around it and and you
[1906.56 - 1911.96] know a lot of Keto diets now based based
[1909.04 - 1914.16] with eggs and then avocados and then and
[1911.96 - 1916.04] they're vegan you know or or or you know
[1914.16 - 1919.52] they kind of borderline vegan or
[1916.04 - 1921.56] whatever it is they get vegan keto diets
[1919.52 - 1923.68] it's just all fat the thing is you can't
[1921.56 - 1925.64] be on the vegan keto diet can't exist
[1923.68 - 1927.16] because an avocado has sugar in it it's
[1925.64 - 1930.80] different when you go on a animal
[1927.16 - 1933.68] protein keto diet that is an actual real
[1930.80 - 1936.88] keto diet if you if you there's no such
[1933.68 - 1939.56] thing as going on a vegan keto diet you
[1936.88 - 1941.64] can't they're sugar and nuts they're
[1939.56 - 1943.20] sugar and nuts you can't be on a keto
[1941.64 - 1946.08] diet all you can be on is just a high
[1943.20 - 1948.52] fat diet when when you're vegan fancy
[1946.08 - 1952.36] that see that
[1948.52 - 1956.12] information so because avocados it's 25%
[1952.36 - 1958.40] sugar I mean you can't you can't nuts
[1956.12 - 1960.88] there's a percentage of sugar in there
[1958.40 - 1963.72] so you really can't go
[1960.88 - 1965.72] keto um on a vegan diet you just go high
[1963.72 - 1967.76] fat with still some sugar so this you
[1965.72 - 1969.72] don't get the ketosis Factor you just
[1967.76 - 1971.44] high fat diet and you're cutting down
[1969.72 - 1973.76] your carbs that's about
[1971.44 - 1976.32] it and then the animal
[1973.76 - 1977.56] protein if you're doing avocados along
[1976.32 - 1979.24] with your animal prote proteins you're
[1977.56 - 1981.48] still not even really doing keto anymore
[1979.24 - 1983.28] anyway either you're just doing high fat
[1981.48 - 1985.00] so the whole keto thing is a bomb it's
[1983.28 - 1986.48] not even understood right and then you
[1985.00 - 1988.32] got these experts teaching it I don't
[1986.48 - 1991.80] even know how it works it's the craziest
[1988.32 - 1993.64] thing ever it's crazy it's like whoa
[1991.80 - 1995.00] it's amazing it's a wild west you can do
[1993.64 - 1997.28] anything you can do anything now in
[1995.00 - 1999.32] alternative medicine and diets in the
[1997.28 - 2001.68] diet world you can do anything can put a
[1999.32 - 2003.88] bunny rabbit in your hat and then just
[2001.68 - 2005.84] and do a funny dance with a cane and
[2003.88 - 2008.20] then show up another trendy diet in one
[2005.84 - 2010.36] second boom here's another one oh I'm an
[2008.20 - 2012.80] expert and then someone's you know on
[2010.36 - 2014.68] another diet and oh I'm Doctor whatever
[2012.80 - 2017.16] do little and this is this is what I got
[2014.68 - 2019.72] now I used to be you know a doctor and I
[2017.16 - 2021.88] used to be this and this and this at you
[2019.72 - 2023.20] know Prestige prestigious medical school
[2021.88 - 2024.80] and everything else now I'm into health
[2023.20 - 2026.64] and yeah the keto diet's the way to go
[2024.80 - 2028.76] you lose a little weight lower your
[2026.64 - 2031.24] carbs what about everybody that's dying
[2028.76 - 2033.32] of chronic illness and all the viruses
[2031.24 - 2034.80] that are eating up their bodies and
[2033.32 - 2036.08] their livers and their immune systems
[2034.80 - 2037.32] and they can't function and they can't
[2036.08 - 2038.36] even do anything they can't can't work
[2037.32 - 2040.20] they lose everything they lose
[2038.36 - 2042.28] everything in their lives and and that
[2040.20 - 2043.60] diet ain't going to help got to have the
[2042.28 - 2045.28] you got to have the truth in your hand
[2043.60 - 2048.24] so you can
[2045.28 - 2050.32] heal so you know these six main units
[2048.24 - 2052.92] one of them is there is waiting at the
[2050.32 - 2055.28] portal gate right there it's waiting a
[2052.92 - 2056.84] stomp on a bacteria and a virus that's
[2055.28 - 2059.20] creating all the illness that's going on
[2056.84 - 2061.16] out there but there's so much poison and
[2059.20 - 2062.60] there's so many nutrients all combined
[2061.16 - 2065.12] coming up that highway from your
[2062.60 - 2068.00] intestinal tract unfiltered that can get
[2065.12 - 2070.36] derailed pretty easy so that's how it
[2068.00 - 2071.44] works and that's that's really a
[2070.36 - 2073.60] difficult
[2071.44 - 2075.32] situation and then there's hepatic
[2073.60 - 2077.56] artery white blood cells that's a whole
[2075.32 - 2079.88] another kind so that's your that's
[2077.56 - 2083.44] another group hepatic
[2079.88 - 2085.92] artery white blood cells okay so they're
[2083.44 - 2088.04] in these these artery white blood cells
[2085.92 - 2089.72] this is where blood is coming in with
[2088.04 - 2091.96] high oxygen level so you have to know
[2089.72 - 2094.32] the difference so with the hepatic
[2091.96 - 2096.48] portal vein blood coming in from the
[2094.32 - 2098.00] digestive tract there's no oxygen in it
[2096.48 - 2101.28] I mean there's a little bit in there not
[2098.00 - 2105.44] a lot and and then you got and the
[2101.28 - 2105.44] stream is slow it's like
[2105.48 - 2113.64] slow the stream is not fast at all it's
[2109.36 - 2115.64] slow so the hepatic the hepatic artery
[2113.64 - 2118.92] those white blood cells they're
[2115.64 - 2121.64] stationed at the C circulatory entrance
[2118.92 - 2124.04] to the liver this is hepatic artery this
[2121.64 - 2127.00] is different this blood is coming to the
[2124.04 - 2130.08] heart coming from the heart it is higher
[2127.00 - 2131.76] levels of oxygen it's holding and then
[2130.08 - 2134.76] the blood that enters from the hepatic
[2131.76 - 2136.92] portal vein it's traveling at a higher
[2134.76 - 2138.40] velocity than than that I mean you have
[2136.92 - 2140.28] to know this this is the big difference
[2138.40 - 2143.80] right here if I'm if I'm trying to
[2140.28 - 2146.32] trying to remember trying to
[2143.80 - 2149.44] remember so it's hepatic artery white
[2146.32 - 2151.96] blood cells they're different they're
[2149.44 - 2153.84] adapted to a whole different situation
[2151.96 - 2155.40] cuz you remember high levels of oxygen
[2153.84 - 2157.84] pouring into the
[2155.40 - 2159.76] liver that blood's being pumped from the
[2157.84 - 2161.68] heart this isn't blood coming from the
[2159.76 - 2163.40] digestive tract being sucked in through
[2161.68 - 2166.20] the veins up into the liver I was
[2163.40 - 2170.16] talking about before this is high
[2166.20 - 2172.44] flushing ratio pumping blood coming from
[2170.16 - 2177.76] the heart entering into the
[2172.44 - 2181.20] liver okay and these white blood cells
[2177.76 - 2182.80] they're adapted to high oxygen levels in
[2181.20 - 2186.20] High Extreme blood
[2182.80 - 2188.52] flow whereas hepatic portal vein white
[2186.20 - 2190.28] blood cells
[2188.52 - 2192.84] they can't they can't they they can
[2190.28 - 2195.44] survive they can survive in other ways
[2192.84 - 2197.48] with lack of oxygen they're different
[2195.44 - 2199.72] there's there's two different buggies
[2197.48 - 2202.84] they're not buggies two different immune
[2199.72 - 2205.96] cells two different immune
[2202.84 - 2209.48] cells one can survive high oxygen and
[2205.96 - 2211.76] high blood flow another one can survive
[2209.48 - 2214.60] low oxygen and lots of
[2211.76 - 2217.76] poison that's the difference that's the
[2214.60 - 2220.12] difference right there research in
[2217.76 - 2222.24] science I don't know 40 years from now
[2220.12 - 2224.12] on this one although they'll still be
[2222.24 - 2225.68] studying genetics I forgot and they'll
[2224.12 - 2227.36] still be you know make you know wanting
[2225.68 - 2229.48] everybody to do a genetic test on you
[2227.36 - 2231.56] know TV commercials and all that so
[2229.48 - 2232.88] looking for your heritage and stuff
[2231.56 - 2234.76] they'll still be wanting to do that so
[2232.88 - 2238.04] they can collect all your
[2234.76 - 2239.48] DNA it's unbelievable so they just play
[2238.04 - 2242.48] with it more and more until they like
[2239.48 - 2244.28] clone people down the road said they
[2242.48 - 2245.92] don't even care about chronic illness
[2244.28 - 2247.80] telling you science and research doesn't
[2245.92 - 2249.92] even care about chronic illness they
[2247.80 - 2252.44] just don't the people working for them
[2249.92 - 2253.88] do they do but they're they're they have
[2252.44 - 2255.52] bosses they're all under they're all
[2253.88 - 2258.32] under direction or they they're out of a
[2255.52 - 2261.80] job so the bottom line
[2258.32 - 2265.16] is this is how it works so that that
[2261.80 - 2268.24] group of of that group of immune cells
[2265.16 - 2270.76] that sit in that artery area with high
[2268.24 - 2272.28] oxygen highspeed blood flow coming
[2270.76 - 2275.60] through
[2272.28 - 2277.44] okay they know how to swim
[2275.60 - 2280.24] aggressively
[2277.44 - 2282.92] they know how to swim aggressively they
[2280.24 - 2284.80] can handle it under a microscope if
[2282.92 - 2286.52] these immune study if these immune cells
[2284.80 - 2288.64] were ever on the radar of science and
[2286.52 - 2290.84] research if they were ever on the radar
[2288.64 - 2294.00] if they were ever of even interest in
[2290.84 - 2294.00] today's world of
[2294.80 - 2298.16] medicine they they first of all science
[2297.08 - 2299.88] researcher probably think they're all
[2298.16 - 2302.32] the same at first but there's subtle
[2299.88 - 2305.52] differences that mean everything and
[2302.32 - 2308.76] that would take years of
[2305.52 - 2311.40] study so just the three I'm talking
[2308.76 - 2312.76] about the three the three main units I'm
[2311.40 - 2315.32] even talking about out of the six main
[2312.76 - 2317.12] units right now they're they're
[2315.32 - 2318.96] different they're subtly different in so
[2317.12 - 2321.88] many
[2318.96 - 2323.44] ways that's how it works all three of
[2321.88 - 2326.64] these white blood cell types are
[2323.44 - 2329.60] incredible swimmers they all can
[2326.64 - 2332.32] swim they can even go against the
[2329.60 - 2334.56] currents with a rare ability to go
[2332.32 - 2337.24] against these currents in such a way to
[2334.56 - 2339.32] pursue guess what pathogen the very
[2337.24 - 2341.76] thing that's keeping everybody sick
[2339.32 - 2345.32] that's giving everybody everything from
[2341.76 - 2347.12] acne to ECMO psoriasis to oh my God to
[2345.32 - 2348.64] Everything Under the Sun that to all the
[2347.12 - 2351.36] different diseases and illnesses that
[2348.64 - 2352.72] are listed in the liver rescue book to
[2351.36 - 2354.64] everything else in the medical medium
[2352.72 - 2356.68] series that's listed in there thyroid
[2354.64 - 2358.68] problems and then all the different all
[2356.68 - 2362.40] the other different stuff that's in
[2358.68 - 2363.92] there athletes to the highest degree
[2362.40 - 2367.12] these immune cells
[2363.92 - 2369.48] are they have a special
[2367.12 - 2371.48] shape that science and research hasn't
[2369.48 - 2375.32] even yet to discover that allows them to
[2371.48 - 2380.00] hover in an area of rushing blood like a
[2375.32 - 2383.32] grizzly bear waiting against dangerous
[2380.00 - 2386.96] Rapids to snatch a migrating
[2383.32 - 2390.36] salmon I mean come on that's how that's
[2386.96 - 2392.32] how powerful our body is it's incredible
[2390.36 - 2393.84] and when a pathogen escapes from these
[2392.32 - 2395.68] Secret Service agents cuz that's what
[2393.84 - 2398.08] they're like these secret Ser servant AG
[2395.68 - 2400.28] when a pathogen actually escapes at the
[2398.08 - 2401.92] liver's entry entryways where they are
[2400.28 - 2403.72] they find themselves up against the
[2401.92 - 2406.80] liver's next Defence which I'm going
[2403.72 - 2408.76] into and these are the other three of
[2406.80 - 2410.04] the six if I think I covered them all
[2408.76 - 2412.08] they're say you know what I hope I
[2410.04 - 2415.24] covered them all already you got to get
[2412.08 - 2417.60] the live rescue book I can't do it all
[2415.24 - 2419.44] in the show this D this show is a little
[2417.60 - 2421.68] bit you know about having fun too we got
[2419.44 - 2424.08] we have to have fun why we're doing it I
[2421.68 - 2428.96] guess it's a little hard to get it all
[2424.08 - 2433.12] done so the next defense are these lobu
[2428.96 - 2436.64] white liver lobu cells these are immune
[2433.12 - 2439.28] cells they're personalized
[2436.64 - 2443.00] guards so these
[2439.28 - 2446.68] protect parts of the inside of the liver
[2443.00 - 2448.96] so these lobu white blood cells they
[2446.68 - 2451.12] border the capillaries and other blood
[2448.96 - 2453.84] vessels within the liver on the lookout
[2451.12 - 2455.96] for Invaders like Epstein bar that
[2453.84 - 2457.52] escaped and by the way Epstein bar is
[2455.96 - 2459.72] respons responsible for Hepatitis A
[2457.52 - 2461.72] Hepatitis B hepatitis C hepatitis D
[2459.72 - 2464.76] Hepatitis
[2461.72 - 2467.24] E just for the
[2464.76 - 2469.52] record as well as also a zillion
[2467.24 - 2471.16] undiscovered autoimmune conditions of
[2469.52 - 2473.56] the liver I know there's not a zillion
[2471.16 - 2474.88] of them I know that but that's what it's
[2473.56 - 2477.28] that's what it's turning out to be
[2474.88 - 2477.28] something
[2477.60 - 2483.28] close so that's that's one that's one
[2481.92 - 2486.68] variety of the immune system right there
[2483.28 - 2488.32] sitting inside the liver so look grade
[2486.68 - 2490.64] viral infections inside the liver that
[2488.32 - 2492.00] go undetected by medical communities
[2490.64 - 2494.44] these white blood cells I was just
[2492.00 - 2496.20] talking about this one this one set of
[2494.44 - 2498.56] our our immune system out of the six
[2496.20 - 2500.28] main units these white blood cells have
[2498.56 - 2503.20] a license to
[2500.28 - 2504.60] kill their job is more difficult than
[2503.20 - 2508.36] the white blood cells that were guarding
[2504.60 - 2511.32] the liver's entryways so this liver L
[2508.36 - 2513.52] this liver lob white blood cell that
[2511.32 - 2516.92] sits inside the
[2513.52 - 2517.80] liver it has a much more
[2516.92 - 2520.48] difficult
[2517.80 - 2523.48] job than the ones that guarded the
[2520.48 - 2525.56] hepatic portal Highway the veins both
[2523.48 - 2527.00] the veins and the arteries that I was
[2525.56 - 2530.60] talking about
[2527.00 - 2533.68] before so this is an entirely different
[2530.60 - 2535.92] blood cell white blood cell it has a
[2533.68 - 2537.88] license to kill anything that escapes
[2535.92 - 2539.60] and enters the liver this one's way more
[2537.88 - 2543.32] aggressive
[2539.60 - 2546.84] too because your liver here's how it
[2543.32 - 2549.40] works your liver is your body's
[2546.84 - 2551.76] filter so it can be filled with any
[2549.40 - 2553.72] number of toxins that get in the way of
[2551.76 - 2555.88] white blood cells work so when these
[2553.72 - 2559.32] white blood cells have to do their work
[2555.88 - 2561.12] these toxins get in the way all the time
[2559.32 - 2562.68] these blood cells have to be stronger
[2561.12 - 2564.96] and even
[2562.68 - 2567.24] better it's like the soldiers on the
[2564.96 - 2568.96] Battleground unable to see clearly from
[2567.24 - 2571.40] the smoke of burning buildings because
[2568.96 - 2573.56] there's so much going on and there's
[2571.40 - 2576.68] heavy metal runoff inside our liver
[2573.56 - 2578.16] there's viral and bacterial waste waste
[2576.68 - 2580.32] from Epstein bar sitting in the liver
[2578.16 - 2581.84] for 20 years just built up and built up
[2580.32 - 2583.40] and built up there's junk in there
[2581.84 - 2585.68] there's all kinds of stuff there's old
[2583.40 - 2588.00] pesticides even DDT is in all of our
[2585.68 - 2591.08] livers you better believe it's there
[2588.00 - 2594.00] it's still in all the eagles DDT is
[2591.08 - 2598.52] still in every single Eagle every single
[2594.00 - 2602.28] Eagle on the planet in the US has DDT in
[2598.52 - 2604.28] it the eagle eggs still have DDT in it
[2602.28 - 2606.64] we don't have any DDT in us oh no we
[2604.28 - 2609.28] don't have any DDT in US of course
[2606.64 - 2612.92] every single Eagle does but we
[2609.28 - 2614.48] don't no of course not why would we have
[2612.92 - 2617.16] any in
[2614.48 - 2620.32] us so DDT and other
[2617.16 - 2623.08] troublemakers they muck up the liver
[2620.32 - 2625.00] that's how it works so these these white
[2623.08 - 2627.60] blood cells these
[2625.00 - 2630.64] lobu white blood
[2627.60 - 2632.36] cells have to really figure out how to
[2630.64 - 2634.48] attack these
[2632.36 - 2636.20] pathogens it's why keeping the liver
[2634.48 - 2638.20] clean like in Liver Rescue this this
[2636.20 - 2639.64] book Liver Rescue is so healthy and so
[2638.20 - 2641.32] critical it's part of protecting
[2639.64 - 2643.44] yourself from
[2641.32 - 2646.00] disease it's not just about liver
[2643.44 - 2648.56] disease forget that it's about every
[2646.00 - 2650.08] single illness you get it's about Lyme
[2648.56 - 2652.64] disease that's liver
[2650.08 - 2655.00] related it's about all these
[2652.64 - 2656.36] things it's about all the these things
[2655.00 - 2658.28] and by the way I've been saying this
[2656.36 - 2660.04] just not just from book one medical
[2658.28 - 2661.16] medium the series Lyme disease every
[2660.04 - 2662.28] single person with Lyme disease has
[2661.16 - 2666.16] Epstein
[2662.28 - 2667.80] bar I wonder why I wonder why there
[2666.16 - 2670.00] there neurological lime symptoms maybe
[2667.80 - 2672.28] it's Epstein bar it
[2670.00 - 2674.68] is because bacteria doesn't create
[2672.28 - 2675.84] neurological symptoms when is the when
[2674.68 - 2678.44] is the medical community is going to
[2675.84 - 2680.04] wake up to that fact alone and if that
[2678.44 - 2681.40] made you mad about Lyme disease I say
[2680.04 - 2683.76] this every show if I say something about
[2681.40 - 2686.04] Lyme disease because I've been I've been
[2683.76 - 2688.24] whiplashed from it so bad over the years
[2686.04 - 2690.04] if that made you upset get book one read
[2688.24 - 2693.36] the lime chapter learn the truth about
[2690.04 - 2695.76] Lyme disease don't don't stay in denial
[2693.36 - 2697.16] it's important it's important if you
[2695.76 - 2699.48] need need to bring a torch and try to
[2697.16 - 2701.28] burn my apartment down I bring bring
[2699.48 - 2703.48] bring a pitchfork bring a bring shovels
[2701.28 - 2705.08] and bring baseball bats and torches if
[2703.48 - 2707.08] you want because I because I said the
[2705.08 - 2708.52] truth about Lyme disease if that's what
[2707.08 - 2712.40] you want to
[2708.52 - 2714.48] do okay so it's it's so this is how it's
[2712.40 - 2716.44] so important that these these white
[2714.48 - 2717.88] blood cells really help so bio
[2716.44 - 2719.16] production is one of the top functions
[2717.88 - 2723.04] of your
[2719.16 - 2726.12] liver bod duct white blood cells are
[2723.04 - 2728.56] unknown to research and science and
[2726.12 - 2731.52] they're assigned to watch over the bile
[2728.56 - 2734.56] duct system there's an immune cell
[2731.52 - 2736.68] that's protecting your bile duct these
[2734.56 - 2738.96] cells are the only part of the immune
[2736.68 - 2742.20] system that could withstand B's harshest
[2738.96 - 2745.04] harsh nature it's an immune white blood
[2742.20 - 2747.40] cell that's not discovered or studied by
[2745.04 - 2750.28] science and research it has a sheath
[2747.40 - 2753.36] over it a membrane that could handle the
[2750.28 - 2756.68] harsh nature of
[2753.36 - 2758.48] bile it's got a protective C cover
[2756.68 - 2760.76] undiscovered by research and science it
[2758.48 - 2763.52] acts as a shield like a hazmat suit or a
[2760.76 - 2766.24] firefighter's gear the bod duct white
[2763.52 - 2768.60] blood cell looks for passer buyers in
[2766.24 - 2771.08] bile that may cause infection of the
[2768.60 - 2774.52] liver and gallbladder and dadum and
[2771.08 - 2780.64] intestinal tra that this white blood
[2774.52 - 2780.64] cell can travel upward and invade the
[2780.76 - 2791.16] stomach it can travel upward and NAB a
[2787.08 - 2793.92] pathogen that slips by that gets out of
[2791.16 - 2797.04] that bile duct it can even travel white
[2793.92 - 2799.36] blood cell will launch itself kamakazi
[2797.04 - 2800.52] attack you got a white blood cell that
[2799.36 - 2804.28] will kill
[2800.52 - 2807.28] itself it'll die for you is what it'll
[2804.28 - 2811.76] do it'll launch itself out of the bile
[2807.28 - 2815.00] duct into Uncharted Territory into your
[2811.76 - 2816.76] gut knowing it's eventually going to be
[2815.00 - 2820.52] destroyed and and its Shield is going to
[2816.76 - 2822.64] burn off its Shield is going to burn off
[2820.52 - 2825.88] and it's going to be annihilated but
[2822.64 - 2828.36] it's trying to stop a pathogen before it
[2825.88 - 2833.12] gets killed off and burned up by too
[2828.36 - 2833.12] much bile overtime and hydrochloric
[2833.56 - 2838.56] acid and it knows it can't find itself
[2836.68 - 2840.40] back or find its way back once it goes
[2838.56 - 2843.60] into the gut it's going to die
[2840.40 - 2847.48] eventually or get eliminated out of your
[2843.60 - 2849.72] stool or wherever it's going to go
[2847.48 - 2852.60] so this so that's how it works you got a
[2849.72 - 2854.64] ComiCon you literally got you literally
[2852.60 - 2856.12] got a white blood cell that will kill
[2854.64 - 2858.88] itself for
[2856.12 - 2861.56] you and it'll Follow The Invader as far
[2858.88 - 2864.88] as it can to try to stop
[2861.56 - 2866.84] it by the end of this journey the path
[2864.88 - 2868.84] basically dest ultimately destroys and
[2866.84 - 2870.68] kills the bile duct white blood cell I'm
[2868.84 - 2873.16] talking about by burning away its
[2870.68 - 2873.16] protective
[2873.32 - 2879.48] cover it's suicide mission
[2876.24 - 2882.40] was for pursuing the
[2879.48 - 2884.52] pathogen which is that incredible that's
[2882.40 - 2887.60] your liver so do we still want to hurt
[2884.52 - 2889.52] our liver do we still want to you know I
[2887.60 - 2891.84] mean look we're not educated about
[2889.52 - 2893.88] eating right I get that that's not what
[2891.84 - 2895.96] I'm up with that you know what I don't
[2893.88 - 2898.52] care I don't care if someone is eating
[2895.96 - 2899.96] fast food and they're not educated about
[2898.52 - 2901.40] their liver or they're not educated
[2899.96 - 2902.76] about what diet they can do they're not
[2901.40 - 2904.40] educated what they should be doing to
[2902.76 - 2906.72] protect themselves in the liver's immune
[2904.40 - 2908.88] system I don't hold anybody I don't
[2906.72 - 2910.72] judge anybody on that on any level I
[2908.88 - 2914.16] don't judge anybody on that you better
[2910.72 - 2916.04] believe it you better believe it life is
[2914.16 - 2917.76] hard you're trying to survive you're
[2916.04 - 2919.20] going to fast food restaurant or you're
[2917.76 - 2920.56] eating wherever at a friend's house or
[2919.20 - 2922.04] you're trying to get your next meal and
[2920.56 - 2924.44] you're trying to just whatever you got
[2922.04 - 2926.24] to do and if you if you're eating if
[2924.44 - 2927.44] you're eating donuts and you're drinking
[2926.24 - 2930.20] whatever and you're doing whatever
[2927.44 - 2933.52] you're doing I I totally get it you know
[2930.20 - 2937.04] what pisses me off is when you're this
[2933.52 - 2939.16] Elite SL doctors slash trying to be
[2937.04 - 2941.24] public figure slash writing books and
[2939.16 - 2942.96] articles slash doing whatever and then
[2941.24 - 2945.64] telling people fruit will hurt your
[2942.96 - 2948.24] liver and stay on a high fat High trendy
[2945.64 - 2949.84] high protein diet oh bring in celery
[2948.24 - 2951.72] juice by the way where' that come from
[2949.84 - 2954.04] that came from here we know that medical
[2951.72 - 2957.92] medium that's that's one of those
[2954.04 - 2960.00] jewels and and that bothers me because
[2957.92 - 2961.12] then people get really misdirected and
[2960.00 - 2962.20] now they're on these other diets
[2961.12 - 2963.92] thinking they're still doing something
[2962.20 - 2965.60] for the liver yeah it's a little better
[2963.92 - 2968.28] than it was than if they were doing
[2965.60 - 2970.96] processed foods but let me tell you
[2968.28 - 2972.60] something it's it's not enough we have
[2970.96 - 2974.04] to protect your liver learn how to eat
[2972.60 - 2975.36] you're allowed to have some fats you're
[2974.04 - 2977.16] allowed to have some animal protein
[2975.36 - 2980.32] you're allowed to have some fats but you
[2977.16 - 2982.20] got to be cautious and you got to try to
[2980.32 - 2983.92] be careful on that protein tag that
[2982.20 - 2985.40] protein tag will keep you sick and take
[2983.92 - 2986.68] 10 years off your life down the road and
[2985.40 - 2988.32] does that matter it matters when you're
[2986.68 - 2990.16] 70 and you want it to live to be 80 I'll
[2988.32 - 2991.88] tell you that much it matters greatly it
[2990.16 - 2995.12] matters when you lose 15 years off your
[2991.88 - 2997.32] life when you want it to be 80 and you
[2995.12 - 3001.16] you lose lose it at
[2997.32 - 3002.60] 65 you want it to be 100 but you tanked
[3001.16 - 3005.96] at
[3002.60 - 3008.24] 80 I don't know it matters and if you're
[3005.96 - 3012.80] chronically ill and you wanted to make
[3008.24 - 3015.40] it to 60 but you made it to 40 it
[3012.80 - 3018.44] matters so it all
[3015.40 - 3020.92] matters so the bottom line is your liver
[3018.44 - 3022.32] has this unbelievable immune system we
[3020.92 - 3024.60] have to take care of
[3022.32 - 3026.56] it and then finally there's this other
[3024.60 - 3029.24] part of the liver's immune system the
[3026.56 - 3031.64] lymphocytes they Patrol the outer region
[3029.24 - 3034.28] of the liver these white blood cells
[3031.64 - 3036.68] tend to stay on the outside of the
[3034.28 - 3038.44] liver and they're like wa they're in the
[3036.68 - 3040.08] Watchtower positions and around the
[3038.44 - 3042.28] lymphatic fil these are the guys that
[3040.08 - 3044.68] are trying to stop all that strep that's
[3042.28 - 3047.52] pounding out of the liver that's coming
[3044.68 - 3050.00] out of the liver and going into up up up
[3047.52 - 3051.84] beneath the Derma and getting every
[3050.00 - 3053.56] teenager in trouble with all the
[3051.84 - 3055.60] different acne and the cystic acne and
[3053.56 - 3058.76] all the and everybody just everybody
[3055.60 - 3061.36] with acne that's a strep and so these
[3058.76 - 3062.84] lymphatic white blood cells these
[3061.36 - 3064.32] outside ones that are part of the
[3062.84 - 3065.96] liver's immune system that research and
[3064.32 - 3068.40] science aren't aware of yet they're
[3065.96 - 3071.08] trying to actually stop that kind of
[3068.40 - 3074.88] thing including like Epstein bar getting
[3071.08 - 3078.44] into the tonsils and causing tonsilitis
[3074.88 - 3081.16] mono and strep and all that other stuff
[3078.44 - 3083.48] that happens I love when someone says I
[3081.16 - 3084.76] just got a casol laringitis it's not you
[3083.48 - 3085.88] know not when they I'm not saying they
[3084.76 - 3087.96] have tonsilitis any when they have
[3085.88 - 3090.00] laryngitis I love that yeah no I just
[3087.96 - 3091.28] got laryngitis it's she's going away she
[3090.00 - 3093.08] been a couple of weeks I went to the
[3091.28 - 3094.28] doctor and gave me an antibiotic or she
[3093.08 - 3097.08] gave me an
[3094.28 - 3099.60] antibiotic and they get laryngitis you
[3097.08 - 3102.68] got laryngitis that's strep or mono or
[3099.60 - 3102.68] both or
[3104.00 - 3110.68] one yep it's a little bit out of strep
[3106.36 - 3112.52] Rano are both bottom line anyway so
[3110.68 - 3114.12] there's these lymphocytes it's part of
[3112.52 - 3117.16] the liver's immune system it tries to
[3114.12 - 3119.20] stop Invaders on the outside going into
[3117.16 - 3120.80] lymphatic vessels heading in there where
[3119.20 - 3122.96] these other lymphocytes are that science
[3120.80 - 3125.08] and research are aware of but those
[3122.96 - 3126.60] aren't part of the liver's immune system
[3125.08 - 3128.04] you got your lymphocytes that you
[3126.60 - 3129.64] already have the science research
[3128.04 - 3130.84] already knows about they got them tagged
[3129.64 - 3132.40] they got them they're on the blood work
[3130.84 - 3133.92] they're on there you can you can learn
[3132.40 - 3135.92] about them they're no big deal they're
[3133.92 - 3136.92] your lympo your lymphatic lymphocytes
[3135.92 - 3138.60] they're the ones that actually sit
[3136.92 - 3140.52] around your thyroid trying to protect
[3138.60 - 3142.44] you from Epstein bar there entering into
[3140.52 - 3145.12] it I talk about this in thyroid healing
[3142.44 - 3146.08] get the thyroid healing book I got 100
[3145.12 - 3148.84] condition
[3146.08 - 3151.08] and symptoms in there that you wouldn't
[3148.84 - 3152.40] believe that that that are part of the
[3151.08 - 3153.48] whole thing with epscene bar and the
[3152.40 - 3154.88] thyroid and everything you want to be
[3153.48 - 3157.32] Epstein bar expert get the thyroid
[3154.88 - 3159.32] healing book honestly that that book is
[3157.32 - 3161.72] that book is unbelievable for that but
[3159.32 - 3163.36] anyway the bottom line is the
[3161.72 - 3165.12] lymphocytes that are around the liver
[3163.36 - 3166.84] though those ones are different it's
[3165.12 - 3168.76] part of the six main units I'm talking
[3166.84 - 3170.48] about this whole time and those aren't
[3168.76 - 3172.40] discovered yet and those are there to
[3170.48 - 3174.68] try to stop strep or anything else from
[3172.40 - 3176.00] going further out and getting out and
[3174.68 - 3177.52] getting to the the point of causing
[3176.00 - 3180.48] tonsilitis getting to the point of
[3177.52 - 3182.88] causing acne getting to the point of
[3180.48 - 3186.12] causing some weird sore throat that just
[3182.88 - 3187.84] burns getting to the point of causing
[3186.12 - 3189.24] all the different fatigue getting to the
[3187.84 - 3194.48] point of causing all the brain fog
[3189.24 - 3198.08] getting to the point of causing UTI
[3194.48 - 3199.56] utti chronic UTI getting to the point of
[3198.08 - 3202.44] stopping all of
[3199.56 - 3204.76] that so we cover the liver's immune
[3202.44 - 3207.52] system not in its entirety I can't get
[3204.76 - 3209.16] it all done Liver Rescue has way more
[3207.52 - 3211.32] information about it I think I even
[3209.16 - 3214.44] missed one for you out of all of those
[3211.32 - 3215.48] we don't have the time and I even missed
[3214.44 - 3216.92] a whole bunch of other stuff about the
[3215.48 - 3218.44] liver's immune system because I can't
[3216.92 - 3221.52] cover all of that it's in the pages of
[3218.44 - 3225.00] Liver Rescue pick one up if you get a
[3221.52 - 3226.88] chance whatever go to the bookstore you
[3225.00 - 3228.36] can't pick one up cuz you can't budget
