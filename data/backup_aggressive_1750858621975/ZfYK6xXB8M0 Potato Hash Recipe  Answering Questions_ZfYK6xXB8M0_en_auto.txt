[519.76 - 522.48] information including like the sun

[526.72 - 529.92] it's really exciting what i've done to
[528.40 - 533.12] it so i added a book
[529.92 - 534.40] to this book basically and
[533.12 - 535.68] for a new edition you're not supposed to
[534.40 - 537.76] do that and i broke the rules and i

[542.56 - 546.24] and the menu plans dosages and
[544.80 - 549.44] supplements
[546.24 - 551.68] this book basically this book already
[549.44 - 552.56] i mean what it's done around the world
[551.68 - 554.96] right now
[552.56 - 555.68] and then i expanded upon it is what
[554.96 - 559.36] happened
[555.68 - 561.28] so i mean i'm just really really excited
[559.36 - 563.52] about you guys getting it
[561.28 - 564.40] and having it in your hands i can't wait
[563.52 - 567.12] for that day
[564.40 - 568.88] um you know you can pre-order it now so
[567.12 - 570.48] i'm making the recipe that i was just
[568.88 - 573.44] showing you right here
[570.48 - 574.88] okay it's a morning hash and that's the
[573.44 - 575.68] recipe i don't know if you guys can see
[574.88 - 579.44] it so that's
[575.68 - 580.80] in the new book this is my manuscript so
[579.44 - 582.48] this isn't the book itself but this is
[580.80 - 586.24] my manuscript right here
[582.48 - 587.68] um before i hand it in to the publisher
[586.24 - 590.08] there's more information on chronic
[587.68 - 591.04] fatigue syndrome in the new book more
[590.08 - 592.72] information
[591.04 - 594.56] about lupus there's more information
[592.72 - 597.84] about epstein-barr
[594.56 - 599.44] in the new book so i'm reading that
[597.84 - 601.36] question right there
[599.44 - 603.20] there's a depression chapter really
[601.36 - 605.92] important one
[603.20 - 606.88] migraines and headaches chapter thyroid
[605.92 - 608.72] chapter
[606.88 - 611.44] additional information there shingles
[608.72 - 613.68] chapter and
[611.44 - 615.60] like what happens is that people didn't
[613.68 - 616.64] even know what shingles even cost like
[615.60 - 618.08] what conditions
[616.64 - 620.96] they just thought it was a rash and that
[618.08 - 621.92] was it like a rash and that was all it
[620.96 - 624.96] was
[621.92 - 626.40] and shingles is a lot more than that
[624.96 - 628.00] because shingles causes trigeminal
[626.40 - 629.12] neuralgia now that's medical medium
[628.00 - 631.04] information that's
[629.12 - 633.12] that came from that book and and before
[631.04 - 634.80] it colitis
[633.12 - 637.44] anybody with colitis you know that's the
[634.80 - 640.00] shingles virus that causes colitis
[637.44 - 641.12] so that's something there that is
[640.00 - 643.12] important to know
[641.12 - 644.96] sciatic pain you know this whole sciatic
[643.12 - 645.44] pain the nerve pain the back pain people
[644.96 - 646.56] get
[645.44 - 648.56] when they're just they're hurting
[646.56 - 649.36] they've got the pain down the leg but
[648.56 - 651.60] yet
[649.36 - 653.28] but yet it shouldn't be causing them a
[651.60 - 654.96] problem they don't have that much of a
[653.28 - 655.76] problem with their disc or their lower
[654.96 - 657.28] spine
[655.76 - 659.12] and even when they get their lower spine
[657.28 - 661.20] adjusted or chiropractor says the lower
[659.12 - 663.76] spine looks good in all this stuff
[661.20 - 665.28] it's it's still inflamed they can't walk
[663.76 - 666.72] they got the worst sciatic pain that's
[665.28 - 668.56] the shingles too so i broke the
[666.72 - 669.84] information out about that
[668.56 - 672.84] being shingles and i talk about the
[669.84 - 676.64] different types of shingles and rashes
[672.84 - 677.76] um so it's really really a power power
[676.64 - 680.80] packed
[677.76 - 681.92] book um multiple sclerosis i talk about
[680.80 - 684.80] that too
[681.92 - 686.80] and so when you get the new edition
[684.80 - 688.88] revised and expanded
[686.80 - 690.32] it's a game changer i put a whole
[688.88 - 692.08] another book into this
[690.32 - 694.16] it's really incredible so i want to talk
[692.08 - 696.32] about lyme disease too a little bit
[694.16 - 698.40] in a little bit right now i'm cooking
[696.32 - 702.48] this up and
[698.40 - 704.24] lyme disease is there's really a tragic
[702.48 - 707.68] history with lyme disease
[704.24 - 711.36] and i expose that tragic history
[707.68 - 712.00] um and talk about how you know people
[711.36 - 714.48] were
[712.00 - 716.56] taken advantage of they dumped they
[714.48 - 719.12] dumped antibiotics in people
[716.56 - 719.92] just hundreds of thousands of people
[719.12 - 722.16] back in the old
[719.92 - 724.16] in the old days back 20 years ago 30
[722.16 - 726.40] years ago they still do it now they just
[724.16 - 727.68] pounded people with antibiotics made
[726.40 - 729.52] their symptoms worse
[727.68 - 731.20] pushed him into the worst neurological
[729.52 - 734.40] lyme conditions
[731.20 - 737.76] killed a few yeah killed a few
[734.40 - 740.08] so the history of lyme is really great
[737.76 - 741.44] it's terrible it's like the negligence
[740.08 - 744.24] the mistakes made by
[741.44 - 745.84] a lot of the old lyme doctors still
[744.24 - 746.72] still being made with the new lyme
[745.84 - 749.92] doctors
[746.72 - 753.04] many of them and
[749.92 - 756.88] the the wake
[753.04 - 759.20] of hell and just just
[756.88 - 761.20] negligence of people with lyme disease
[759.20 - 762.96] being told it's bacterial
[761.20 - 765.36] being convinced it's bacterial because
[762.96 - 768.96] big pharma wants to sell the drugs
[765.36 - 771.12] and has really destroyed a lot of lives
[768.96 - 772.08] and i exposed it for the first time in
[771.12 - 775.52] our history
[772.08 - 776.96] medical medium book one and so um
[775.52 - 778.72] that information is in here in the
[776.96 - 781.28] revised and expanded
[778.72 - 782.16] and i also release the truth about lyme
[781.28 - 785.52] disease
[782.16 - 787.52] how it's viral and
[785.52 - 788.96] that original book medical medium book
[787.52 - 791.68] one you guys
[788.96 - 794.24] um millions of copies went around the
[791.68 - 796.56] world it's the most popular health book
[794.24 - 798.16] ever in history by the way so this book
[796.56 - 799.04] right here is the most popular health
[798.16 - 802.40] book
[799.04 - 803.28] in all health history so um for years
[802.40 - 806.00] running now
[803.28 - 807.84] and because i expose the truth about
[806.00 - 809.84] lyme disease how it's viral so what
[807.84 - 812.48] happened though the power of that
[809.84 - 815.12] what it did was it forced the medical
[812.48 - 817.68] communities it forced
[815.12 - 819.12] uh science of research to have to take
[817.68 - 820.24] lyme disease out of the bacterial
[819.12 - 822.40] category
[820.24 - 823.60] so just so you know even though there's
[822.40 - 826.00] still some some
[823.60 - 828.08] lyme doctors trying to test for still
[826.00 - 830.72] some lyme doctors trying to test for uh
[828.08 - 832.48] lyme bacteria
[830.72 - 833.92] science and research above the lyme
[832.48 - 834.88] doctors have moved it out of the
[833.92 - 837.44] bacterial
[834.88 - 837.92] category so big pharma doesn't think
[837.44 - 840.00] it's
[837.92 - 841.76] bacteria anymore they put it in
[840.00 - 842.00] autoimmune and the reason why they did
[841.76 - 844.72] that
[842.00 - 846.32] is because of medical medium books and
[844.72 - 847.92] information because so many doctors
[846.32 - 848.72] follow medical medium books around the
[847.92 - 852.40] world
[848.72 - 857.28] so um i'm gonna put the lid on here
[852.40 - 858.40] this is what i'm gonna do
[857.28 - 861.20] cook that up a little bit i'm going to
[858.40 - 862.72] make the heavy metal detox smoothie
[861.20 - 864.40] what happens with people with lyme
[862.72 - 866.72] disease is they'll have they'll be high
[864.40 - 868.56] in toxic heavy metals
[866.72 - 869.76] and that's a thing anybody with chronic
[868.56 - 874.08] fatigue syndrome
[869.76 - 875.84] lupus chronic fatigue syndrome lupus
[874.08 - 877.44] fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis they're
[875.84 - 879.28] high in heavy metals
[877.44 - 880.48] people with multiple sclerosis symptoms
[879.28 - 883.52] neurological symptoms
[880.48 - 884.00] high in toxic heavy metals and so metals
[883.52 - 886.08] are a big
[884.00 - 887.28] part of it it's not just pathogens like
[886.08 - 890.32] viruses like
[887.28 - 893.04] i've taught about all these years it's
[890.32 - 893.52] um the combination of toxic heavy metals
[893.04 - 896.96] and
[893.52 - 898.80] pathogens um so that that's that's why
[896.96 - 900.88] the heavy metal detox smoothie is so
[898.80 - 902.48] critical and so important and that heavy
[900.88 - 905.28] metal detox smoothie
[902.48 - 907.28] is in the revised and expanded new
[905.28 - 908.16] edition right here you get it amazon.com
[907.28 - 910.56] is where you get it or
[908.16 - 912.56] barnes and noble it's another place too
[910.56 - 914.56] um you can order it
[912.56 - 916.40] so let's talk about the the the heavy
[914.56 - 917.76] metal detox smoothie right here do two
[916.40 - 920.16] cups of wild blueberries
[917.76 - 921.36] i got that so wild blueberries are
[920.16 - 924.40] really
[921.36 - 926.24] an essential part of this smoothie
[924.40 - 928.32] keep that in mind really really
[926.24 - 931.20] important part of that smoothie
[928.32 - 932.72] like really critical so we got that in
[931.20 - 935.76] there that's one thing there
[932.72 - 937.76] and i'm gonna put a couple of bananas in
[935.76 - 941.20] there
[937.76 - 942.56] that's what i'm gonna do so
[941.20 - 944.40] you guys just got on here i was talking
[942.56 - 947.44] about medical medium book one
[944.40 - 950.32] but they're revised expanded
[947.44 - 952.16] talking about toxic heavy metals this
[950.32 - 954.00] information in this heavy metal detox
[952.16 - 957.68] movie has healed people around the world
[954.00 - 959.12] adhd autism focus and concentration
[957.68 - 962.48] problems ocd
[959.12 - 962.48] the medical medium book one
[964.40 - 968.64] had the smoothie in there the heavy
[965.84 - 972.16] metal detox smoothie so
[968.64 - 974.32] ptsd that too so we got the bananas in
[972.16 - 975.84] there we got the wild blueberries
[974.32 - 977.44] and then i'm going to put some cilantro
[975.84 - 979.68] in here too
[977.44 - 980.56] because that's one of the key critical
[979.68 - 982.72] pieces
[980.56 - 984.40] now in order to get metals out of
[982.72 - 986.48] somebody and get them get
[984.40 - 988.88] metals out properly you got to have some
[986.48 - 992.00] other critical key pieces so
[988.88 - 992.56] a spirulina that's a must but what i've
[992.00 - 995.76] learned
[992.56 - 996.16] about products out there is that if you
[995.76 - 998.80] don't
[996.16 - 1000.48] have the right kind of product the right
[998.80 - 1003.68] thing is not going to happen
[1000.48 - 1005.52] that's just naturally what goes on so
[1003.68 - 1006.72] this is a spirulina the only one i trust
[1005.52 - 1008.96] right now on the market
[1006.72 - 1010.56] it's the only one and i'm not sponsored
[1008.96 - 1013.68] just so you know
[1010.56 - 1015.28] so i'm not sponsored by the company um
[1013.68 - 1017.60] but this is the spirulina so this is the
[1015.28 - 1019.68] vibragi spirulina vias and victor i am
[1017.60 - 1024.48] as in mary e-r-g-y
[1019.68 - 1026.56] and this is critic a critical part
[1024.48 - 1027.60] of getting the metals out corella
[1026.56 - 1030.80] doesn't work
[1027.60 - 1032.96] never did corella is toxic it's got
[1030.80 - 1034.80] problems it doesn't remove metals
[1032.96 - 1036.96] i recommend anybody who's doing corolla
[1034.80 - 1037.28] in my personal opinion i would never do
[1036.96 - 1040.48] it
[1037.28 - 1041.84] i talked about that for years and not
[1040.48 - 1044.96] just any spirulina
[1041.84 - 1047.44] so what you'll see is i used to support
[1044.96 - 1049.60] pacific spirulina because it was the
[1047.44 - 1051.52] decent stuff that was out at the time
[1049.60 - 1052.80] since then it's been a lot of years this
[1051.52 - 1054.96] is the best stuff
[1052.80 - 1056.00] that's out there now that just
[1054.96 - 1058.24] completely
[1056.00 - 1059.52] rolls over any other spirulina so it's
[1058.24 - 1062.80] got to be in the
[1059.52 - 1064.88] smoothie and it matters what kind
[1062.80 - 1067.20] you can get a really bad spirulina
[1064.88 - 1067.92] really cheap spirulina or a low quality
[1067.20 - 1070.00] one
[1067.92 - 1071.12] and then we get in trouble so that's a
[1070.00 - 1072.40] whole other thing
[1071.12 - 1074.00] um so i'm going to pop some of this
[1072.40 - 1075.12] spirulina in here for a second then i
[1074.00 - 1077.84] got to watch over the
[1075.12 - 1079.68] stir fry there so i'm doing the heavy
[1077.84 - 1082.16] metal detox smoothie while cooking a
[1079.68 - 1082.16] recipe
[1083.04 - 1087.04] just going to move this around so it
[1084.48 - 1088.16] doesn't stick this is cooking up nice
[1087.04 - 1089.20] right here i don't think you guys can
[1088.16 - 1092.88] see
[1089.20 - 1095.04] put the pan back on there we go um
[1092.88 - 1096.64] so just talked about the spirulina
[1095.04 - 1099.04] critical part of getting toxic heavy
[1096.64 - 1101.76] metals out of the brain
[1099.04 - 1103.12] out of the liver in my opinion and from
[1101.76 - 1104.24] the information i got from spirit of
[1103.12 - 1106.56] compassion
[1104.24 - 1108.00] and the heavy metal detox smoothie has
[1106.56 - 1110.64] really really
[1108.00 - 1112.56] not just changed lives it's saved
[1110.64 - 1113.92] countless lives at this point now around
[1112.56 - 1117.52] the world it's becoming
[1113.92 - 1120.32] a staple around the world um
[1117.52 - 1121.12] and i talk about that in of course the
[1120.32 - 1124.96] revised
[1121.12 - 1126.40] and expanded medical meeting book one so
[1124.96 - 1128.08] you know guys you know what's funny it'd
[1126.40 - 1131.92] be different if none of that happened
[1128.08 - 1133.92] it'd be different if lives weren't saved
[1131.92 - 1135.36] if millions of lives weren't healed and
[1133.92 - 1135.92] saved throughout the years with these
[1135.36 - 1137.20] books and this
[1135.92 - 1139.04] information and the smoothie and
[1137.20 - 1139.60] everything else and then i'd be sitting
[1139.04 - 1141.60] here like
[1139.60 - 1143.12] other people in the health field toting
[1141.60 - 1143.68] things in toting products and tote and
[1143.12 - 1145.92] stuff but
[1143.68 - 1147.28] no track record of of thousands and
[1145.92 - 1149.28] thousands and tens of thousands and
[1147.28 - 1152.32] hundreds of thousands of lives saved
[1149.28 - 1154.24] no track record of that you know of skin
[1152.32 - 1156.48] conditions getting better and
[1154.24 - 1157.60] you know adhd completely disappearing
[1156.48 - 1159.92] and you know
[1157.60 - 1161.36] migraines disappearing and stuff and a
[1159.92 - 1162.08] medical medium information has that
[1161.36 - 1164.40] track record
[1162.08 - 1165.28] and i'm actually really proud to say it
[1164.40 - 1167.76] because
[1165.28 - 1169.92] it's incredible because no other health
[1167.76 - 1172.32] community or no other health communities
[1169.92 - 1174.48] no other health authors have that track
[1172.32 - 1175.76] record of that many people healed better
[1174.48 - 1177.84] recovered
[1175.76 - 1179.12] with the tools or anything and but what
[1177.84 - 1180.88] they do is they take medical medium
[1179.12 - 1182.72] information they take the tidbits
[1180.88 - 1184.24] and they sprinkle other stuff around it
[1182.72 - 1184.80] so they try to get people some results
[1184.24 - 1187.04] by taking
[1184.80 - 1189.04] mm info throughout the years this is the
[1187.04 - 1190.32] barley grass juice powder
[1189.04 - 1191.60] here's the here's another thing about
[1190.32 - 1193.28] the barley grass cheese first this is
[1191.60 - 1194.16] the vimergy barley grass juice powder v
[1193.28 - 1197.36] is in victor i
[1194.16 - 1200.00] am as in mary er gy
[1197.36 - 1200.96] okay and same thing with the spirulina
[1200.00 - 1203.76] so
[1200.96 - 1205.44] now you can use a barley grass cheese
[1203.76 - 1207.52] powder doesn't mean it's gonna work
[1205.44 - 1208.64] and grab onto the metals it doesn't mean
[1207.52 - 1211.12] it's going to help assist
[1208.64 - 1213.12] getting the metals out keep that in mind
[1211.12 - 1214.96] a lot of people use barley grass
[1213.12 - 1216.40] doesn't work at all so that's something
[1214.96 - 1219.28] also to keep in mind
[1216.40 - 1220.72] um but this is the best stuff there is
[1219.28 - 1221.84] it's barley grass cheese powder i just
[1220.72 - 1223.28] put a little bit of put a little bit
[1221.84 - 1224.72] more in here and that's the vimeragey
[1223.28 - 1226.00] barley grass juice better it's another
[1224.72 - 1229.28] essential ingredient
[1226.00 - 1230.16] to getting metals safely out you can't
[1229.28 - 1233.44] get metals
[1230.16 - 1234.08] out with just garlic you can't get
[1233.44 - 1238.24] metals
[1234.08 - 1240.56] out with just cilantro by itself so much
[1238.24 - 1243.68] just won't do the job
[1240.56 - 1246.32] it has to be a certain blend of
[1243.68 - 1249.12] ingredients i talk about so
[1246.32 - 1249.92] here's the atlantic sea vegetable dulce
[1249.12 - 1251.04] right here
[1249.92 - 1252.96] so it's going to go in the heavy metal
[1251.04 - 1254.48] detox smoothie okay
[1252.96 - 1257.12] just want to keep an eye on this right
[1254.48 - 1257.12] here you guys
[1258.01 - 1264.48] [Music]
[1260.88 - 1266.64] so um so this is the dolls right here
[1264.48 - 1268.24] that's another essential ingredient you
[1266.64 - 1269.36] don't need a lot of it you can just do a
[1268.24 - 1271.20] nice little strip
[1269.36 - 1272.56] do anywhere from teaspoon to a
[1271.20 - 1274.08] tablespoon okay
[1272.56 - 1276.40] but i'm doing a couple strips in there
[1274.08 - 1278.24] and that heavy metal detox smoothie
[1276.40 - 1279.76] so i got that in there like i put the
[1278.24 - 1282.32] cilantro in there you got the wild
[1279.76 - 1284.64] blueberries in there okay and then
[1282.32 - 1286.56] what i do is the wild blueberry powder
[1284.64 - 1287.84] all right it's a vimergy wild blueberry
[1286.56 - 1290.08] powder right there
[1287.84 - 1291.36] and what i call this is blue gold is
[1290.08 - 1294.88] what i call it
[1291.36 - 1297.20] so i put that in there too additionally
[1294.88 - 1298.08] now regular cultivator blueberries
[1297.20 - 1301.52] cannot
[1298.08 - 1304.96] remove metals cannot remove
[1301.52 - 1307.04] metals i repeat a regular
[1304.96 - 1309.44] it does even if it's organic a regular
[1307.04 - 1312.64] blueberry that's organic
[1309.44 - 1315.36] cultivated regular blueberry organic
[1312.64 - 1317.12] will not assist in getting toxic heavy
[1315.36 - 1318.56] metals out of the liver or the brain or
[1317.12 - 1321.60] anywhere out of your body
[1318.56 - 1323.52] it has to be a wild blueberry that gets
[1321.60 - 1326.16] the metals out but
[1323.52 - 1328.32] it needs also to have the company of the
[1326.16 - 1331.04] cilantro in the same blend
[1328.32 - 1332.00] or on the same day the dolls the
[1331.04 - 1334.08] spirulina
[1332.00 - 1335.44] the barley grass okay and you get the
[1334.08 - 1337.92] wild blueberries and
[1335.44 - 1340.08] you need the five critical pieces and
[1337.92 - 1343.44] that's what you need
[1340.08 - 1345.44] so i'm just letting you know um so i got
[1343.44 - 1348.16] that all set up here or rigged
[1345.44 - 1348.16] and then of course
[1348.56 - 1352.24] gotta have the orange squeeze in there
[1350.40 - 1356.08] you can put an orange in there
[1352.24 - 1356.08] squeezing an orange in that's what i'm
[1358.84 - 1362.56] doing
[1361.20 - 1364.48] right here so i got a couple things

[1708.84 - 1711.84] disease
[1712.48 - 1716.00] interesting so
[1716.56 - 1720.88] the world of lyme disease is completely
[1718.48 - 1722.40] changed
[1720.88 - 1723.76] it's now under autoimmune as i was
[1722.40 - 1725.84] talking about before because of medical
[1723.76 - 1729.36] medium books
[1725.84 - 1731.04] people i think don't realize that the 35
[1729.36 - 1732.32] years of medical medium information
[1731.04 - 1735.60] getting out there
[1732.32 - 1738.96] the amount of work that i've done
[1735.60 - 1740.88] they don't realize how many things
[1738.96 - 1742.40] are what they are because of all the
[1740.88 - 1743.20] work that was done with medical medium
[1742.40 - 1747.28] information
[1743.20 - 1749.52] getting out there it's amazing so
[1747.28 - 1751.36] the industry medical industry believes
[1749.52 - 1752.00] lyme disease is autoimmune now so they
[1751.36 - 1755.84] don't believe it's
[1752.00 - 1755.84] bacteria because
[1756.24 - 1759.60] of what we've done getting the
[1757.52 - 1760.64] information out there medical medium
[1759.60 - 1762.56] books

[1979.60 - 1985.84] memory loss focus and concentration
[1981.92 - 1987.76] adhd metals play a role
[1985.84 - 1989.28] and what people are doing with their
[1987.76 - 1990.64] metals is they're getting them out of
[1989.28 - 1992.08] their brain they're getting them out of
[1990.64 - 1995.36] their liver
[1992.08 - 1997.20] this is a big part of this book
[1995.36 - 2000.88] originally just letting you know you
[1997.20 - 2000.88] feel that onions trigger migraines
[2001.04 - 2008.08] no but caffeine does i know that
[2004.48 - 2009.36] caffeine triggers migraines um
[2008.08 - 2011.44] that's a big one right there for
[2009.36 - 2013.44] migraines and
[2011.44 - 2014.96] it's like i got a whole migraines
[2013.44 - 2018.00] chapter in this book too
[2014.96 - 2020.00] by the way and it all depends like so
[2018.00 - 2022.48] is it you never had a migraine before
[2020.00 - 2024.40] ever and then the onion causes it or it
[2022.48 - 2025.60] gets triggered randomly with all kinds
[2024.40 - 2027.36] of stuff like
[2025.60 - 2028.96] you know stress triggering it and it
[2027.36 - 2030.24] happens to be the day the onions are
[2028.96 - 2032.80] happening or
[2030.24 - 2034.88] something else trigger it or you know or
[2032.80 - 2036.48] dehydrate it that triggers off migraines
[2034.88 - 2037.52] i talk about how migraines get triggered
[2036.48 - 2040.08] off
[2037.52 - 2041.68] toxic heavy metals viruses cause
[2040.08 - 2044.24] migraines i talked about that
[2041.68 - 2045.68] and revised and expanded um book right
[2044.24 - 2047.04] here the medical medium book
[2045.68 - 2049.36] his link is in the description so you
[2047.04 - 2050.64] get the right one chocolate's a migraine
[2049.36 - 2052.16] creator
[2050.64 - 2054.24] you can have chocolate two days ago and
[2052.16 - 2056.80] have a migraine two days later
[2054.24 - 2058.40] um and then what that migraine is is
[2056.80 - 2059.76] chocolate withdrawal so it's caffeine
[2058.40 - 2061.20] withdrawal from chocolate
[2059.76 - 2062.80] so people don't realize is they go
[2061.20 - 2065.20] through chocolate withdrawal
[2062.80 - 2066.56] every other day every two three days and
[2065.20 - 2066.88] they get triggered with all kinds of
[2066.56 - 2068.88] stuff
[2066.88 - 2070.16] they get triggered with everything so
[2068.88 - 2072.64] that's important too
[2070.16 - 2073.84] it's amazing that we're taught to eat
[2072.64 - 2075.36] chocolate
[2073.84 - 2077.84] and which is fine you could eat
[2075.36 - 2080.00] chocolate all you want just know
[2077.84 - 2081.28] that it's going to just create it's all
[2080.00 - 2083.12] part of the addiction
[2081.28 - 2088.56] you know it's it's really is the the
[2083.12 - 2090.16] caffeine addiction this is almost done
[2088.56 - 2093.52] and i'm about to plate it pretty soon
[2090.16 - 2093.52] put a little parsley on top
[2099.84 - 2102.72] if you're really hyper hyper
[2100.88 - 2103.84] hypersensitive and you're cutting raw
[2102.72 - 2106.24] onions
[2103.84 - 2106.88] and the sulfur from the onion is so
[2106.24 - 2109.20] cleansing
[2106.88 - 2110.72] it's possible that could if you already
[2109.20 - 2112.08] got migraines going going that you can
[2110.72 - 2114.64] get like
[2112.08 - 2115.20] something going on from that but it's
[2114.64 - 2117.68] it's
[2115.20 - 2119.92] not toxic but you know what triggers off
[2117.68 - 2122.00] migraines really bad air fresheners
[2119.92 - 2123.12] plug-in air fresheners scented candles
[2122.00 - 2124.88] are you around any
[2123.12 - 2127.20] scented candles at all because you can
[2124.88 - 2129.28] be exposed to a scented candle
[2127.20 - 2131.36] like a week ago and then be sick a week
[2129.28 - 2133.04] later three days later four days later

[2206.24 - 2211.20] that's what i'm going to do so i'm going
[2207.68 - 2211.20] to roll up some parsley right here
[2211.44 - 2215.84] and get a chop up some parsley real
[2213.44 - 2215.84] quick
[2217.36 - 2222.00] parsley is really healing and
[2224.00 - 2229.84] chopping up a little parsley
[2230.67 - 2236.48] [Music]
[2233.84 - 2238.08] i like to chop it up finely you can chop
[2236.48 - 2239.60] you can just put a couple of sprigs of
[2238.08 - 2240.32] parsley on this if that's what you want
[2239.60 - 2244.24] to do
[2240.32 - 2246.80] perfectly fine i like to chop it up fine
[2244.24 - 2248.88] throw a little bit on top i'll show you
[2246.80 - 2250.88] what i got
[2248.88 - 2252.56] let's just drop stuff and here we go
[2250.88 - 2255.44] that is it right there
[2252.56 - 2256.96] that's the morning hash that's a recipe
[2255.44 - 2258.88] out of the 45 recipes
[2256.96 - 2260.48] in the new medical medium book the new
[2258.88 - 2261.92] edition i'm going to put it right here
[2260.48 - 2262.88] so you guys can see it hopefully you see
[2261.92 - 2265.12] that
[2262.88 - 2265.12] and
[2267.60 - 2271.76] i'm hoping it kind of looks like that
[2270.32 - 2273.20] right there
[2271.76 - 2274.96] that's just look that's not what the
[2273.20 - 2276.72] photo looks like in the in the real book
[2274.96 - 2278.16] that you get this is just my manuscript
[2276.72 - 2279.84] i'm just letting you know
[2278.16 - 2282.84] that's what this is my manuscript so
[2279.84 - 2287.36] this medical medium new edition
[2282.84 - 2290.48] so and that's the recipe i just made
[2287.36 - 2292.56] looks good does it look okay it's piping
[2290.48 - 2297.12] hot i'll tell you that much right now
[2292.56 - 2301.36] so you want to taste it i saw that um
[2297.12 - 2302.64] so so cammy asks what candles are okay
[2301.36 - 2304.80] it has to be a candle that has no
[2302.64 - 2307.44] fragrances no fragrances
[2304.80 - 2309.68] maybe a candle that maybe have an
[2307.44 - 2312.32] essential oil of thyme or
[2309.68 - 2314.24] a little bit essential oil or rosemary
[2312.32 - 2316.00] essential oil of oregano
[2314.24 - 2317.84] that could be okay something like that
[2316.00 - 2319.92] but you but what happens is with
[2317.84 - 2321.68] essential oil candles they also put
[2319.92 - 2323.52] toxic stuff in it too so it says
[2321.68 - 2325.04] essential oils essential oil candles but
[2323.52 - 2326.00] it's also toxic they use toxic
[2325.04 - 2327.92] fragrances
[2326.00 - 2329.28] just keep in mind about that scented
[2327.92 - 2330.72] candles are probably one of the most
[2329.28 - 2334.48] destructive
[2330.72 - 2336.48] um to the body and it's crazy what
[2334.48 - 2338.84] happens is you'll see out there
[2336.48 - 2341.68] as you'll see perfumes colognes scented
[2338.84 - 2345.44] candles uh air fresheners are so
[2341.68 - 2347.92] toxic right and they're so toxic
[2345.44 - 2349.60] and at the same time there's all these
[2347.92 - 2351.36] people in the health field using them so
[2349.60 - 2353.44] you got all these people on instagram
[2351.36 - 2355.12] all these people on youtube and they're
[2353.44 - 2355.76] so health conscious and spiritually
[2355.12 - 2356.96] conscious
[2355.76 - 2358.56] and they're showing their health
[2356.96 - 2360.16] products and they're showing their like
[2358.56 - 2361.76] fresh meals or whatever they got
[2360.16 - 2363.68] whatever they're showing and eating
[2361.76 - 2365.44] and as they're doing that they're also
[2363.68 - 2366.40] burning scented candles in their house
[2365.44 - 2368.24] they're doing that
[2366.40 - 2370.24] they're they're they have air fresheners
[2368.24 - 2372.64] going on they got perfumes colognes
[2370.24 - 2374.32] all kinds of stuff like that and i know
[2372.64 - 2377.04] because a friend of mine
[2374.32 - 2378.64] um walked into their friend's house
[2377.04 - 2380.32] after not seeing him for a while with
[2378.64 - 2382.40] everything going on right now
[2380.32 - 2383.84] and went to go see him and this is a
[2382.40 - 2386.32] person that's an influencer out there
[2383.84 - 2389.20] doing stuff went to go see him and
[2386.32 - 2391.52] hit like a brick wall of just scented
[2389.20 - 2393.84] candles and all of that and it was so
[2391.52 - 2395.36] toxic like and that stuff is so
[2393.84 - 2396.08] dangerous so it seems like everybody's a
[2395.36 - 2397.76] health expert
[2396.08 - 2399.20] out there but they're burning their
[2397.76 - 2400.80] scented candles they're doing this
[2399.20 - 2402.00] they're doing that they're tanking their
[2400.80 - 2404.24] caffeine
[2402.00 - 2406.40] they're teaching other people how to use
[2404.24 - 2408.72] caffeine to get hooked on caffeine
[2406.40 - 2410.56] with the teas and the matcha tea and the
[2408.72 - 2411.84] addiction of all of it and the caffeine
[2410.56 - 2413.12] addiction and the coffee addiction
[2411.84 - 2414.24] coffee drinks and the chocolate
[2413.12 - 2416.16] addiction and
[2414.24 - 2417.92] it's like that's what that's how it
[2416.16 - 2419.28] works out there and
[2417.92 - 2421.36] sure you can burn all the scented
[2419.28 - 2422.64] candles you want i mean go ahead and you
[2421.36 - 2425.04] can do all the caffeine you want i'm
[2422.64 - 2426.96] just saying that these are troublemakers
[2425.04 - 2428.56] and then all the new clothing right now
[2426.96 - 2429.44] when you order new clothing any kind of
[2428.56 - 2432.32] new clothing
[2429.44 - 2434.72] it comes saturated there's very few
[2432.32 - 2437.20] articles of clothing that come
[2434.72 - 2438.72] without smell now it's saturated with
[2437.20 - 2441.36] fungicides perfumes
[2438.72 - 2442.80] colognes and people should start
[2441.36 - 2444.48] complaining because
[2442.80 - 2446.40] what the chemical companies are doing
[2444.48 - 2446.88] right now is they're bombarding everyone
[2446.40 - 2448.72] they're
[2446.88 - 2450.16] they're you know how you know women are
[2448.72 - 2453.60] worried about hormones
[2450.16 - 2455.52] one of the big hormone disruptors
[2453.60 - 2457.36] is all the chemicals and the scented
[2455.52 - 2460.56] candles the air fresheners
[2457.36 - 2461.44] the detergents the chemicals and fabric
[2460.56 - 2464.08] softeners
[2461.44 - 2466.40] the chemicals in all the new clothing
[2464.08 - 2467.12] are hormone destroyers they're just
[2466.40 - 2468.80] hormone
[2467.12 - 2470.40] destroyers so what women are falling
[2468.80 - 2471.84] victim to right now without knowing it
[2470.40 - 2474.32] they don't know this
[2471.84 - 2474.96] but they're being taught to like douse
[2474.32 - 2477.92] everything with
[2474.96 - 2479.04] perfume and clones stuff is highly toxic
[2477.92 - 2480.88] and
[2479.04 - 2482.08] actually throws all the hormones off in
[2480.88 - 2483.28] the body so then you got to go to the
[2482.08 - 2485.12] doctor and you got to get
[2483.28 - 2486.72] constantly get your hormones figured out
[2485.12 - 2488.16] and balanced and checked and
[2486.72 - 2490.32] meanwhile it's all this stuff just
[2488.16 - 2492.72] destroying you know the
[2490.32 - 2495.76] it's destroying the very glands that
[2492.72 - 2498.24] produce hormones in the body too so
[2495.76 - 2500.56] fabric softeners laundry detergents
[2498.24 - 2502.16] colognes perfumes scented candles
[2500.56 - 2504.32] this is a big deal and there's heavy
[2502.16 - 2506.56] metals in all of this stuff so
[2504.32 - 2508.40] that's why it's critical to be doing
[2506.56 - 2510.88] like the heavy metal detox movie
[2508.40 - 2512.16] and but you'll see people doing spinoffs
[2510.88 - 2513.76] they'll be like i'm doing a heavy metal
[2512.16 - 2515.60] detox smoothie they won't say a medical
[2513.76 - 2518.56] medium anymore and they'll be like
[2515.60 - 2519.60] i'm putting corella in here i'm putting
[2518.56 - 2520.96] this in there
[2519.60 - 2522.72] and it's not even going to help anybody
[2520.96 - 2525.92] has to be the right
[2522.72 - 2527.36] blend it's critical um
[2525.92 - 2528.48] has to be the right brent blend it has
[2527.36 - 2530.08] to be quick like i said if you're going
[2528.48 - 2531.04] to do the heavy metal detox smoothie if
[2530.08 - 2533.52] you want
[2531.04 - 2535.28] to be like looking out for yourself if
[2533.52 - 2536.72] you want to make sure you're protecting
[2535.28 - 2538.88] yourself when you're getting all the
[2536.72 - 2540.80] exposure from scented candles and from
[2538.88 - 2542.64] air fresheners and perfumes and clones
[2540.80 - 2543.76] on clothes that you order or whatever it
[2542.64 - 2545.76] is it comes
[2543.76 - 2547.28] um you just you got to make sure you're
[2545.76 - 2549.04] getting the metals out you know and the
